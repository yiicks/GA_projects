### DSI Capstone
Credits to a fun class and good team mates! :)

**Capstone Project at General Assembly:**
- Training and deploying computer vision model(s)
- Detection objective: frontal face images
- Classification objective: left vs right eye images

### Foreword
If you allow a few paragraphs, I would like to share a few thoughts on how my capstone reached this state of equilibrium you are seeing today.

```
Background.
This project is the de facto "culmination" of just over 3 months 
of coursework at General Assembly.
```

As a `digital native` generally familiar with what data is, but having fairly pedestrian competency (in coding, structuring, manipulating, and generating insights), I figured it would be fun to build something that hopefully is useful for fellow learners to accelerate their learning.

*Ideally:*
<center>
"Something useful" $\bigcap$ "my (currently) rather broad fields of interest"
</center>

Seeking something reasonably challenging (from a learning rather than data acquisition perspective) with practical real world applications, I settled on **CV** (computer vision).

In learning and execution, I realized there are many code references one can take to fulfill project requirements. However, there are also many hidden challenges, from troubleshooting GPU usage to deprecated references. For those relatively new to the field, it is worthwhile to "hack" your way to success. Do set time limits so you don't get sucked into "black holes"!

I hope the below offers reasonable breadth on the topic and accelerates your learning of computer vision. Feel free to share your feedback!

#### Learning objectives
1. Acquire data and build an image data pipeline
1. Clean and augment image data.
1. Train and deploy a computer vision model.
    1. Image Classification (CNN)
    1. Using Pretrained Models (Viola Jones, VGG16)
    1. Transfer Learning (VGG16 custom--failed)

### Content
Please view [main notebook](./Capstone_CV_01_main.ipynb) for models and details.

An [annex](./Capstone_CV_Annex.ipynb) is also provided to document some other experiments done as part of this project (what filters do, and the beginnings of a sliding window mechanism).

### Acknowledgements

A shout out to thank my instructional team at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), as well as the team at large for facilitating my learning journey. It's been fun learning with my coursemates and the GA community globally; thanks for the good times! Also, [Josh Starmer at StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ArSys5qHAU) has been a boon to society. :)

Thanks also to [IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg/) for their steadfast commitment to lifelong learning of digital skills and sponsorship of programmes like the [Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/imtalent/programmes/tipp).

Special thanks to old buddies and new friends I've made in the process of reaching out via professional networks / through social circles. If you're reading this, you know who you are! :)
