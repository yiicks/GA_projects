0,Got a offer at one of the first jobs I applied too. Reviews are TERRIBLE. Thoughts?,jobs,"30 years old, BA degree, lot of sales work history. Been working for myself for a while but the economy is hurting me, been working at a loss and living off savings for a little too long now. Looking for a work from home job due to vaccine concerns. 

Today was literally my first day applying, I tweaked my old resume, shot out about 10 interviews before getting a call to a job I applied to 3 hours ago. 

Some 3rd party call agency for health insurance, customer support. Seems I passed the preliminary phone interview and they want me to do a video interview tomorrow. 

I checked them out on glassdoor and its about as bad as it gets. 1/5 stars. Complaints about unreliable schedules, extreme work pressure, one call after another, terrible training, sketchy pay schedule, no time off, no breaks during 12 hour shifts blah blah blah. 

Only good thing I see is ""work from home"" and ""paid training"". 

After reading those reviews, I'm highly suspect. Thing is, I'm getting pretty tight on cash. Got bill money for February, pretty much boned by March. With my work history and degree I know I can do much better than this job though. Just something I "" quick applied"" too in between applying to jobs I actually want. 

I know I'm just looking for opinions here, but would you pass on this offer and keep applying to better jobs even if it means having to start selling personal belongings or working gig work while waiting for a better offer? Or, take the job, get a couple of pay checks for the paid training and apply for other jobs in the meantime? $15/hour 4 week training."
1,How does educational history show up on a background check?,jobs,"Most of the time my resume will be discarded due to lack of a college degree even though most postings have ""or relevant experience"" listed and I have over 2 years of experience in my industry. I have taken two nontraditional education paths (coding bootcamp, coursera course for PM) and am considering including the projected date of graduation and degree I was persuing on my resume. Will this get flagged in a background check? I know I am perfectly qualified for these positions - and am interested in knowing to what degree companies verify education (IE attended, attained diploma, etc)."
2,I was about to quit then I got a bonus and a raise?? Like how?,jobs,"So long story short, been with my company for 4 months and I was eligible for the 4th quarter bonus. I thought little of it because maybe it‚Äôs a sham but today my boss talked to me and I‚Äôll be getting one. Plus, he spoke with a higher boss and I‚Äôm getting a raise from $75k to $80k. I was about to quit because I feel so overworked, trained for failure because it really is bad, but he tells me He‚Äôs  seen growth and me taking initiative. So I guess when I decided to put a boundary when I went off at them for staying late again, heat of the moment, telling seniors to wait to get their report because I‚Äôm doing important, etc. like damn, I guess I‚Äôm doing something right. Any how, I would just say keep pushing and don‚Äôt quit right away. And always create boundaries!"
3,What jobs do I qualify for with these skills?,jobs,"Currently a rising sophomore in college so no degree yet. I know this will greatly affect my chances unfortunately because technically I have ‚Äúno experience‚Äù but if I work in retail again I feel like it‚Äôd be a waste. 


- Abobe photoshop, Indesign, Dimension, Acrobat

- Sony Vegas 19

- Microsoft Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel)

- Hallmark Card Studio

- Shopify website builder

- Wix website builder

- Wordpress website builder 

- basic HTML

- basic knowledge of SEO


What can I do with this? It feels like I‚Äôve wasted my time learning any of these at this point because I‚Äôm only ever getting callbacks from basic service and retail jobs. What the heck can I do to spouse this up or to lean in fully to marketing or design?"
4,Age requirement?,jobs,How old do I have to be to get a job? Any job really I just need to know the age requirement
5,When is an acceptable time to look for a new job??,jobs,Is it ok to look for a new job after a year at a company?  I know there is a lot of stigma around people only being at a job for a short amount of time but lets face it most people try and earn a higher income as the years go on which causes them to jump from company to company.
6,Help me decide please,jobs,"Ok so I have 2 options 
Walmart or The Habit Burger Grill

Right now I‚Äôm working for Walmart it‚Äôs been almost 3 months now. The pay is 17 an hour I work full time, 40 hr a week. 

I have a friend who works for the habit and the pay its the same.

The thing is she is offering me a job as a manager at the habit and the pay will be 18.50 but I feel like I‚Äôm not going to be able to handle all the stress and to be honest 18.50 it‚Äôs not enough. But at the same time that will give me ‚Äúexperience‚Äù for something better? 

Before I started working at Walmart, I worked for a restaurant I hated that place. I don‚Äôt enjoy working for a place where I end up dirty, sweaty, the smelling of grease, etc.

After I put in my 2 weeks at this restaurant I promise myself to not work again at a kitchen. 

(Sorry in advance English it‚Äôs my second language)"
7,I hate making mistakes,jobs,The ‚ÄúI should have known better‚Äù mistakes. I‚Äôve been in my line of work for 6+ years and making rookie mistakes really gets me down (I don‚Äôt make them often). At the end of the day it‚Äôs not an earth shattering mistake by any means but the client will be pissed and will blame me for dropping the ball and the higher ups will have to kiss their ass to make them feel better. Ugh.
8,"""Forced"" to quit",jobs,"This is just a rant. But I recently quit my job. I was there for not even 5 months. I am still upset because it is one of those jobs that has great benefits, decent pay, and lots of perks that people feel like they hit the jackpot when they get hired. I was so excited and prepared to work hard and get along with my coworkers. However, I quickly found out my boss was a big ol' jerk. He is one of those supervisors who is terrible at managing people and is only a supervisor because that is how you get promoted at the company. I was dropped into the deep end and was overwhelmed so quickly. I tried to keep up but I could not. I tried to create my own boundaries so I wouldn't burn out. However, this seemed to anger my boss. Then, at my 3 month mark when I was told I could start WFH, he told me I no longer could. It was the sh\*tty cherry on top of the sh\*tty cake. The last 2 months my boss would frequently question whether this was ""the right job for me"" and if I don't improve ""there will be issues"". He started to micromanage me and I would get so much anxiety because if I was unable to finish a task from the day before, he would question me on why and talk down to me. Even thinking about him gives me anxiety. I dreaded going to work because I never knew if he would just leave me alone or if he would be upset with me and ask me questions, I never had answers to. I was truly trying my best and it was confusing because on written reports he said I was doing a fine job,overall good and meeting expectations but not perfect. However, in person he would essentially threaten to fire me. Finally, a couple of weeks ago he told me again how he is disappointed in my work performance and feeling I have made no progress and asked me ""Are you happy in this job?"" with a tone indicating that he believes I am not. Not asking out of concern, but trying to make me realize I am unhappy. Going even further to question how long I plan on staying. I felt in this conversation, he really just wanted me gone, so I quit that same day. I am sad to leave many great coworkers and have to give up benefits, but this boss made me absolutely miserable. I am glad I never have to see him again but I will miss some of the things I was basically forced to give up.

and yes, I spoke to HR 3 times. Nothing happened."
9,Habit Burger vs Five Guys,jobs,"Can anyone that has worked at both give me their opinion on which is better to work at?

In terms of:
‚Ä¢ Pay
‚Ä¢ Work environment
‚Ä¢ Training
‚Ä¢ Enjoyment/fun
‚Ä¢ Progression (moving up and getting raises)
‚Ä¢ Job tasks in general

Or possibly which one you chose to work at?

I was a cook at In-N-Out and worked there for a little over 2 years and then left. So I‚Äôm in the position where both are eager to hire me due to my work experience in the past.

I‚Äôve scoured the web over the last couple days trying to find anything from anyone that has worked at both and found nothing. Indeed has pretty much the exact same scores for both. Five Guys is just a little bit higher in terms of Work Happiness and overall scores. If anyone happens to know a subreddit or a website or something that I can find what I‚Äôm looking for please feel free to link it."
10,I thought you all might enjoy the reference letter my favorite boss wrote me when I was applying for a job in student government as president of my school's honors society chapter üòÜ,jobs,
11,I'm pretty new and suspecting most of my team is considering leaving... what can I do?,jobs,"I don't think this has to do with me, but my team has no backup across important lines of business, with literally one person each responsible for a section of something that keeps the company running. There's only one person behind me that has been with the company for more than a year, and I recognize his frustration. Another employee recently took a suspicious full day off for later this week with very little notice.

If they left, I don't think I could handle it, because I've barely been here long enough to understand the business, much less the historical context on most of our work. I've been thinking about leaving before I get stuck holding the bag, but I don't know if there's anything I can additionally do to improve things. Has anyone been in this spot before?"

18,Any ideas as to why employers won‚Äôt email you back after applying?,jobs,"I started applying to jobs in October after I was let go due to ‚Äòstaff restructuring‚Äô. Since then I have not heard back from any employers, so just to test things out. I applied for positions I wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit for, and a few days later received an email saying exactly that.

It has been 3 months and no reply from companies that I know I would be a good for for. Absolutely nothing. I‚Äôve never had this issue. Any suggestions, thoughts, advice?"
19,Sh*tty coworker ü•≤,jobs,"So I‚Äôve been working at this job now for almost a year and the last 2 months have been a living hell. 

My coworker and I have gotten really close but lately she‚Äôs been coming up with the most outlandish excuses for why she can‚Äôt come in or she comes in VERY late. Our shift starts at 9am, sometimes she gets there late because she has to drop her children off at their day care which is understandable but one time she rolled in at 12pm as if it wasn‚Äôt a big deal even though I had to do some of her work. 

I feel bad because I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs like to be a parent and I‚Äôm sure that it can be very overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs been getting very out of hand lately. Today (for about the 4th time in 3 weeks) she pulled a no call no show, leaving me to do all of my work and when she‚Äôs not here I have to do her work. Mind you our office was closed yesterday in observation of MLK day, so there was a lot that needed to be done. 

I‚Äôm so over I I want to cry out of frustration. I‚Äôm hoping to get a new job offer this week because I deserve better than this and I feel like I am being taken advantage of because she was not like this in the beginning."
20,Offered a role at TEKSystems - should I take it?,jobs,"Hi all you beautiful people, I was recently offered a job as a Project Operations Associate (POA) at TEKSystems that pays $45k base, with a potential of 1k bonus per quarter, and a 3k overtime bonus yearly. It has a comprehensive benefits package as well as 3 weeks of accrued PTO. After 1 year, I‚Äôll be bumped up to 50k base and 4 weeks PTO. 


What is the work culture at TEKSystems like, for those who‚Äôve worked there? Is it worth it? Are they scamming me?"
21,Lowballed myself with salary range,jobs,"I know there's been posts like here before, but just thought it'd be helpful to get advice with specific numbers.

Right now I make 65k as a data analyst. When applying to the role I'm interviewing for now, I gave the range 70k to 80k, but am now realizing I should have said 80k to 90k (with the aim of hitting right at 85k).

Is this too big of a discrepancy? I'm annoyed at myself bc it's a great role but I wouldn't accept anything less than 85k (which after doing more research is not crazy/unreasonable)"
22,Uncle Buying me a House,jobs,"Hey guys, 30m here. From Southern California. I am working a remote job making $60k/yr. I am an account manager. Have a Business BA with recruiting experience as well which I didnt enjoy doing. I have about $20K saved. I dont like California at all (let alone the fact of the cost of the area), so ive been been working remote in Colorado and kind of traveling the country renting airbnbs to stay at a week or month at a time. 

My Uncle has an inheritance and he has no kids, so he told me he will buy a house/condo anywhere I want to live in the country. The deed will be under his name I believe but it will be ""mine"" as I can rent out rooms, sell it down the line to buy another place, etc. He is going to pay up to $450,000 CASH. I mentioned to him it may be smarter to invest in a couple properties with a down payment but he is adamant he wants to do all cash. In the meantime, he is giving me $1000/month until he buys the house because that is the interest he is making from the sitting cash. 

Thinking about renting out rooms for airbnb as well. And potentially buying another property down the line so I will be able to be financially free going the airbnb route maybe rental arbitrage as well. Not sure if I should use his money for a duplex or something to maximize revenue. 

He wants to get me a place once I finally pick a city to settle down in, get a job, etc.  Which may take a couple years. I guess I am in a paradox of choice. I find too many options in this amazing country and am realizing I cant settle down or date the way I am going. I traveled to Tennessee and the Carolinas in the past few months.  I love it there but realize being near the mountains in the great west is huge for me as I love hiking and backpacking. I just dont know about Colorado. Not to mention that 450K is about the average price here and that isnt even for the ""scenic"" areas. I would love to travel to Montana, idaho, etc soon. 

The only other factor is that I work remote, but there is talk about my work sending us back in part time to the office in Southern California to work part time (2-3x a week) in the next couple months. I definitely dont want to be in CA long term. I was going to ask them to continue working remote. We have a couple employees who have always been remote in Oregon and Arizona and Ive heard that we dont even have tax setups in any other state besides those if those states are even an option for me at all (because when they first began they were remote even before the lockdown).  If they say no to remote, I would consider going back in the office for 4-6 months to save up and then quit and move. If I can work remote I would think that opens up options for cities to live in that there isnt a job market in. But although this job is easy (work 7-4 but only have about 4-5 hours of actual work) and im relatively good at it, I dont find any passion in it and worry if I pick a place in a remote area to live in, what would I do to find a job if I leave this one. 

I want to settle down but at the same time im finding it hard. 

Not really sure what Im asking, just for general advice. Thanks."

And are they even allowed to let me work without having the background check back? I've been here for about a year through the temp agency
28,Employer offers to pay training but I want to quit,jobs,"I have been thinking about switching careers for some time now. I have been working at the same company straight out of uni, so for a few years now. But for the most part I'm unhappy and also experienced a lot of drama there throughout the years (but who hasn't). I was always too afraid to make the switch. Until now...

My current employer has sensed my dissatisfaction. In the past my supervisor and I discussed multiple times how I can progress within the company, but in the end nothing came out of it, due to the company's limited budget. In mid 2021 I came up with a proposal how to contribute more to the work-department to make the switch to better position. My supervisor accepted and together with my coworkers we are slowly working on redistributing work tasks, so I can transition to a different position. In the end of all of this, (my potential new position) must be approved by the board of directors. Since I have worked for this company for a few years now, I have witnessed that these negotiations can take place in the short term, i. e. right before the work contract ends. And I've seen colleagues getting screwed over in this process. 

So I'm skeptical and while staying at the company I'm working on my exit plan: I'm working with a coach to solve some job related insecurites and overall working on myself. I also recently enrolled in a qualification program to make the switch to the IT field. So far, so good. 

Now things progress at a higher paste at my current job: They have offered to pay for a training program, which I didn't expect. But I'd have to it in my free time, i.e.  a monthly training session Friday to Sunday. The certification program is great, and I would have enrolled myself, if it hadn't been canceled due to covid last year. There are two paying options for the certification: 900 Euro if the employer pays, 450 Euro if I pay myself. The latter one I can definitely afford. (I read that training agreements sometimes have clauses that require the employee to stay longer at the company. And of course the employer has to pay back the full fee, if they quit earlier than expected, which is also fine by me.) 

I still intend to quit my job, because this work field just isn't for me. But until I'm done with the IT program and until my work contract ends (late 2022), I want to expand my skill set to have a better resume. So I also want to do the company training. 

Do you have any advice on how to approach my supervisor, that I'd be willing to pay for the (company) training myself? Without being too obvious about me not wanting to stay there after my contract ends?"
29,90 day mark - getting an extension good or bad?,jobs,"All,

Basically I got an extension after capping my 90 days as a temporary. Potentially, I may get a permanent offer after the extension.

What do you all think?!?!?"
30,Office clerical/admin job seeking advice? New graduate.,jobs,"I'll have a BA in Anthropology this May. 24/M.   

I've been kind of figuring things out on my own with basically no parental guidance through my life.   

Lately I've been doing better managing anxiety &amp; depression and part of that has been looking for jobs that seem less stressful and easy rather than trying to force myself to do something that I think others would want me to do at the cost of my mental health. That's what led me to this question/post. 

I've only ever done transcribing online (hate it due to the pay but I'm not bad at it), and one month of training where I entered data into Excel from papers for my mom's friend years ago.  

I'm wondering both if anyone could give an idea of what a clerical or administrative assistant-type job would be like. I imagine they can vary a lot depending on the company? I think I want something public sector, at a school or for the city/state/county, but I'm still not 100% sure what these roles are like. Would my little experience and degree help me get a job like this? It seems ideal to me, as I love a slow pace and enjoy pursuing interests and hobbies in my own time (reading, movies, languages, etc.). Even 15/hour would be fine to start as I plan on living at home and trying to aggressively pay off student loans.   

I know I mostly need to get myself out there, but wasn't sure if that would start with just applying for these roles or if there's any way I could increase my chances of getting them, and I figure knowing more about what the positions are like would help. Any help is greatly appreciated."

32,How to deny a job offer from a previous boss that is insistent on having me back,jobs," 

Hello! I need some advice. 6 months ago I left my previous job due to the company not having a constant amount of work. Whenever we would get work it would have short deadlines in which I would work crazy to get everything done. I had asked for a raise many times since my salary at the time was basically pennies compared to what someone in my position should get but since the work wasn‚Äôt constant, management kept telling me to wait for a raise. 

After 2 years at the company I finally left. My boss at the time and his boss spent two weeks trying to convince me to stay by finally offering me a proper salary. I left the company anyways since I rather be somewhere else, I felt burned by them.

6 months later, I‚Äôm at this new company and everything is going well. I love it and the commute is great. My old boss called me and said they are getting the ball rolling on a lot of contracts and want me to join back. He also said that if I come back, in a year and a half when I can get my Professional Engineering license, he will make me project manager. 

Career wise, I think it would be the smart move to go back. But for my mental health and because my current company has been great to me the last 6 months I want to stay and not go back. How can I tell my former boss that I respectfully decline but don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges. Personality wise, me and my former boss get along very well which is the main reason he is insistent on getting me back.

Any advice will help! thank you!

TLDR: 6 months ago I left my job for another company, old boss wants me back. Me and old boss get along very well but I don‚Äôt want to go back yet. How can I decline without him taking it personally"

I also know that with the holidays and COVID surging, etc. that the workplaces are swamped right now and catching up on the backlog. However I‚Äôm ready to quit my current job and look for something somewhere else. 

The problem is I don‚Äôt see many new postings for new jobs in my field (Human Resources) and I apply to each one that does come up. I‚Äôm applying for the ones I‚Äôm qualified for and the ones I‚Äôm even a little under qualified for (just to take a chance). I completely revamped and updated my resume and added more key words that are generally used in job postings but I‚Äôm still not getting any responses. Not even rejections. The applications where I‚Äôve made an account and I can watch their progress have only gone into ‚Äúhiring manager review‚Äù status and have been sitting there for almost three weeks. 

Is anyone else having this issue? I‚Äôm just getting panicky cause my current job is getting worse by the day and I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a lag because of the new year but I also feel like I keep seeing a lot of people around me even in my fields getting new jobs."

Hi,

Just as a disclaimer, some of the exact amounts below may be a little off as I am working from memory. I work in a pretty niche field and have for about 15 years now with maybe a year and a half total without being employed. The industry is pretty incestuous. I started at one employer and have moved around to different companies in the same field in the area. I have been at the last around 7 years. I have a great relationship with ownership. The industry took a huge hit with the pandemic with many of the companies having to lay off nearly 85-90% of their workforce. Luckily I was not laid off and in fact only needed to take one tiny pay cut instead of most of the company that had to take multiple much larger cuts (I know this because I had to inform my subordinates of them). Pre-pandemic I was managing around 15 people. It is now down to two due to the pandemic and people finding other jobs. I am paid almost double what any of my reports are paid.

I started off at the current company making around $35K. I was prompted in a few years to management and eventually up to around $42K. I don't actively go search for positions but every so often someone that used to work at the office will recommend me to their current employer and that employer will reach out and ask if I am interested in hearing about a position they are looking to fill.  
Maybe a year in a half to two years prior to the pandemic I was offered a position at a competitor. They offered me a significant raise. I accepted the position and gave my notice. Within a day or so ownership offered me way above what the new employer was offering. I ended up staying with the company. Months later I was offered a position at a non-competitor for even more money (not a huge jump) but decided not to take the position because even with the increased pay the hassle of the commute did not justify the additional money.

I make around $75K now. Another competitor reached out to me about three weeks ago (I did not solicit - rather someone that used to supervise me works there now and threw my name in the ring). Within a day of interviewing they offered me $100K and a title promotion. I would be managing more people. The competition has 5 offices in different states compared to the one at my current employer. After careful consideration and going through all the pre-employment checks and passing I gave my notice. My current employer immediately wants to know what it will take to get me to stay. Although I am fiercely loyal to the current employer, this money is life changing for me. My state has extremely high cost of living. By breaking into six digits I can finally afford to purchase a home.

I honestly don't know what to do. I think this continued cycle of getting and accepting better offers and my employer continuing to beat them by huge margins makes me look bad to other companies in this small niche field and I am worried that I will be blacklisted obviously if I ever get let go from my current employer. My first instinct is to tell them it would take $120K to get me to stay. They have made it very clear time and time again that I am extremely valued. One might say though that if I was so valued why am I not being paid top dollar currently. I think some of that has to do with effects of the pandemic and a huge shortage of capital.

There are a lot of different factors at play here as far as future plans. But I can't ignore if someone, whether it be the new place or a counter offer from my current employer, is willing to pay be tens of thousands more. I mean if my new employer comes back and offers me $120K I do not know if I could resist another $20K a year.  I am not 100% sure the whole ""well if they can now pay you more then they have been taking advantage of you..."" argument really plays in this specific situation because we are talking about an industry that was hit very very very hard by the pandemic from start until currently.  90% of all works across this industry were laid off within the first 3 months of the pandemic and have still not returned.

Any advice on what I should do? This whole thing is stressing me out greatly like it did with the prior job offers and I am not the best at discussing these things and pressing my interests in verbal conversations."
45,How do I get my job back?,jobs,[removed]
46,Wages...........,jobs,"Hi, not sure if I'm in the right place to ask this question but i work part time whilst at uni for a golf course in the UK/England and get paid ¬£9 an hour at 20 but they recently posted an advert for another member of staff for the bar as we need extra staff but the wage says ¬£10.50 an hour on there? I work in the proshop, on the course doing greenkeeping and the bar so I do more than I initially signed up for yet ill be paid less? Spoken to fellow colleagues and they're on ¬£9 an hour part time as well. The job is advertised as part time too btw. How does this situation work? And how should i go about it?

Thanks"
47,Missed an interview with the president,jobs,"Silly me just mistook a 12pm interview for a 1pm interview, meaning I was showering when I should've been talking with the president of the company I really want to work for.

I'm going to go on a walk and float away (unemployed) into the void."
48,New job won't give me contract or let me pay taxes,jobs,"Unfortunately, this takes a little bit of explaining: 

I live in Ireland and recently got a remote job with a start-up German company (I do not know exactly if they are registered as a Germany company as there is very little information about them online other than a Linkedin account and a minimal website). I got the job in September. 

When I began the process with this company, everything seemed to be following a normal procedure. I was interviewed multiple times and told I was successful in my application. I asked in the meeting (when I was told I got the job) what was the situation with tax (i.e did I pay tax to my country, or to there's etc. as this is my first remote job so I wasn't sure how it worked). The CEO of the company told me that they would speak to his accountant about the tax situation, and when I asked about the contract, they told me that they knew security was important to me and they would be getting contracts sorted as soon as possible.

I asked about the contract again in a meeting in November and was told that another employee (who lives in Germany) was able to get a contract as the CEO used a family members company to contract him on that (I was wondering did he mean so he could pay taxes? But I don't know that was all he said) and that they would try get me sorted soon. 

In addition to all this, I was initially offered 1,500 a month, and that had the potential to go up provide I was producing quality work. A month after my first paycheck, I was told I would be doing half the work for half the money until things got better in the company. Could anyone give me advice on what the best thing to do is?

In addition: 

I know, of course it was stupid of me to leave my old job and take a new one without a contract, but I was honestly just very excited about the job and put down the lack of contract/tax organisation to them being a start up company and just not having everything fully organised. They were shady about talking about the taxes or the contract so I thought it actually would get sorted quickly."

50,Could use some advice,jobs,"So recently, after years of rejection, I found out I‚Äôm not getting anywhere with my life. I‚Äôve been working for the same company for 7 years and I‚Äôm just totally fed up and unsatisfied with how things are going. I got my resume and motivation professionally checked and it‚Äôs apparently not doing the trick for me. 

The thing that makes it even worse is that my job is paying me ‚Ç¨2000 a month. Now you might think that‚Äôs good, my bills all together are like ‚Ç¨1750 and you know what happens to the ‚Ç¨250 that‚Äôs left? Of course there‚Äôs gotta be a broken washing machine or whatever. I drive an old car because I need one to get to my job and can‚Äôt really afford a new one. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm the opposite of materialism, I don‚Äôt need to drive Lambo‚Äôs or ‚ÄòRaris, I guess I‚Äôm just really sick and tired of all these bills for at least the last 5 years, didn‚Äôt go on vacation, didn‚Äôt buy clothes. I basically had my own financial lockdown before covid had even started. I mean, I saved like ‚Ç¨750 now in the last 3 years I don‚Äôt even have words for it no more. 

Sorry for this rant I was just wondering if anyone knew a branche where they hire people ‚Äúeasily‚Äù and give a decent pay‚Ä¶not afraid of the dirty, 60hrs+ work either. 

Tldr: Stuck at current job, want to switch for better life conditions. 

Thanks a lot in advance I appreciate everyone üôèüèΩ"

55,People Manager role for someone who's not particularly interested in managing people?,jobs,"There's a role coming up that's mine if I want it. It is a position which will mean I will be line managing around a dozen people. I've never been particularly interested in managing people, but I appreciate that it's a great opportunity to gain management experience and will look great on my CV. My current role is a secondment which will end in a few months time. The management role will be approx ¬£3k per year more than my secondment salary, and around ¬£10k per year more than the job I may have to go back to when the secondment ends. One sticking point is that my previous manager has moved to another team that I would be very interested in (project work), and there is likely some jobs coming up in her team very soon. There is a lot of crossover with that team and what I'm currently doing on my secondment, and the team lead, who will be recruiting, used to do what I'm doing now. I did mention this to my current boss, who has given me this secondment and the management opportunity, but she doesn't want me to leave her team. Of course I have to do what's best for me, but I'm not sure whether to risk going for a job I would love but might not get, ending up going back to my previous role (definitely don't want to do that), or go for a job I'm guaranteed but not particularly passionate about (even though, after doing it for a while, I might end up lovimg it). 

Any advice, or anyone gone into people management who didn't necessarily want to? Thanks"
56,How normal is it for me to get a job without even landing an interview? Got hired the day after getting fired.,jobs,"Got fired yesterday, started applying yesterday too

today , had a stafffing agency call me and asked if i was interested in this role for a temporary staff accountant position, said sure.

called me back in an hour and said I start tomorrow at 8am. Was a bit surprised because of no interviews at all.. Pay is $25 an hour, paying more than the job i was fired from $17 (tax season data entry)

sure its a half hour commute vs the job i was fired from which was 2 mins away from home

I theoretically make the same making 25 an hour 40 hours a week vs 17 an hour vs 60 hours a week during tax season

But yeah, I understand its a 3-4 month contract role for this job , but how normal is it for to land a job THIS QUICK.. and the role is open because the person is on leave... 

Thoughts?"
57,Ask for a raise again straight away or wait?,jobs,"Last month I asked for a raise based on the fact I believe I've gained enough experience in 18 months to be at a higher level and that there is now 2 left in my department me being the most experienced in the role.

I got the raise which felt like a slap in the face 50p extra an hour for what is more experience and more responsibility. This raise was only considered as inflation based and take me from ¬£25 under what the minimum starting salary the job states to ¬£200 over that's it. This isn't an easily replaceable role it is a technical role that requires a decent amount of training.

After calculating after tax and bill increases my take home is currently an estimated -¬£500 from last year.

My question is do I immediately go ask about a raise again or hold off I've now begun looking for other jobs. However, I don't want to go back in again tomorrow possibly get turned down for another raise. Then having what would be obvious days off here and there going to interviews. I don't want any issues until I can go into the next job.

What would you guys do wait or ask?

At my current rate of salary increase I will hit the top of the salary for that role in 20 years"
58,Should I apply all over the US or local only ?,jobs,"To anyone who is/used to/was looking for their first job out of college, did you apply all over the States or only within your local city ? I'm a CS grad and I know there's lots of remote opportunities in this field but still plenty of companies require you to go onsite.

I'm still living with my parents right now and have no experience with moving and stuffs so this is kinda a dumb question but how do you deal with housing when relocating ? I mean I know that apartment hunting is a long and tedious process, should probably take couple weeks to find an ideal place to live and deal with all the packing, moving, setting up utilities, notifying banks/insurances, update id, etc. So until you are all settle in, where are you supposed to live after you got your job offer ? Hotel ?"
59,Thank you for applying to [company] emails when I haven't applied,jobs,"I've been getting a lot of emails that thank me for applying to jobs I haven't applied for. They use my actual name and they are all in the same field (which isn't a field I would be applying for jobs in). They are often followed up by an email letting me know they will not be hiring me, and most of them seem to come through a service called Comeet.

I have a few questions about this:

\- Does anyone have experience with this happening?

\- Suggestions on how to make it stop?

\- Just a harmless scam or should I be worried about identity theft or something? (I have never clicked any links or opened any files attached to these emails)"
60,Am I the only one who doesn't prepare for interviews anymore?,jobs,"I'm back on the job market looking for jobs again, and this time trying to focus on 100% remote jobs because everyone I know works remote and I've never had a remote job before. 

I'm 37 and have been on so many interviews that I learned no two interviews are exactly alike and no matter how much you prepare they never ask the questions you prepared for. Also learner that no matter how much I prepare I still suck at them. I just try to be myself.

So I've stopped preparing for interviews. Now I just read up a bit on the company and that's it. 

Anyone else do the same?"

63,What should we ask prospective employers about Career Pathing?,jobs,"In a recent discussion about my job, a friend told me that company is so far behind in career pathing it is sad, antiquated at best.

When going through interviews for a new job, what should we be asking about Career Pathing at that company?"
64,Leaving a short staffed place?,jobs,"My manager is a pretty decent guy and has always been on my side but I recently applied to and got accepted for a better job. We are really short staffed so I think things will be bad if I leave and my new job wants me to start pretty quickly and only leave me to give 2 weeks notice.

But they gave me only an 80 cent raise this year and that's with me working really hard. Like... I was hoping for something to at least match inflation. But the low raise had me rethink my future here. I don't have a lot of expenses so I know I shouldn't be greedy but I feel like I'm getting taken advance of if that's going to be the norm for raises."
65,Did I not get the job?,jobs,"I‚Äôve been applying to work from home jobs and got my first assessment test/interview within a day of applying to this job. This is the message I received this morning: 

Hello! Thank you for completing the the assessment test/interview. You did impressively well answering the questions and finished in such a short time. However, further review will be done and a decision will be made by the Company's head department to see if you are qualified for the job. Understood?

My parents are saying that since they said however‚Ä¶ that I didn‚Äôt get the job. Is that usually a sign?"
66,Started new job 48 hours ago. Unsure if it's right for me.,jobs,"I'm an anxious wreck atm. I managed to nail a pretty well paid job in computer engineering. But I was expecting to work on Windows PCs, unfortunately this job is 99% Apple products.

I've never owned an Apple product. And find it hard to see why customers are coming in buying these ¬£2000 Macbook airs. When the hardware inside it is fucking garbage and could build something for a fraction of that price with similar specs.

So a doctor came in. Brought in 2 ipads for repair and a MacbookPro. And he noticed on my terminal which is an iMac and was using a apple mouse. He pointed at it and said ""Those things are shit"" which I responded ""Yeah they are. I recommend a logitech G409"". And I got a evil eye from the boss. Because we're meant to upsell products. And the only shit we stock or order in is from Apple.

So I spoke to the boss and said. ""Look I understand you're going through a rebrand and hired me for Windows repairs. But I haven't seen or had a single question of which I can answer confidently. I haven't a clue what this stuff is. And I wouldn't recommend any of these products because i think they're overpriced and just gimmicky flash looking. That's it. ""

"" You'll learn, and one day you'll get your own station where we give you all windows machines for repairs""

This could be 6+months away. And I'm not sure if I want to stick about to find out. They're so focused on apple products it makes me sad. I literally give zero fucks about Apple and think the corporate wankers who own it are tossers. One of our biggest selling points is Extension cables and accessories....speaks for itself really.

I don't seem to vibe with anyone. As a huge gamer it's my second life. But obviously everyone there are Apple fanboys and cannot game at home. I feel really out of place.

I was given a Switch Lite today for a screen replacement because its ""Close to what you're used to""

A Nintendo switch is nothing like what Im used to. Getting my fat fingers inside that thing to strip it down was a ball ache. I feel so lost. And I'm being trained in a field I don't respect. Do I stick about? Or shall I just throw in the towel and make money elsewhere."
67,Had an intense 30-minute phone interview earlier,jobs,"First job interview in 8+ years for a non-profit organization who help the visually impaired and blind. I'm having to leave my current job for them due to decline in vision. I've never had a phone interview before and had so many brain farts during it. I had the most trouble talking about myself when asked questions like, ""How would your supervisor describe you if we asked them?"" or ""What are you strongest or weakest aspects?"" Questions like that make me so nervous because I'm not used to talking about myself and always fear about giving false impressions. I stumbled and fumbled for most of the questions and probably sounded like an idiot answering them, lol. Fortunately, the gal I was having the interview with was quite empathetic and understanding and told me I answered her questions just fine. So now, I await another phone call to find out if I made it to the second interview or not.

I'll be leaving my digital printing job for either a customer rep job or administrative coordinator. I haven't been in customer service since the early 2000's. I'm hoping for the Admin Coord position because it won't directly involve customers and be more computer work and phone calls. The only aspect of the job I have zero experience with is MS Dynamics AX 2012. That's really the only part of the job that concerns me, but if I can learn to operate and maintain a quarter million-dollar printing press, I surely can learn some new software.

Felt like I needed to get that off my chest, lol!"
68,Any insight on being a demand planner?,jobs,"I have a math degree and supply chain background, looking for a new job with better pay, with better benefits, and that is fully remote.  The title that seems like the best fit for me is demand planner.

I don't want to travel and I don't want to deal with customers directly.  I'm not a negotiator and I'm not here to schmooze, wine and dine, etc.  I just want to be a numbers monkey in the background.

Is demand planner the right title for me?  I'm a month into my search and I have gotten multiple responses from applications, but none have fit my criteria for an interview.  A lot of listings mention travel or dealing with customers/negotiating deals.  Are there jobs out there that fit what I need or should I consider other titles?  Maybe I just haven't found the right match and need to keep looking?"
69,Need advice for switching jobs,jobs,"So I‚Äôve been in sales for a couple large companies for the last 7 years.

74,Can I negotiate pay after accepting over the phone?,jobs,"Went to an interview for an administrative assistant job 2 weeks ago and just got a call today offering me the job. I told them I wanted 10% of my current pay ($23.10) AND made the mistake of giving them the number $25.25 (Bad move). The HR lady countered by saying $20.30 over the phone which is still not a 10% raise of $23.10 and then I verbally accepted but told her to send me the offer by email. Is it too late negotiate after she sent me an offer letter. If I can‚Äôt ask for a raise can I ask for more vacation/sick days instead? They are offering me 10 vacation days and 6 personal/sick days annually. Other incentives are 3% company match 401k and Medical, dental, vision, life insurance. I don‚Äôt want to be greedy but the position pays up to $26/hr. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
75,Jobs that help people,jobs,"Hey everyone. I could use a little bit of insight about my situation. For a little bit of background I‚Äôm 23. Do not have a college education, and have been living on my own my whole adulthood. I have been in construction/telecommunications for the last 3 years. 

A few months ago I found a new job that‚Äôs paid pretty well given my experience level and things were going great at first. Everyone seemed happier to be at this company compared to others that I‚Äôve worked at, the benefits are good and I‚Äôm learning a lot about my trade. Until recently they started scheduling me for overnights, which I was very upfront about my schedule not allowing me to work night due to family and other personal reasons. I‚Äôve been working nights for about a month now and there‚Äôs no end in sight. I‚Äôve tried to talk to my operations manager about it several times but he keeps saying there‚Äôs nothing he can do. 

This has prompted me to start looking for another job. I don‚Äôt want to keep jumping around different companies but I‚Äôm just not happy with what I‚Äôm doing. A friend of mine asked me when this started what my professional goals are and it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about. My girlfriend recently started working for an in home nursing company as a coordinator and she loves it. Every day I hear about how accomplished she feels knowing she did a service for people and her day at work helped improve peoples lives. That‚Äôs what I want. I‚Äôve always wanted to be in a profession where I could take pride in the fact that my work was helping other people. 

That being said I don‚Äôt have a college education and don‚Äôt have the means to go back to school. I‚Äôm strongly considering applying for a job at her company because I know several people who work there already and they don‚Äôt mind if you don‚Äôt have a degree, but I‚Äôm also looking into other options. 

While money is necessary it is somewhat secondary. As long as I can pay my bills, put food on my table and live comfortably I‚Äôm good. 

TLDR: what are some jobs that allow you to put some good out into the world and help other people  that don‚Äôt require a college education?"

78,Does it look responsible to ask new employer for transition time for the sake of old employer?,jobs,"It seems at first like jumping in immediately to a new position is the way to go, to be respectful. But if I told a new employer that I would like a month to transition away from the old employer so I don't leave them high and dry, does that look good and responsible to the new employer, or just annoying?"
79,I feel like I will never find a job matching my current salary?,jobs,"I wasn't sure how to word my question, but I feel like my current job's salary is so high that no other job that matches my current experience could match or surpass that.

I'm actively looking for a new job since my current job is very toxic. My boss was really good at first, but then I saw his true colors as a manipulator and a micro-manager. He shifts a majority of his work to me while he watches videos on his phone and comes in late and leaves early. Also, the people I work with aren't the best. I've voiced my concerns and that I feel overwhelmed with my work, but no success. So, just having a new environment would be added value for me.

I've been applying for jobs as a Project Manager since that's a field I want to pivot to. I currently work as an Operations Manager, but I have project management experience and even have a certification. However, the recruiters' salary expectations are always lower than mine. Even matching where I'm currently at is the higher-end or above their budgeted range. The recruiters' answers always make me feel like my job is ""overpaying"" me for my experience, for a lack of a better phrase.  I have 6 years total working experience, but I progressed to a manager of my department after finishing my company's year-long management training program. I have been in my current manager position for 3 years now. I feel like I need to have more years experience to match the salary I currently have in another organization, but I feel like it will come down to if I want a lower salary for a better work environment."

81,My wife's employer is hinting at laying her off a few weeks before she goes on maternity leave,jobs,"Located in the US. 

Back in August my wife's boss changed her position to a remote position to support our move out of state. Now that we've moved her boss is telling her he's being pressured to move her position to on-site only, and on top of that the company isn't sure if they're going to continue supporting remote work from the state we now live in.

They've already approved her company paid maternity leave (4 weeks fully paid by employer + 6 weeks at 60% pay via short term disability) which is scheduled to begin in just a few weeks.

She met with HR and was told that she isn't being let go, but the company reserves the right to alter job descriptions/locations as they see fit, and they're ""in the process"" of making the change to her current position with no defined timeline as of now. She was told she'll remain in her current position as long as she accepts the new requirement of being on-site. We aren't willing to move back to the state we just left for her job. To me this sounds like they're preparing to pressure her into quitting.

I work as a Program Manager at a large non-profit healthcare system. I am the first PM for my department and worked pretty independently with the support of my boss (Executive Director). I have worked there for 9 months. 

Recently, the VP brought in a guy for an internship that I later found out he is acquaintances with. I managed his entire internship and organized everything. I was brought into my boss's office and was told that they want to create a position for him (Project Coordinator) and that I would be his manager. I had no opportunity to interview other candidates for the position. (Yes, I could have objected but I was fearful of leaving a bad impression with the VP).

They end up hiring him, and when I work with him I realized he will require A LOT of coaching. Even on simple things like writing emails. I currently have my normal work AND manage him, and was **never offered a raise or title change.** 

When I accepted the role prior to being a manager, I negotiated a 7K sign-on bonus with a salary of $105K (healthcare typically has less room for negotiations than fields like tech). **Should I re-negotiate even though I haven't been there a full year?**"

I‚Äôm really not sure what to do. I feel like I should stay where I‚Äôm at because I‚Äôm comfortable, but when I graduate with my social work degree and have no social work experience, I‚Äôm less likely to be hired. Any advice?"

87,"I‚Äôm a bartender looking to make a career shift into anything else. Looking for advice, insight, and guidance.",jobs,"This was crossposted in r/sales

Background: I live in a big, major city in the US and have been bartending for 10+ years. I‚Äôve worked for some of the best cocktail programs in the states and have really reached some of the highest heights within the hospitality industry. Though I have degrees, I chose bartending because I loved the social aspect and building cocktails allowed me to have a creative outlet while I was figuring out what to do career wise. I recently turned 35, and am now getting to the point in my life where I wake up, stretch, and throw my back out. It‚Äôs great lol. 

2020 really shattered my industry and showed how terrifyingly easy it could break. Between me aging and this, plus the bartending industry being notorious for not extending benefits, insurances, retirement, etc‚Ä¶I made a decision last year to really focus my efforts during unemployment to finding a new career that allowed me basic benefits that most people consider the bare minimum. I realize bartending isn‚Äôt something my body or mind can do long term. I‚Äôll throw in that I‚Äôve always felt like people treat people in hospitality as lesser than, and as a Korean, the amount of racism I experienced the last couple years really turned me off to ever wanting to work as a front facing employee. Though I‚Äôm extremely good at my job and am super well connected, it wasn‚Äôt enough to get me to consider staying in the industry, though I received many many offers when I quit my last bartending gig. 

Recently, I started throwing out applications and got a job offer as an ‚Äúaccount executive‚Äù, which, based on what my friends have told me, is more/less a cold calling, hustle/selling of restaurant and other small business POS systems. It‚Äôs an average salary (from what I‚Äôve gathered via Glassdoor etc‚Ä¶) in my area, with the bulk of my income contingent on commission and bonuses. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm here to ask y‚Äôall for any advice and insight on what it‚Äôs like to work a position like this. Good or bad, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The more honest and transparent, the better. My concern is that I left bartending due to the stressors, and without a ton of experience in sales, I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm walking into a position where they‚Äôll transfer over. I‚Äôm familiar enough to know sales is super competitive and, in a city as big as the one I‚Äôm in, it can be cut throat. Your insight will help guide me to whether or not I think the new role is something I could do successfully, or if I should continue job searching. 

Transparency: this is the first job offer outside of the bar industry I‚Äôve received, and I wasn‚Äôt trying super hard to search for jobs. I‚Äôm sure the majority of responses based off just this sentence will be ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take the first job offer!‚Äù, which is totally reasonable. Even if I decide to NOT take this position, the insight you give may help me alter my job search, or maybe I‚Äôll like what you say and I‚Äôll continue my search in sales related jobs!"

Does anyone have experience with this? Is that target salary of ""x"" the lowest end of the range the employer would pay, the highest end of the range, or somewhere in the middle? I'm not too bad at negotiating salary, so would asking for x+10% be appropriate, or is there leeway to ask for more if that ""x"" is at the lowest end of the range? I just can't think that a potential employer would give a target salary that is the highest, or even the middle, of what they would be prepared to pay, but this is my first experience with seeing a target salary in a job posting.

93,Medical sales background but need a job more education oriented,jobs,"Hi all - I'm so ready to quit my job but I don't know what I'd be a good fit for otherwise. I have ~10 years in medical sales in various types of positions. At my current job, my responsibilities started out as more ""educating"" oriented; basically I sought out clinical groups and was responsible for teaching them about the product we had and then working with clinicians when they sent in a patient referral to get them this product through medicare. I loved it and was good at it because it involved problem solving on behalf of the patient and their health, and the in-services I gave were the highlight of my day. I'm a great public speaker and educator, I'm great at being an expert in one or a few devices, but I am NOT great at what the company has evolved my job into. Now it's over the phone cold calling for hard to find leads (which is typical sales I guess)... but there are no more in-services, no more patient interaction, and way too many new products to keep up with. I feel overwhelmed and sent in a million directions. My original product is being phased out. On top of that, our commission reports and sales reports are constantly incorrect, the sales cycles are longer so I'm getting less commission with no salary increase, and I feel like I have a new report to fill out every day. The stress is just not worth what I'm getting paid. 


I'd love some guidance as to what kind of role I could pursue otherwise with my background. I'm assuming clinical educator would be a great fit but I'm not a nurse and have no interest in going to nursing school. I'm an artist as well, although I don't know how medical sales and art could meet, lol. Any advice welcome."

I was very lucky because I talked to a store manager who was pretty clueless about repair in general.

A week later I get a call asking for an informal interview and then a week after I was told that I got the job. Based on what I read from the posting, I thought I was going to hardcore wing whatever was needed for me, but turns out that training pretty much covers all experience levels.  


I look at other indeed postings and I wonder if these jobs asking for years of experience really require that. I thought entering the repair field was be a giant hurdle because I didn't have any real official experience besides some college schooling and maybe an attempt at a hobby years ago.

*Should I expect my unused PTO to be paid out when I leave? Or should I try to use some of it up before giving notice? New start date isn't for over a month so there is a lot of time in between.

*Do I need to write a resignation letter? I have a good relationship with my manager so unsure if I just confront them or if I do need to write something up.

*401k: will this be handled between both my current and soon to be HR departments to transfer things over accordingly, or do I need to have this handled myself?

I gave a month plus one week of notice as there as some I need to see through before I leave and I am very aware of the hiring market right now. I did not want to leave them in a bad place and needing help.

To my point: My hiring anniversary is the month of August but my vacation time (no sick leave or personal days at this company) is always given in the first few weeks of January and MUST be used by end of the year, they do not roll over. Having given my notice in the second week of January, my last day will be February 11th.

I received a response saying ""Money is tight right now, we can offer you a paid day off for the day of the surgery only.""

First of all, it's on a Wednesday and I don't see myself being back to work the next day. 

Second of all, I have earned this vacation time and do not see how it can be taken away because of either money being tight or the fact that I have given my notice.

NEED YOUR ADVICE! Not sure this is the right group to post (please let me know). I have been working in tech field for almost 8 years and was never actually happy. For 6 years, I worked in higher education making 5-figure salary and thought salary is the reason for my unhappiness. Now I shifted to another similar role making low 6-figures and still feel same misery at work. Now, I understand that I don‚Äôt like working in tech because of coding and constantly learning new tools. I feel like every year or so, I am learning a new tool or technology as things are constantly changing. I thrive more in stable environments based on my personality. I am willing to learn new things but these tech tools are draining me but not motivating me to learn.

To be short, I am thinking about roles like HR generalist (or) Diversity and Inclusion Manager. Not sure, how good these roles are with regards to pay, work-life-balance and growth. Also, do you have any other non-technical role suggestions that I can transition into as I already have experience in tech roles? I have looked into Product Manager role videos on YouTube, didn‚Äôt seem like a good fit to me.

Most people I've spoken to have told me to stay away from non-profits. They all say that they're all the same no matter the industry, and that I'll be just as burnt out at any non-profit as I am right now. With that said, I wanted to get some other opinions on this matter."

Receptionist sounds incredibly basic because I do a LOT more than answer the phone and schedule. I fix any and all computer/tech issues, inventory/ordering, payroll, etc. So I will make sure I include those things. (I'm applying for a remote customer service/call center type position that only requires experience that I do feel that I have from my current job.) But I've been there for 9 years. I just turned 29. I have worked since I was 14 years old. The jobs prior to my current position are typical high school/early college student jobs, however. First job from 14-18 years old was at a local ice cream shop. Then a job at a retail store called Charming Charlie. Then a job at Panera for a short time. And then my current job of 9 years.

My question is, do I bother to include those earlier 3 jobs on my resume under work experience? Or do I just include my current job of 9 years? I feel like including them shows that I have worked, consistently, since I've been old enough to do so. But will I be taken less seriously for putting my high school ice cream shop job on my resume? 

Also, if I don't have a degree, should I still include my college education on my resume? I have a decent amount of credit hours completed, a medical terminology class completed with an A grade (medical terminology knowledge is a plus for the position I'm applying for), and a very good overall GPA for what I have completed. Can I/should I include this on my resume despite not finishing yet or having a degree?

I have years of volunteer experience as well, but it was during high school. Include this? Or leave it out?

Thank you in advance. This probably sounds silly, but I genuinely don't know how to go about this after being at the same job for 9 years, and at a much different place in life than I was at 20."

I  applied for over 200 jobs and had about 6 interviews in this period, but ended up getting a temp job at a covid test centre for a few months, and then this admin one which is now coming to an end, and again, I am having to apply for jobs. 

It is so depressing that I just can't get a nice, permanent  job that I don't dread going to everyday. I didn't go to university as I didn't know what to do, and everyone told me to just do an apprenticeship because it will open doors- well it hasn't because I still get rejected for even jobs at McDonalds. This dull job I am working in is in the design industry, but there is no chance of actually doing a design job because they recruit only top graduates from all over the country. 

My boss offered to review my portfolio of work which I do in my spare time, and instead of critiquing the layout or suggesting things to add she basically tore the whole thing apart and sent an email after saying ""forgot to say, you have some really nice work"" so that was just, super depressing. She criticised my photography and the colours I use in my artwork, as if I can go back and change something like that. I have always struggled with confidence, but after the past 2 years of putting time into my art again, I did three really successful craft fairs, a few commission pieces and I was chosen to be part of a public art exhibition. I was starting to feel confident and she has unknowingly destroyed it with one email. 

I feel so unmotivated to go through this job application process again, I have had one interview so far this year but I messed it up hugely because my laptop let me down, I couldn't get into the MS teams call, and I had to call the head office to try and speak to the interviewer and we missed 15 mins of the interview time. She only asked me 2 questions and I didn't get much of a chance to sell myself. I apologised profusely and she was like ""don't worry, it happens"" but it wasn't a good first impression. I really wanted that job. 

All I am qualified to do is Admin, and it bores me to tears. I don't want to do it anymore."

Regardless, my boss is asking me to come in today and to ‚Äúignore the email from HR‚Äù even tho it states very clearly that failure to comply with their COVID safety instructions will result in corrective action and possibly termination.

I understand a job right now is a blessing, even if it is underpaying. Tbh, my happiness has been sapped up. I also find myself getting frustrated by the lack of good pay.   


I'm mainly only passionate about creative things/using my creativity. That severely limits my options, yeah?

Are there associates degrees that can get me a job immediately? I'm technically an adult but I honestly feel so much like a lost child with poor decision making. I don't know where to start"

205,no PTO pay out,jobs,"I started a new job in fall 2020 to fill in a major position. A year in I decided the role wasn't for me and tried to leave, they pleaded with me to stay and convinced me to stay. A couple months and some therapy sessions later and I still wanted to leave. Before I tried to quit the first time, in August, I had asked for more PTO. They said yes and then went on to not give me any more until January. I worked weekends and holidays for this job and had 50% of the PTO coming from my previous job. Anyways, I put my 2 weeks in at the beginning of January and had banked a year of PTO.

Legally they owe me the PTO and didn't pay it. I get it'd annoying I quit right after January but I had tried to quit months prior and was convinced to stay. I felt my PTO was terrible anyways and just feel the pto I had was overdue anyways. They know I feel guilty over leaving and I'm sure assume I won't say anything.

Would you ask? Idk what to do."
206,How can I game my bonuses to my benefit?,jobs,"I've been job hunting since early november months and landed offers today. This was much faster than I anticipated. Looking for thoughts and advice on bonus.


I get an annual bonus paid around March 15th, for results in 2021, but I must be employed on the pay date to get it. I have 13 days of PTO, which doesn't pay out when I resign. I wanted to give at least 3 weeks notice. My company (huge insurance conpany)and manager are both great.


I just came back from a week long vacation, and workload for the foreseeable future is very light at my current job. Perhaps 10 hours of real work per week.



My offers want me to start Feb 8th. Regardless what I ultimately do, I will likely overlap jobs for a bit because of the PTO policy. They also have sign on bonuses of about the same as what the bonus payment would be. 




I want to land both the sign on bonus and my company's bonus. My initial thought is that I could work until Feb 8th as normal, then take liberal PTO, maybe 2-3 days a week, and work both jobs until the bonus pays out 5 weeks later. Immediately afterwards, id give 3 weeks notice and coast. 


I don't think my company would fire me early to prevent me from getting bonus if I gave my notice 2 weeks before the payout, but I don't want to risk that unless there's something legal that would protect me ( I don't think there is).


Any thoughts on how to best play this?"

209,Question About Salary Negotiation,jobs,"Hello all! I come with good news: after over 600 rejections (implicit or explicit) since September of last year, I have secured\* a job!  


I want to give as much detail as possible to help with the advice, but not so much that I can be identified or my future employer can pick me out from the crowd. 

# THE DETAILS:

* I graduated from college with a B.S in May 2021, and have been actively looking for work since September 2021.
* The job is a temporary position at a company with over 1000 employees globally. It is a position that requires a Bachelor's degree and experience with Microsoft Excel. 
* The job is temporary because whoever is hired will be learning from and covering for a leave period for a permanent employee. The estimate is about a year of work.
* The job pays 27.5 per hour, coming out to about $55,000 assuming 50 paid work weeks, is overtime non-exempt, and is benefits eligible.  
* I didn't apply for this position, I applied for another position in the company, and someone in HR reached out to me about being considered for this position. I've done 3 interviews for this role, one as a phone screen, another meeting the boss, and a third meeting the boss' boss and my potential new coworkers. 
* At every step, they told me the timeline for the interview process would take longer than it would. (In essence, they rushed me along through the interview process, either because they liked me or they were desperate for work). They say they want someone ASAP, and offered me the job the day of my final interview, hours after meeting with me by phone.

&amp;#x200B;

# THE QUESTION:

I told my good friend whose opinion I trust the news, and he told me to negotiate for a 5-10% for more than the offered salary. I told my parents, and they told me not to risk it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'm weighing in my mind:

* I gave a range of 40k-60k yearly salary when I was asked late in the interview process to 'officially' apply, a.k.a to fill out their application form on their website. 55k is in the higher part of that range, so they've given me what I've asked for basically.
* The average salary  for 1 year of experience in this field is 69k. 
* I am asking early on for 3 days of scheduled vacation time in May, which I need for a prior engagement. I feel this weakens my negotiating power. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really what it comes down to is grappling between two phrases I hear a lot:

1. ""Everything is negotiable""
2. Be ready to walk away at the negotiating table.

I really want this job, but I also don't want to leave value on the table. Is it advisable to ask for both the 3 days of vacation in May, but also to counter with a 10% increase in salary?

(If you need any more details, feel free to ask!)"

217,How do I list dual-enrollment and unfinished degrees in job applications?,jobs,"Hi, everyone. I have a long, confusing situation I'd like to get help with.

I was enrolled in 2 community colleges at once and am currently taking a gap year. Since both colleges were in the same district and I was taking online classes, it made no practical difference from going to just one college. 

My original plan was to transfer the credits from one of the colleges to the other to get an AS in Computer Science, then to transfer to a four-year school to get a BS in Computer Science. However, since I recently moved, I'm now planning to transfer my credits from both of those community colleges to yet another community college, earn my AS in Computer Science degree there, and only then transfer to a four-year to get a BS in Computer Science.

 I have 3 questions:

1. How do I list the dual enrollment in job applications? Should I list both community colleges I attended, then list the AS in Computer Science degree under only one of those colleges? What should I put under the other college, when they ask for the degree I completed?
2. How do I convey that my degree is unfinished in job applications? It's easy to do when the job application lets you choose a graduation date that's in the future, but a lot of them don't, and some don't even ask you for your graduation date. I feel like, if I just select the degree I'm planning to get under the college I'm attending, it will come off as though I already have a degree. 
3. Furthermore, if I even should list my intended degree, I don't know if I should only list the AS in Computer Science degree I intend to get at one of the current community colleges I'm attending, or if I should list the BS in Computer Science degree that I plan to eventually get once I transfer to a four-year.

1. I'm  doing a remote (unpaid) internship and I've started since December 2020  (per contract). I'm thinking of ending it by the end of January, which  I'll have to ask if it's possible since having meetings at 1 AM  (Philippine time) just to do it at 5 PM (London time) is not doing me  any favors. I've written a few reports though, but I'm not sure on how  to explain it somewhere else as I'm considering not to put this in my  resume due to the time (eg I've worked for one month).
2. I've  started working professionallys since 2016. I was told that I may need  to remove some jobs in my resume (paper/Linkedin) just to trim it. If  this needs to be done, should I remove jobs that I've done in the last 5  years or so for example?

Wanted to get some opinions on this.

I'm mid career and have had 4 jobs. One for 2 years, one for 6 months, one for 4 years, and my current one for \~1.5 years.

I've received an offer to join a big bank (think Goldman Sachs, Bank of America) on the software side of things. The job that I had for 6 months was completely irrelevant to this new opportunity - no transferrable skillset, just something I wanted to try after college when I was still ""exploring"" myself, and I had no room on my resume (1 pager) if I included this.

I excluded this short 6 mo stint from my resume, and didn't talk about it during any of the interviews.

I will be starting the background check soon and understand that it's probably best to put this job on the background check app, but I didn't put it on the job application on the bank's website.

My question - should I go ahead and list it on the background check? My knowledge is that this is done by a third party (first advantage I believe). Do note that the other jobs have 100% the right start/end dates, I just basically left a gap on the company website job application because I had no space on my resume to talk about it plus my other jobs.

Thoughts?"

256,New management job - how best to change team schedules,jobs,"Hi!  I'm a new manager coming into a team at a company that works 7 days/week.  Fri-Sun are the busiest days for revenue.  

The current team lead has been there for many years, and for the last few has had Sat-Sun off.  Due to the size of the team and nature of the business, we cannot both have this schedule.  They have asked if I will take a split weekend (like Sun-Mon), while they have Sat-Sun off.  I have been approved by higher ups to give myself whatever schedule I want.  Also, all other managers work M-F.  I am not willing to work a split schedule while leaving them with Sat/Sun off, and professionally Sat/Sun off makes more sense for the things I will need to be available for logistically with other departments.

What is the best way to move their schedule or tell them this is happening?"

There are companies who look up for worker, but then never reply ever again, those who (usually big companies) make you compile endlessly stupid quizes and datas forms for apparently no reason (but I'm pretty sure that they do collect data, that later will either use or sell), and various sorts of scam 

Then there might be few companies who are legitly looking for people, but they don't have much of visibility because they are needle in a haystack or do quickly get saturated by the mole of requests

Then if you physically go to places, nobody wants anything, or if they want, they basically want a slave, or require various sort of certifications or degrees even for monkeys jobs like working at a McDonald's

Probably that's because of both social reasons and legal ones, some dudes who don't like competition, do push for politics that do stall or kill competition, like getting a certificate that will cost X money, and X time"

I successfully argued (so far at least) in my application that I could fulfil the role on a part time basis, as I am over-qualified for the role.

My worry is that they will want to pay me pro rata, however this would be too low for me to consider the role.

My main argument (currently) will be whether they expect half the output if I was to only work half the time, or if they actually expect me to do the same job in half the time (which I believe I am capable of).  

I expect them to want the same output, so I only think it is fair that I am paid the same rate.

Anyway the fella that called me informed me that there would be a group zoom meeting with the CEO tonight that all applicants will be attending (from what I can see on LinkedIn there's 7 of us). To be honest group zoom interviews seem super dumb and sorta sketchy. That along with the three different two letter names that's been presented I feel as if it's a scam.

263,Should I leave my stable corporate marketing job to work for a start up?,jobs,"I am located in Canada and have absolutely no experience or knowledge regarding employment within startup companies so I'm looking to gain some insight.

I'm 24 and currently work in Marketing for a stable corporation, been there for 8 months. The company is well-known and well-established and I love my role but I've realized that there are no opportunities for me in the near future to grow or advance. My manager is great and I've grown so much in my role, however my salary has been stagnant with no indication of growth either although I've taken more senior responsibilities.

My manager is extremely young and lacks overall work experience and more notably, management experience IMO so while they're great at their jobs, it's difficult for them to grasp certain things which makes my job more difficult. Right now, my breaking point is that we are soooo short-staffed but my manager is unable to recognize that our team is unable to take on more work and they are unable to put their foot down for our team. I am putting extra effort and hours into everything at work, yet my salary is only $50K and not to mention that I am bilingual in a mostly unilingual market. With the current job market, I've seen many entry level office and customer service English-speaking only role are paying around the $45-50K and I feel like I'm being underpaid for everything that I do. I have thought about asking for a raise, but I know that my manager would be unable to do much although they may support the idea of it as our Director would make the final call and I'm sure that they rely on a set budget which will barely even afford a $5K increase.

I am in the process of interviewing for a senior marketing role with a start-up company and would like to list out some pros and cons.

**CURRENT JOB:**

***Pros:***

* stable and autonomous
* I can manage my time however I like it for the most part
* good company and nice people
* nice and understanding manager
* I like my job

***Cons:***

* low pay
* no opportunities for growth/advancement unless my manager leaves
* no mention of performance bonus, yearly increases or anything like that
* not so great leadership from manager (no defined structure, processes, and they're just focused on the team being operational no matter how overwhelmed you might get)
* lots of extra work and responsibilities without getting nothing in return (not even paid for overtime or get time in lieu)
* constant structure and team changes

**PROSPECTIVE JOB:**

***Pros***:

* I would be moving to a senior role, this will set me up for the future as thereafter I will be able to taken on senior roles mostly anywhere. If I stay at my current company, I will have to gain at least 2-3 years of experience before acquiring a senior role outside of the company
* Better pay
* Start-up company so more chance to learn a lot and develop my skills

***Cons:***

* it's a start up, so I'm concerned about stability? (They have been running for about 5 years now and from what I saw, they have a $5M funding and about 35 people employed)

This is really my only major cons as I live alone and need a stable income. I've heard of having to put on a lot of extra hours, however, I really don't mind that and I really don't mind if I have to grind as I'm very career driven and feel like I'm young. I truly believe that if I get a senior role on my resume, it will open more doors for me to senior role in the future as right now, I'm only a coordinator title although I have senior responsibilities in my job and it will take me at least a few years to snatch a senior role outside of the company if I decide to leave.

Any thoughts?

264,Having a panic attack the night before job interview,jobs,"I have an all-day job interview scheduled for tomorrow morning. It requires a 30 minute presentation, and unfortunately the subject area they have requested is the lone area in which I don't feel confident in my skills. My presentation is not coming together at all and I find myself in a state of panic.

Oddly enough, I interviewed for a different position at this place and got the job. The interview for tomorrow is a higher position that they wanted to consider me for. I'm not sure if the subject matter of the presentation is the cause of my anxiety either. I just did a different all-day interview last week with a 15 minute presentation, and am still feeling the residual stress from it (it was my first all-day interview and presentation). My current job in itself has nearly been giving me panic attacks  this past week due to being overburdened from lack of staff. I also can't help but feel that given my comments in the past interview round that the presentation topic was chosen to hone in on my potential weaknesses, which also peaks my anxiety.

How should I handle this situation? I genuinely do not feel well enough or comfortable enough to present tomorrow. I could claim a power outage and reschedule, but part of me believes that I should go ahead and turn down this job as presentation they are asking from me is just too much for me at this moment in time. I'm not sure if a delay would make a difference."

I'm not sure I should have such a Tech focused resume when applying to jobs outside the field.

269,"Considering getting into office admin, would love some advice.",jobs,"Hello! I'm 25F, and am heavily considering trying to get into office admin-type work.

 Background:

I have been working mostly manual labour jobs my whole working life. Fast food, snow removal, horticulture, arborist assistant, landscaping. I love staying fit just by going to work, but I've been having the itch to at least try something else, see if that would suit me better. There are a lot of reasons; weather can be frustrating, labour jobs often have sexist and anti-safety cultures, and in the ones I have had there hasn't been any room for advancement / better pay opportunities. Just from quick searches, many admin assistant jobs (especially with certain ministries around me) pay better than any job I've ever had (though they are probably not entry-level).

I have a diploma in office administration that I got something like 5 years ago, when I was told it would be good for jobs. I never used it - it was a bad time in my life and I was not focused or motivated. Nowadays, I like clerical work and think I would be good at it; in my current role as a crew lead in a greenhouse, I do a fair amount of paperwork and using information software, and it's a nice break from sweating my butt off in semi-dangerous conditions covered head to toe in bugs. I am a quick and accurate typist (107wpm certified with over 95% accuracy), have excellent written communication, and love to organize and edit documents. I struggle at math beyond basics - not an algebra fan here.

I just don't really know what to expect from office admin roles. When I'm reading about positions available in my area, they have these huge, sprawling ""Duties &amp; Responsibilities"" sections. 

Are there roles where I won't have to be answering phones or dealing with angry customers? I've had many jobs where people will just verbally abuse you and I'm over it.  Will I be able to get entry-level positions that still pay better than minimum wage with a diploma but no real experience, or do I have to accept that I'll start from the absolute bottom rung of the pay ladder? Are there any really important skills/programs I should learn or brush up on before I start applying (like Excel) that could give me a leg up? Do you have any general advice for me? What has been your experience in office admin? Tell me your stories!

Side note, I've also read about positions within schools and universities, dealing with admissions or data entry. This environment interests me (despite the inevitable answering phones). How are those positions generally? 

I really appreciate the help! :)"

Now I‚Äôve worked with older people before with no problems but the people here make me feel like they are superior because they‚Äôve been here much longer than me. They always talk to me like I‚Äôm a kid. Also the job itself is not what I signed up for. At the interview she said its mainly computer/data entry work and going through bills but mainly its just a call center and I‚Äôm answering phones all day which I don‚Äôt like. 

I‚Äôm still fairly new so as a result I‚Äôm asking a lot of questions to answer the phones and everyone gets annoyed and tells me to ask someone else. I made a pros and cons list and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got so far.

Pros:
Flex time (I can come into work in any time between 7-9am)
Get to leave an hour early Fridays if I stay an extra 15 minutes Monday-Thursday
Most I‚Äôve been paid at a job before
Casual dress code

Cons:
Far drive from my house (45 minutes there and at least and 1 hour+ back home)
Spending more money on gas and tolls
No paid holidays (you have to use PTO to get paid and if you don‚Äôt have any its unpaid)
Entitled coworkers
Unrealistic work expectations
Hardly any free time due to commute and makes it hard to find time for school work

Should I stay longer and give it a chance or start looking for something else?"

283,Company offered me lateral job move - is it inappropriate to tell boss I only want a vertical promotion?,jobs,"I‚Äôve been working for my company for around a year and have received nothing but positive feedback. My bosses have consistently been telling me that they see me being ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù this year and that I am an excellent addition to the company

Recently, my boss calls me to tell me about an exciting opportunity for me at our company. He goes on to offer me a lateral position on his team for the exact same salary. I was a bit taken aback since when they have, on multiple occasions, talked to me about being promoted - I understood it as a vertical promotion to the next career grade. When I expressed this, my boss simply pivoted and said I would need to work for another year before being considered for a vertical promotion. 

I feel a bit blindsided and I don‚Äôt think I was unreasonable to think they were implying they wanted to vertically promote me in the past. Part of me feels they are struggling to fill the lateral position and want to push me into it to avoid having to train someone new. My current role is pretty ad-hoc and, given how quiet is has been recently, I don‚Äôt think it would be as difficult to train someone new on it. 

I am not at all interested in this lateral position but unsure of how to express this to my boss. I am confident in my abilities and my performance and do think I am worthy of a vertical promotion. Would it be inappropriate to just say that outright - that I am not interested in a lateral job change and only want to be promoted vertically? I am not sure if that outright honestly would translate well compared to just turning it down cause the role is not for me because of x y or z.

It really hurt because this is a company I‚Äôve really wanted to be with for a while. 

Things evened out with the family a few days later and suddenly I‚Äôm available to work the role again, but that ship had already sailed.

The worst part is I don't think I'm emotionally ready to get a job right now, but I have a couple months worth of savings at best. I was fired from my job for telling my manager to please respect me and give me some space.

316,Looking for tips: explaining upcoming school/field placement requirements to potential new managers,jobs,"I started a 3 year masters program that is being sponsored through my company‚Äôs tuition assistance program. Since my company is paying for it, they require managers to sign off that they agree to accommodate field placement requirements which might require weekdays, may or may not be during business hours, etc. Field is second and third year for 6-8 months, 16 hours a week. My hope is to get after business hours or weekend placement but nothing is guaranteed right now. First placement starts sometime this September.

My director signed off on my participation but since then my department has gotten a new manager and it‚Äôs been AWFUL. Our department is being run to the ground, turnover is crazy, morale is nonexistent, and a job I loved 3 years ago when I started has just become a pit of despair. I am miserable and looking for an out but I can‚Äôt leave the company since they‚Äôre paying my school.

I have had some AMAZING interviews in other departments, but the moment I mention my participation in the program and the possible field placement flexibility needed, interviewers will become disinterested and I haven‚Äôt gotten any call backs. 

Does any one have any tips or successfully switched jobs while in school? Sometimes I debate staying put but it‚Äôs just so bad. I got suspended without pay for 2 days because of an error on my managers part. 

Any advice, words of wisdom, or stories in solidarity are appreciated.

317,"Accepted a job offer, then approached for an interview with another company",jobs,"I took a job as a stop-gap measure a few months ago while looking for better employment. I continued applying for jobs in the meantime. In early December, I applied for a position (route sales, $45k salary, 50% travel) with a local company but didn't receive a request for an interview until 2 weeks later. I went, did the interview, felt like it went okay but not outstanding. Heard nothing from the hiring manager, and assumed I had been passed over for another candidate. Fine, no big deal. A week after the new year, he calls and offers me a job. I accepted the offer right away since I had nothing else pending. From there, it would be about 3 more weeks until I could make the full switchover. Well, in this time another company (large US corporation) which I had worked for previously calls me. They want me to interview with them for another job (field project manager, $50k+, closer to 80% travel), and I feel that the interview went pretty well.

My question is, with the original job I was offered starting in t-minus a week, and a potential job offer coming from this other company, how do I handle the situation? I feel like it is impossible for me to turn down the latter job as it pays better and the job title looks far better on my resum√®, but I also don't want to burn bridges with the company that already offered me a job. This is especially important because the first job is in an industry in which I have already built a professional network in recent years.

321,Wondering if I should hold on or try a quick exit,jobs,"Hi,

After 16 years at an old job (middle management/foreman type of job), I was semi actively browsing the job market in my area (heavy industrial ). I felt like I had did everything I could at this job and my motivation was dwindling.

I found a job in another related industrial type of business, but a step higher in the corporate ladder (upper management). This is a kind of job I would not have been able to get at my former place, so I was intrigued, sent my resume, nailed 3 interviews and finally  got the job at the end of summer.

The wage is quite similar to what I was doing before but the work is very tedious with 95% of my time spent at desk filling paperwork. This was not what it was supposed to be like at all when I got hired; I am all alone in this without any support. Everyone is remote with little help, sometimes only get an answer days later, got self-trained on my own and on call for emergencies basically 24/7 for all issues and work 70-80 hours per week to make ends meet.

I'm not sure if this is going to improve at all in the upcoming months but I feel I made a terrible mistake leaving my old job. I know at first this is normal to feel like this but after 5-6 months now I don't think this is going to be better, especially with the flurry of departures in the last few months and increase of work load. I am getting better everyday with what I was supposed to do at the beginning but something new gets added on the workload every week.

I only had 2 jobs from 1998 to 2021 but I feel this one is not a good fit for me after a few months. I know I was getting bored to death at my old place and this is the reason I started looking elsewhere. This is definitely a good challenge, serious organisation with ultra dedicated individuals. However, I noticed a steep degradation on my family life, increased use of alcohol, sleepless nights, weight gain and general mood decrease.

Should I try to hold on so this doesn't look bad on my resume or start looking now for something else? I know I'm a very hard worker, always getting stellar evaluations but this looks like another league for me.


TL;DR. Got a promising job ; turns out I'm responsible for everything like I'm the owner of the place and on call 24/7 with 70+ hours weeks. Personal life went down the drain. Not sure what to do with this at all."

326,6 months too early to ask for a raise?,jobs,"There's no formal raise structure per our employee handbook in a small startup.

They took a chance on me and started me off somewhat on the lower end of the range given my lack of experience. I negotiated during the initial offer but happen to be on the lower end.

After 6 months here, I've received a lot of praise and commendation that they're really glad to have me on the team. I work in IT and my team is slow on the responses so I've aimed to make myself the person to bridge that gap of IT with the rest of the org, even if I'm not the most technical person in my team, I strive to do projects that are new to all of us so I'm not playing catchup on the technical front but rather carve out a small niche for myself. 

I do have imposter syndromes at times but objectively I can see my numbers are better than others. Same thing in some previous roles.

That said, I would plan to ask for a raise on these grounds: 

* I have sped up our responses to the rest of the business significantly (probably can scrap up some reports to see how we met our SLAs)
* Took the main IT responsibility for some important projects to the business
* I always try to maximize efficiency with our vendor costs and infrastructure which saves us tens of thousands per month
* Job market is hot for my skills and I'm technically underpaid compared to the industry
* There's no uncertainty now, I've proven myself in the time that I've been here.

I have been considering this for the last 2 months and believe I would like to go back.    
   
Reasons:

An over 30% increase in pay.   
A more interesting role with good advancement.  
Better hours.   
Waived probation and immediate benefits.   
My old colleagues who I love.   

The role I am currently in is ok, it's a lot of driving and unpleasant interactions and working out in inclement weather. Not sure about advancent and I haven't been feeling very fufilled. My manager guy has been delegating to me, which is fine, but he provides little to no context for tasks (jusy forwarda me emails with no information) and it all feels a bit sink or swim.

If possible, could you address the following questions:

* Is there a reason for a full-time job to start as a contractor job besides a probationary period?
* 1099 employees usually supply their own equipment, e.g. a laptop. If you move on to becoming a W2 employee, does IT/supervisor/whomever then have any access or ownership over your laptop or the files within?
* How does the hierarchy work since the contractor, who starts as their own boss, subsequently transitions into a role where they have a designated supervisor within the company? 
* Assuming you are a compliant and competent employee, what steps do you take to ensure full-time employment following the contractor period? I am worried that there is no legal recourse for me if, for instance, they never intended on hiring a contractor full-time in the first place (i.e. they were just saying ""full time available"" in order to get 3 months of work out of someone without having to pay taxes for that person)."

345,I'm I being scammed for a job on LinkedIn?,jobs,"FYI, I've not applied for a job since 1999 - I've been self-employed since then. Business has slowed, my pivoting isn't working fast enough and so I need a job.

So I'm completely new to this world of applying for jobs online. I specifically want a WFM/remote job.

I [applied to a job](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2871761926/?refId=dc8d2d9d-1de1-4dbd-b954-e96f0fa1ceef) on LinkedIn. It was a fairly a fairly vague description. The job poster doesn't appear to work for the company. The linkedin info for this company says it's based in Toronto, Canada, but the company's website says it's based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

A couple of days later, I got an email from someone referring to this job, subject line of email is ""EMPLOYMENT"". The sender's email address is just a regular gmail, not from the company's domain. The sender also seems a tad rough on the English language, but not horrible. They have been vague on details and when I pressed them with specific questions about the job, they only answered some of them. They also spelled ""centered"" as ""centred"", further making me believe they are not from the US where the company is based. They said they were available anytime for an interview, which seemed suspect. So I offered a specific time, never heard back from them and that time came and went.

I had also sorted jobs on LinkedIn to only show temporary or part-time jobs but now the job poster is telling me it's a full-time job.

The final red flag is they told me to spend 5 minutes of my time and gave me a link to the company's website - the real company with their real website. It just feels like phishing. They have not given me an exact job title, so I can't sort through the company's job listings to find the job on their site.

I searched on this sub for this topic and some people have said that many companies use recruiters to post the job postings on LinkedIn. But the job poster seems based in the UK and has a history as a travel agent and says nothing about her being a job recruiter.

In any case, I'm not feeling it, too many red flags, but I'm curious if this is a known type of scam, is this common on LinkedIn? I'd really rather not be wasting a lot of time fending off fake jobs who are just trying to get my personal information."

‚Ä¢First thing I was asked after my first day was if I had fired anyone, referring to one of the current employees. Boss said how much they loved doing it. 

‚Ä¢After an incident where someone came into our shop and stole some tools, boss would recount on how he was going to ""beat the shit"" out of that person if they ever saw them around. 

‚Ä¢Adding to the theft incident, boss recounted a time when he beat up an employee after they were caught stealing money. Boss lured the employee to ""check something out"" in the back and proceeded to beat them around with a collapsible baton, and then handcuffed them to a pipe while police arrived.

‚Ä¢Fired an employee after they went to interview with a competing business. They called the business up and claimed they would offer the employee more money, when the employee came back they were fired. This was over a $2 hourly raise. Claims that someone who's ""loyal"" to the company wouldn't be doing something like this. 

‚Ä¢Fired another employee within the week after they ""talked back"". The employee was concerned over a job that was wearing out his personal tools. Boss claimed their contract stated to have their own tools on hand during the job.

I interviewed well, didn't get the job, but they told me they liked me so much that they basically invented another director level job suited just for me and my skills. Really exciting, right? Except the salary offered is 70k. 10k below even the bottom end of the range for the other job that is supposedly at the same level. 

Is it crazy for me to counter-offer with 95k - the middle of the range for the first job - given that this job didn‚Äôt even exist when I applied? 

Context is that I'm pretty meh about my current job but don't hate it and am making 68k here so 70k would not be too much of a bump. Also it seems weird to me to come in in a director position already knowing I'm being paid *well* below at least one of the other directors. However this job also does sound super exciting bc it's geared perfectly to my skills and interests and the title would be a step up regardless. 

Not sure what to do - I need to write an email with my counter-offer by tomorrow morning."

I've applied for a job in a small city nearby on Indeed, a company that sells X product, the position I'm applying for is an accounting position. T

hey have a website and social media profiles but I couldn't find anything such as reviews or ratings, but they are registered on OpenCorporates and the Secretary of State's website. 

In their website they list an address for the company but a quick Google Maps and street view search shows it is instead a house in a neighborhood, not an office. 

They recently sent me a Word doc asking my to print it out, fill it, scan it and resend it, and I'm being hesitant as it asks for my SSN, for which they say they need it for verification. Can the company being registered as an LLC be enough legitimacy, or should I tell them I'm not comfortable with this.

Welp as the title states.

Late November i quit my FT job (bookkeeping/staff accountant) for a Seasonal Tax season job

reasons were: at my old job, I felt as if I wasnt learning at all and that majority of the job was data entry , but more of a responsibility role rather than actually learning..

Came here and knew the job would be data entry but at the same time I knew i would learn the basics and knowledge of returns, etc...

Anyway fast-foward to today, from the start of December to now, weve been training for 3 days a week on a tax software called ultra tax...

and usally we go by initials on the program when we do our trainings,

for example mine is LA , the other trainee is LS..

there were times where i would click on LS training files. because as a person with ADHD, it helped me understand... Just didnt think I would get caught, well when i did get caught by the trainer last week he asked me, and I sincerely told him that it helped me understand my mistakes, and LS is a smart dude btw so i doubt he was doing things wrong... they said not to do it, and they gave me a warning last friday and i said okay.

the guy that trains us is horrible and cant explain good, as a person with ADHD, i had no other choice but to look at his file for better understandings and for muscle memory, rather than me asking the trainer for ""help"", doesnt even help just says try figuring it out. I had no other choice, but it was way better than me asking the trainee for help in terms of understandings.

Clocked in first thing in the morning, they called me in the conference room, trainer told direcotro of what i was doing and they just decided to fire me...And because of that, they just assumed they werent confident in me, there was nothing for me to argue on my end except for what I said..

proceeded to move on and left immediately.

Just know that an employer doesnt care about the employee, were just a number at the end of the day...

I even got this job through a friend that worked there, and now that it happened, its understood that an employer wont care if their employee recommended this job to me.. &lt;-- thats a reminder to those that feel like taking a that job because their friend recommended it to them and they feel like itll be more secure and safety net. turns out i was wrong..

well everybody has a turning point! this sure was mine, well I hate applying to jobs because it tooks me months to find a new job which wasnt even a FT postion either, just seasonal position thats how tough it is out there, well now it deffinitly motivated me to study for my CPA exam and before i wasnt studying actively or seriously, i hope this was the turning point for me to take my studying seriously.

375,Feeling completely hopeless in my role,jobs,"Hi all,

Just as some background, I work in a technical STEM advisor role for a tier 1 operations company.
I joined as a graduate in early 2019, was promoted to advisor-level role in early 2020 and havent moved since. 

I am younger than all of my team but after 3 years from joining, i'm now the longest serving member of my direct team (~10 people). The manager/team lead is a guy in his late 50s, mostly with consulting experience, and the rest of my team are mixed 30s-40s &amp; another ~50yo. 

Mid last year we had a restructure which promoted everyone in our team to a senior/specialist level role. I applied but was told that I didnt have enough years of experience and to try again in 2 years.

For the past 12 months, I've been under a senior who was very focused on his technical work and hence not interested in my personal development or support. As a result, I largely worked autonomously as the ""subject matter expert"" in the 2 major projects that im across despite having very limited experience. Although typically each discipline will have at least a senior/specialist/manager level rep to be responsible for these projects, my senior never showed up to any meetings nor made any meaningful contributions to the point where no one else in the project was even aware of him. I am the only non-senior/specialist/manager+ person representing a displine in these projects (20-30 people in each). 

These are both the upcoming critical projects for the business with several billion $$ value, although our specific discipline contribution isnt major.

End of last year, my senior left the business and left behind a few projects that he was working on as well. At the time, i approached my manager and asked to be given the opportunity to be acting senior, acknowledging I didnt have enough years of exp to properly fulfill the role. He initally gave me the impression that it was a good idea but this then changed to ""we'll have to see if this is even realistic"" (ie. not enough years exp) and then something like we wouldn't have capacity for me to act as senior due to no one else being able to do the actual work. I have seen several people with 2-4 years exp be given acting senior roles in a similar team so there is no real barrier, budget is also not a concern for us. Recruitment is very difficult for our discipline and its not likely we will have anyone new for the next 6+ months.

I do exactly the same work as every other (specialist/senior) person on my team, if not more due to having more tenure and general understanding of the business. They will often come to me with questions. I have great feedback from other teams and many strong relationships outside my team. My job description explicitly states advisor level is to support a senior/specialist but the whole of last year and moving into 2022, I've been mostly working alone and have been responsible for my own projects. I brought up that I havent had any developmental support for the past year and my manager sent me a 6-monthly catchup, I really wish that was a joke.

The real slap in the face was when my manager announced in our team meeting that I was (solo) taking on half the projects that my senior was working on, in addition to my existing work - without discussing with me first. This seemed like he wanted to put me on the spot infront of the team where I couldnt refute it. Again, I will be taking this all on alone as no one from my team has been put in to support me or replace my senior.  

I'm in shock, and also feeling very heartbroken as I have committed so much energy and effort in trying to deliver good outcomes for my existing projects. I have put my handup for so many other opportunities in the business (ie. STEM outreach, volunteering, training etc.) but everything I do is constantly brushed off by my manager. 

He does not think I have enough experience to be promoted or even temporarily but somehow im still capable of taking on immense responsibilities. 

I think the only way forward is to leave this team and apply for internal or external roles, i don't really know what else I can do. Could anyone provide any other advice or insights? 

I'm constantly baffled as to whether this behaviour by my manager is actually normal and a product of his consulting experience or actually as bad as I feel it is. How do I avoid this situation in the future?

Tldr; manager refuses to promote me despite doing exactly the same work as everyone else in the team. What are my options?"

I will wager that maybe 1% of people in the workforce have any idea of any metric in their job. Example from HR folks, ""I have lead teams, blah blah, and I lead to a quarterly increase of 25% in sales.""  


1. Like I said, few of us will have access to any sales data like this or any metrics from our roles. 
2. No way you could possibly, with any confidence, claim anything you did lead to X metric improvement. There are far too many variables in nearly any business that some low level manager or worse, a non-manager could point to with any degree of confidence to say their actions lead to X, Y, Z. It's absurd. 
3. I believe suggestions like this are, for the most part, a way for HR people to justify a lot of what they do and nothing more.

This question should legit just be- literally tell us a little about yourself. Besides very few of us having access to any real metrics, besides there being no way to say your actions lead to anything, this question, if answered in the manner above, tells you nothing about the candidate and any hiring manager with two brain cells knows that person is completely full of crap answering this to begin with. 

So, why do they keep asking it, and why do we keep letting HR people tell us that the question is a make or break and must be answered with metrics or else? I don't get it. Then again, I don't get why asking 10 HR professionals the same question will result in 9 completely different answers either, but that's a different story altogether."

My boss doesn‚Äôt listen to my needs, he doesn‚Äôt even care to find alternative solutions for the things i ask for that ‚Äúaren‚Äôt possible‚Äù, which is very demoralizing. I have other issues with this workplace, but I don‚Äôt want to go into detail. Besides not feeling respected, heard, or valued at my workplace, I‚Äôve started to resent the entire industry I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶ So basically, I hate my career. 

I never had much guidance about this stuff other than ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt go to college and get a job in your field, you‚Äôll never survive, AND you‚Äôll be a loser!‚Äù so i always assumed this was my only option, and that i‚Äôd be stuck for a couple more years‚Ä¶ I assumed if I got a ‚Äúregular‚Äù job (customer service, restaurant, etc.) that I‚Äôd be making way less money than I already do, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford my bills. Well, I did the math tonight, and turns out, I won‚Äôt be making SIGNIFICANTLY less if I get a job that pays minimum wage. I feel like i‚Äôve been scammed this whole time, I wish I had known sooner. I understand I could ask for a raise, but 1. my boss makes me feel intimidated to do so 2. i know they won‚Äôt give me a raise in addition to the yearly tiny raise.

I want to leave my current job ASAP‚Ä¶ I absolutely hate it, I‚Äôm incredibly unhappy, and the few extra bucks I earn now are not worth it at all. 

But as someone with basically no more experience‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure what all the ‚Äúperks‚Äù of working for a company vs. having a ‚Äúregular‚Äù job are. I understand some places don‚Äôt offer stuff like vacay days, sick days, benefits‚Ä¶ but if we put that aside, are there any advantages of working for a company like I have? is it a good idea for me to find a new job?

TLDR: idk if I should quit my miserable office company job for a regular job that pays only slightly less"
401,I am seeking advice on how to get a good job in my field fast after graduation (Marine Biology),jobs,"I'm a college sophomore at community College in Virginia (U.S.) I am on track to get my Associates of Science and transfer to UNC Wilmington and get my Bachelor's of Science in Marine Biology and Oceanography with a minor in photography since I will be photographing ocean creatures constantly. What can I do in my 3rd and 4th year of school to get a good job in my field when I graduate?


For me a good job of means: safe and healthy working conditions, decent benefits, hands on experience and decent pay 65,000-80,000 US dollars a year at least. I plan on getting field experience for a year and then getting my PhD. Can someone with experience in this field please give me some advice on how to get a good job quickly after graduating with my bachelor's?"
402,I want to ask for a 40% raise,jobs,"Hello,
I work in a STEM job. I was hired as a fresher 5 years ago. I have consistently been a top performer. I have always received positive feedback from my manager and also my skip-level manager throughout my tenure with the company. Last year, I accomplished a really important task for the company, because of which I‚Äôm pretty certain I will be getting promoted into a senior role soon. 

But what bothers me is my compensation. When I was initially hired as a fresher, I didn‚Äôt negotiate at all, which resulted in lower compensation. Back then, I was happy with my salary. However, I no longer feel the same. I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm grossly underpaid for my skills. Last year, I let my manager know I feel this way. He provided an annual raise of 8% which is pretty high compared to the 3% I was given until then. But even then, my salary is not up to the industry levels. I recently found out that a new hire is getting paid more than me, which completely broke me down. I work so hard and get so much done, I dont
 think this is fair. 

I want to proactively ask my manager to give me a 40% raise along with my promotion this year. That way, my salary will be on par with my peers at other companies.My company had high attrition last year, so they gave me a retention bonus of 10% which reaffirmed that they don‚Äôt want to lose me. 

Should I ask for the 40% hike along with my internal promotion? I don‚Äôt want to move to a new company, so that‚Äôs not an option. 

Please let me know if you think it‚Äôs ok to ask for a 40% raise."
403,Quit my job today because I didn‚Äôt like the vibe,jobs,"I put in my notice yesterday, but couldn‚Äôt bear to come in today so I just quit over the phone. It‚Äôs a weekend job- don‚Äôt worry I have a regular job on the weekdays that I am more excited to go to.

I was so excited to get another job; more experience, a backup plan, meeting new people, better pay. Working only on the weekends, a month in, it became the worst part of my week.

People were fairly nice, managers were a little too tense, and pushy with sale goals but I could handle it. I got Covid last week so I got a weekend off, coming back I just realized how unbearable it was to work there. 

Barely any employees and not enough to do. It was so slow, boring, and sad so I had to get out of there."
404,What can I expect when applying to a position I was previously declined for?,jobs,I applied and made it to the in person interview last September but unfortunately wasn't selected. I followed up with an email asking what I could do to improve my chances of getting the job and was told that they typically do not give advice like that but gave me a few things I could do to improve my chances. I believe I have a good chance of getting the position this time around but it really all depends on who else applies and what experience they have.

I‚Äôve applied to 80+ jobs since then. Only to get denied, or no replies every time. I‚Äôm starting to freak out since I‚Äôve been wanting to move states.

I‚Äôve been applying to the following roles logistics/supply chain analyst/specialist, pricing analyst/specialist and Financial analyst/specialist.

I am starting to feel demoralized that no one even wants to give me a chance. It seems like the job market is currently oversaturated. Everyone who is jumping ship and leaving their old jobs just gobble up all of the entry/Jr. level positions. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôve been feeling lost.

407,Unsure about job opportunity for ethical concerns,jobs,"A former manager just took on a new management position at a company and is forming a new team. He has asked me to apply as he knows my work and we work well together. I like him and know we would get along, and we would be working in an industry we are both familiar with (our previous work was consulting, but this would be a direct position).

My concern is that the company is a foreign bank. Specifically, they are headquartered in Bermuda. Bermuda is a tax haven country, similar to the well known Cayman Islands. This company was in the news fairly recently for having helped some people hide from US taxes.

I'm quite sure this sort of thing happens with a lot of banks. I expect the more well known banks are simply better at hiding it. But I can't shake an uneasy feeling about this.

To make matters worse, I absolutely hate my current job and really want out. So do I give up an opportunity to work with someone I know I get along with, doing work I know I can do, and get away from a position I hate all because I feel like there's a stigma attached to a particular country?

Where do you draw the line for places you are/are not willing to work?"

He is also doing petty things like making a camera point directly at the door so it‚Äôs the first thing I see when I walk in.,jobs,"It‚Äôs really starting to bother me and has been the reason for a lot of this bottled up anger. When I first started I did five off a bit of the wrong impression for I had legal issues and was on probation for a dui. They didn‚Äôt like me for it and they let me know. I was young tho (19) and it‚Äôs been 5 years. I bettered my life, have my on car, zero legal problems&amp; off probation yet my supervisor still demonizes me. I even found out he wanted me to quit at one point and tried telling me to do so indirectly. I was just too naive to see the signs. There will be times where he‚Äôll be nice and it will feel like he finally let the past go and accepts me but then he will dip back to being an asshole. I also have reason to assume he is miserable. He is 4‚Äô11 and literally (not even joking) has a beer belly that makes him look pregnant. I once told genuinely that him my weekend was ‚Äúsweet, but short‚Äù and I quickly saw in his face that it was a trigger word. His wife is also literally 500 pounds and we are all worried about her. She is forced to work remotely now because of her weight. Not even covid. She is also a supervisor and of value to this organization And she doesn‚Äôt hate me like her husband does by letting me know and I appreciate her for that. Anyhow, I always stay minding my own business and working hard but the gossip is catching up to me. I notice that he‚Äôs starting to ‚Äúset‚Äù me up trying to catch me off guard more than often now, and the people he talks about me to are subtly starting to ignore me. He‚Äôs been here 18 years, just got his bachelors through work tuition assistance program, and is of way more value than me to the company. I‚Äôm afraid to speaking to HR because I have a gut feeling the generalist will tell me ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù and ‚Äúdo what you gotta do.‚Äù She is like that but I totally understand and don‚Äôt blame her. She‚Äôs older and wiser so that kind of advice is sorta realistic and necessary to hear if I want to continue to grow up.

417,Negotiations and Interview Questions that are a Must,jobs,"I've had two jobs in the last year. Prior to that, I was at my company for four years, had a great mentorship in an incredibly successful business. I was proud of my work there, I felt confident in myself. But I was also highly underpaid. 

I left there last January for a $30k raise. The company was incredibly toxic. All but two people have quit within the opening of the new office within a year. I soon learned that money doesn't bring happiness. 

I left that job for a new position making $20k less, anticipating that the company was similar to my job I left that I loved. While the culture is very similar, they are incredibly unorganized, very old school, resistant to change, and have blocked several of my attempt to make things run more efficiently. That's what I was hired to do. 

I feel like I am working harder than I should be by their terrible processes, workflows, and am finding that the workload is overwhelming me. It's not even just the amount of work. It's that I feel I am not doing my best. I feel rushed the entire time I am there. 

I decided that after working the evenings and weekends to keep up, I am realizing that while I hate being a quitter, sometimes it's necessary. 

As I start looking for other employment, I have a few questions that some of you might be able to help with:
1. When interviewing, what are the best questions to ask to truly see if a role is a good fit? I want to avoid making the same mistakes I've made last year. 
2. When a company makes an offer to me, other than negotiating a base salary, what other benefits do you find companys will often negotiate on? 
-Can I negotiate that they pay a portion of my health insurance?
-Can I ask for a yearly bonus?
-Can I ask for a higher percentage match on my 401k?
-PTO/Vacation
-Company paid certifications within the first year of employment that pertains to my role 

While money always sounds great, I'm finding myself moving into a part of my life where my kids are heading off to college within the next year, and I want to travel, so PTO is valuable to me. 

I appreciate your help!"

I'm doing something a little different right now, a different kind of 'technician' role that I really don't like and want out of, would rather get back to just plain old electronics, but it seems like these days the only interest I get is from these skeezy 'staffing companies' offering skeezy 'contract work' where you're treated like scum.

Just THREE DAYS IN, they pulled me aside and laid me off because they had less money than they thought they did (yes really). Nothing to do with me.

As a result I was unemployed for a month before finding employment in a casual job, effectively in the position below my original job, at a different company. I‚Äôm still there now. 

I‚Äôm worried that as a result my resume looks terrible and like I not only got demoted but I‚Äôm also a flaky employee who leaves jobs quickly. I‚Äôm wondering whether I should put this unfortunate incident on my CV to try and buy back some credibility as I look for jobs now."

Now I can't justify to the higher-ups on why we would only hire someone to only do billing stuff (like invoicing) now.""

I felt like crap.

And I was handling some reconciliation thing too but then I wasn't sure how to do it, considering it's only my second time doing it. And then after the closing period, this task has been passed over to another person all because I was too slow at it. And my manager also told me ""This is the corporate world we're in. Time waits for no one. I suggest you better do some reading as your absorption level is too slow.""

A little background, I joined this company as an accounts receivable associate and tomorrow's gonna be exactly my third month here. And this is my 2nd time performing closing. I work overtime like most of the time, even when it's not closing. Is it normal? Is this what accountants do? I'm burnt out and have no work life balance.

Yeah so I went home and cried that day. I wanna leave this place so bad. Without a backup plan. And even though I've been unemployed for almost a year prior to getting this job due to COVID.

Is there anyone who dislike accounting but went into accounting because you're kinda forced to? Like I have a degree in accounting and this thing/job is the only thing I'm qualified for.

Please advice. Thank you in advance."

I usually never work without one and I acknowledge that mistake but I did the work and was in talks with the boss throughout. I had a company email and was included in the company drives. So I felt somewhat secure that I'm within the company already. 

I finished my contract work in a week, I was asked to do makeup work for someone else who was mia and I worked another week. Then everything was put on hold.

Holiday break came and went and I gave my boss the benefit of the doubt because he wasn't reaching out.
I then started to get worried because of the lack of response after new year holiday so I looked at the names of my coworkers on the list and found them on Facebook so I can ask for help.

The other 2 workers were given contracts so I realized that the boss really did forget to give me mine.

The issue now comes from the boss' lack of communication. We're asking when we'll recieve the payment now. We're each following up and his messages are days apart.

First he said this week, then he said this weekend. And now I see my messages arent being seen yet again and the weekend is just about over.

What gets to me is the boss' excuse. His silence during the holidays was ""sorry I've been sick"". Well. Okay. It takes 5 seconds to answer a text but let's say I accept his excuse. He's still been just as neglectful to respond. 

3 of us have to get our pay within the next few hours for it to still be weekend. How can we push for this?
Also, he found us on a local Facebook group for jobs. We want to give a warning to other locals to look out for this guy and his company but would we be likely to get sued? If we do in fact get our pay today, can we still go to that group and give a heads up or should the 3 of us move on?

TL;DR - I signed up for remote work and did 2 weeks. Boss rarely ever responds, and is very vague about details of when to expect pay. Keeps promising ""this week"" or ""this weekend"" but nothing to back it up. How do i get my money?"

I've set up a meeting with my manager tomorrow - how do I convey this in a graceful way? I wouldn't have left if he hadn't been so hot and cold with me and this is almost entirely his fault.

458,"First job, first day, advice please! (Landscape design)",jobs,"I just landed a seemingly sweet first part-time job as a Landscape Design Assistant at my favorite nursery (I am a huge plant lover). Owner who interviewed me seems very nice, and is basically tasking me to learn their new software on my own and be their digital guy, whereas they have only done designing with traditional media almost exclusively, as well as random stuff like clerical and occasional field work over at the nursery. At least that's what I gathered from the situation. It's a small office, there were only 2 other people there when I was interviewed but I believe there's another designer.

I have a background in art and horticulture (bonsai artist for 2 years), and I'm a junior Mechanical Engineering student. Artistic skill and good with computers was required. It was an unusual interview, started off like I had already got the job, explaining the job and talking most of the way though it with occasional questions and jokes. He had me play with his software alone for like 45 minutes, came back, and offered me the job! They had a lot of applicants too apparently, I think he liked me.

Anyway, I'm just looking for some advice on my first day. I'm pretty nervous, but less so because it seems like a comfortable environment. Lots of the advice I see about first days seems to be oriented to larger business/offices with many employees in your general vicinity and clear cut schedules, hierarchy, cubicles, kitchen etiquette, etc. Any advice tailored for a smaller, more ""awkward"" type company?

TL;DR: Got my first job as a landscape design assistant, first day tomorrow. Smaller company/office, day-to-day a bit vague, any advice?"
459,"First job, first day at work, advice please!",jobs,"I just landed a seemingly sweet first part-time job as a Landscape Design Assistant at my favorite nursery (I am a huge plant lover). Owner who interviewed me seems very nice, and is basically tasking me to learn their new software on my own and be their digital guy, whereas they have only done designing with traditional media almost exclusively, as well as random stuff like clerical and occasional field work over at the nursery. At least that's what I gathered from the situation. It's a small office, there were only 2 other people there when I was interviewed but I believe there's another designer.

I have a background in art and horticulture (bonsai artist for 2 years), and I'm a junior Mechanical Engineering student. It was an unusual interview, started off like I had already got the job, explaining the job and talking most of the way though it with occasional questions and jokes. He had me play with his software alone for like 45 minutes, came back, and offered me the job!

Anyway, I'm just looking for some advice on my first day. I'm pretty nervous, but less so because it seems like a comfortable environment. Lots of the advice I see about first days seems to be oriented to larger business/offices with many employees in your general vicinity and clear cut schedules, hierarchy, cubicles, kitchen etiquette, etc. Any advice tailored for a smaller, more ""awkward"" type company? Or better yet, advice about this particular job?

I'm currently doing a Bachelor's degree in international relations at a mediocre university in Central Europe. Apart from my studies, I also work remotely full-time at the USA-based company as a marketing copywriter, making a decent amount of money, having a flexible schedule. However, I'm honestly fed up with this job. Marketing has never been my thing, and I got this position by an accident. I'm passionate about politics and international relations (IR), and this is where I see myself in the future. I am currently considering leaving this company and look for something else that would be closely related to IR. Specifically, I want to work at a think-tank or a policy consulting firm.

My first question is: should I look for a full-time job immediately, or having an internship in the sphere first is a must?
Second question: what are the chances of me getting an offer from such well-known organizations as the Brookings Institution, or the Council of Foreign Affairs?

Finally, is there anyone here with experience in working at any of such respectable think-tanks?

465,"Setting boundaries with an anxious &amp; ""spiritual"" boss",jobs,"Hi y'all,

I'll start off by saying that I really don't want to find a new job. My resume is a mess with trying to navigate post-graduation life in a pandemic plus living in a tourist city where professional work is near impossible to find... I just am not in a space where I want to find a new job. Plus, I do really enjoy my day to day tasks and the industry as a whole. But my increasingly chaotic manager is messing with my brain. She has said multiple times that she has anxiety.

I really don't mean to project or sound ableist, but her mental reactivity/mood swings seem to be quite rough and deteriorating by the week, and she copes by using law of attraction and crystals which leads to a lot of spiritual bypassing of work issues. She will suggest that I manifest more sales so I can get a raise in accordance with my recent promotion. She credits any business success to how much she's been meditating lately. But she is not zen. For example, she has news notifications on her desktop computer and phone for some reason. Several times a day, she will scream ""Oh my god"" ""What the f\*ck"" ""holy sh\*t"" etc into our workplace and then describe whatever headline came up and her thoughts on it. From Covid vaccine dangers to Free Britney, she monologues how hopeless and worried she feels at full volume all day. It's quite triggering and distracting.

She is also very reactive and defensive when issues are brought up. For example, a coworker's three year old runs around our workplace every day. Last week, the three year old tried to push me off a ladder. When I told my boss, she said to consider it my free birth control because ""kids are nonstop."" 

These problems have increased dramatically over the past month, related to how much more she's been coming into work since we're training new people. I'm hoping I'll see less of her soon, since it is SO MUCH calmer around work when she's not around. I try to look after my mental health, but dealing with her full-volume anxiety spirals as I go about my day is wrecking me. I've started feeling really resentful. I just don't know if I should try to ask her to be more private with her thoughts, set some kind of boundaries, wear earbuds all day, or just manifest a calmer boss LOL."

467,Job seems to be treating me unfairly but I feel I have no right to vent,jobs,"I (21f) have been working here 5 months. My other co workers have been there a year or longer, (this is important). 

My gm isn‚Äôt in very often maybe twice a week in person because he can WFH. My manager is in almost everyday I‚Äôm in. But only for a 3-4 hours sometimes 2 at a time. He has 2-3 days off a week.

I have 4 shifts a week usually that are 8 hours and it‚Äôs always AM. When I started I noticed a trend of my PM relief showing up 5-30 minutes late literally every shift I was scheduled. I didn‚Äôt write down the actual time because a time I was 2 minutes late my manager informed me not to do that. So with her, unless it was 30-60 minutes late I didn‚Äôt write the actual time. 

So, because of this I started naively thinking it was a grace period or that management did not care unless it affected THEM. So when my boyfriend who is my ride found out this, he didn‚Äôt mind dropping me off 5 minutes late. 

I did, but he didn‚Äôt think there were consequences and I didn‚Äôt really either. But I still didn‚Äôt like being late. Anyway, I‚Äôd say for the first 2 months I was good. But this month I‚Äôve had issues with my boyfriend and he‚Äôs become super unreliable. What was 5 minutes late here and there turned into 10-15 minutes late like two out of my four shifts.

I hated it! But i genuinely didn‚Äôt know how to navigate this correctly at first because he always told me ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be late I‚Äôm sorry, blah‚Äù. I don‚Äôt blame him. I could‚Äôve done taxis. In the moment the choice between a stranger and someone im comfortable, I chose the one I was comfortable. 

But again, My PM relief is still showing up 10-30 minutes late consistently. However it started becoming an issue when my manager would send pissed off texts to the person I had to relieve because he might‚Äôve had to come in if I didn‚Äôt show. 

I brushed it off as people are free to vent. But I thought it was rude and so did my co worker receiving the messages. 

Anywho, today my boyfriends car wasn‚Äôt starting so I messaged my relief and general manager right away. I gave a 30 minute time.

But it ended up taking an hour, I tried to get an Uber none were available. And taxis need a little more of a notice, I guess they were busy today. 

But I make it in. And my relief who isn‚Äôt mad at all as they only work 2-3 days a week and like the extra hour, was worried. I could tell on their face. He told me ‚Äújust letting you know you need to prepare to get yelled at.‚Äù I ask him why? And he said ‚Äúyou have to look at what (insert managers name) said about you.‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want go through the messages and to just read it aloud to me. 

It said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way since (insert my name) can‚Äôt show up on time, answer her phone, or ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù (I forgot what it said‚Äù EVER!!!!‚Äù 

I was a bit taken back and so was he. He felt uncomfortable getting this. I understand saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way, *blank* won‚Äôt be making it most likely‚Äù and I get he has a right to privately vent.

But to his team he manages? Not his management or friends or family? It seems unprofessional. I take full responsibility for how fucking annoying it must be. But he was supposed to show up today anyway, and when got here about 30 minutes after me he left in two hours.

It doesn‚Äôt annoy me that he‚Äôs upset, it annoys me that he doesn‚Äôt treat my other co workers we the same. It‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt affect him since there‚Äôs always my one co worker who i love that ALWAYS covers for the PM shift. So hes never had to go out of his way when she‚Äôs late or calls in on short notice. They always abuse my friends kindness and even put her ‚Äúon call‚Äù on days they think the pm shift will call out.

It‚Äôs frustrating that he only gets mad when people are late when it affects his schedule, not because it makes them seem un reliable. If so, I would be receiving these kind of texts every time the pm shift shows up super late. 

But I NEVER get texts from management asking ‚Äúwhen is *blank* gonna be there?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy are you still there, where‚Äôs *blank*‚Äù? 

I know she probably tells them, but so do I! Starting now I‚Äôm taking full responsibility and not relying on anyone for rides but myself and will schedule in advance. 

But it feels like I have no room to be upset because I was late. I want to address this with my gm but I don‚Äôt know what to say. Or how to word it. Because I still was late at the end of the day. 


TL:DR- my manager gets mad at me to the point of talking crap to my co worker when I‚Äôve been late, but doesn‚Äôt do this with my other co worker who is just as late as me. It reached a breaking point today. And I don‚Äôt know how to handle or confront this."

472,"This is my first job, is it acceptable or should I be looking elsewhere?",jobs," Basically I work in a retail store called Curry's in the UK, various job tasks include; Selling laptops, Tablets, serving customers, cleaning the department.

I'm good at my job I guess, I'm consistent. We have Targets that we are required to hit with every laptop and tablet. Like insurance (Although our insurance doesn't actually include accidental cover, loss or theft)

For example an Ipad 9th Gen worth ¬£3\`19, can get an extended cover of 3 years for probably around ¬£120. This is only really against breakdowns. Here is a breakdown of all our Targets:

Laptops fake insurance: 46%

Tablets fake insurance: 33%

Other fake insurance: 25%

Credit/Finance: 20%

Business VAT: 10%

Software (Anti-Virus, Cloud storage, Setups): 1/3 is recommended

Broadband Packages: Each department needs 1 a day (3 different departments)

Email Captures: Around 30%

Email opt in for marketing: Also around 30%

Every department has a department manager and in each department their used to be about 6 people working a day. However, with budget cuts right now everyone has bee reduced to working their contracted hours (8hrs/15hrs) a week. This people can not live on. Staff have left and departments are reduced to 3 per day.

I have served now at the store while going to University for 5 years now, My fellow colleagues have only been here for 7 - 9 months. My old colleagues that I enjoyed being around had left the store after they had graduated from University. The problem with the new colleagues is that they DO NOT work as hard as I do.

What went wrong today, I was scheduled in work earlier than the others, while I was in work during the morning before the store had opened up, I was cleaning the store and straightening up the shelves. Then as the day went on my manager was annoying me ONCE AGAIN.

Every time we are finished with a customer the manager holds on to the cage keys which has access to all the Tablets, laptops etc. This means every colleague wanting to sell one needs to ask for the keys, only the manager will not hand the keys over... Will instead, walk all the way out into the warehouse and monitor the person getting the item. While he is doing this, he asks us ""What do you know about your customer?"" ""Tell me about them?"" These are questions he uses to find out if we have went through a proper ""sales journey"" with the customer.

A sales journey, is basically where the employee must deceptively pry into the life of the customer, to find out if they can sell insurances or software. Managers assume, if you don't know about the customers family life, job or history then you haven't went through an adequate journey with them.

Now I can understand doing this to someone on a 3 month probation... But i've been here 5 years. I must sell about 10 items, some days 20 from the cage. Imagine hearing that every day over and over again. Sometimes a customer doesn't want to tell me what they're using the device for.

At the end of the day, the manager called all the staff around and basically said ""When I ask for this, this and this to be done I expect it to be done. This wasn't done. This wasn't done. That wasn't done. Stop holding hands! Your here to work, I don't want to have to do this again. When I ask 5 times for this department to be straightened I expect it to be done.""

Yea... Except he was looking at me the whole time... and the ""Holding Hands"" reference was to something he said to me earlier when I was cleaning the shelves and a colleague was following me around chatting not doing work. I had already cleaned and straightened the shelves in the morning, and I did it again in the evening...

Man as I write this, its almost like my subconscious is giving me advice... Is this normal for a work place? Or is it unfair? this has been my only job as someone in their early 20's."
473,My one and final working experience for a family member,jobs," 

Hello Reddit users! I am sharing my work experience with a family member and if this is not the right place to do so kindly let me know, I would take it down!

Warning: Long post ahead!

It was my last day of work last Friday. I decided to share my experience on Reddit, namely to release my penned-up negative emotions and to find closure in this chapter of my life.

I was looking for new career opportunity in June last year when I left my first job after University. It was then that I was approached by a family member to join their business. The business is in the retail/service line and has been running for the past 7 years with a little over 15 employees. They needed someone they could trust to assist them to expand internationally, to tighten and streamline existing company workflows as well as oversee the production and inventory of their products. Before I started my employment, we had a discussion on expectations of the role, the job scope and responsibilities. More importantly, we came to a mutual agreement that it is best to put away family relations and keep things corporate and professional.

Everything was going well for the first 1-2 months before I started noticing red flags that made me really uncomfortable.

There were too many red flags to go into details but I would share the top 3 that sealed the decision for me to resign.

1)The first 1-2 months were as per my job scope and responsibilities. For overseas expansion, we had a list of 5-6 potential countries and I was to research and propose 3 countries out of the list. For company workflows, I was to get involved with the day-to-day operations and come back with my observations on how we could make things more efficient. So after about 2 months, I came back with my proposal of the 3 countries, gave my observation that the company is lacking in structure, proper SOPs and the documentation of the SOPs as well as the existing ERP system is outdated and may not be able to properly support the company expansion plan. We had a meeting and we quickly agreed on the 3 countries, and I was to prepare the SOPs based on existing workflows. We also discussed what was needed to upgrade in the ERP and I was to check with ERP vendors on the cost to upgrade the existing ERP or to change ERP entirely.

However, at about 3 months in, I was asked to do the production of the products, packing of customers' orders and be general support to the marketing manager as her executive have recently resigned. I was perfectly okay to step in to help out as this was a small company but yet I was expected to deliver on my own job scope. We had meeting every week where we need to run through what we had done in the week to update them. I had brought it up to them that if I would to help out with other areas I would not have the time to complete my own job but yet this was brushed aside and I was still expected to help out and complete my own job.

2) The second red flag was that they expected employees to be professional and corporate but yet they could not draw the line between personal and corporate. They expected employees to be on time to work (office hours standard 9 am - 6 pm), any time-off request to be submitted at least 2 weeks in advance and whenever they call for meetings, they expect it to be a face-to-face meeting as they claim that calls/virtual is not as productive and not allowing WFH arrangement in periods where the government was encouraging employers to allow WFH due to covid.

Yet they come to work whenever they felt the need to (sometimes coming in to work one day a week), coming to work in improper dress code, leaving meetings halfway because they had to run for personal matters (picking their kids off school, going for dental appointments) and told us that they will continue the meeting over the phone. This may be their business but personally, it's too much of a double-standard and it does not sit so well with me. Additionally, whenever we had face-to-face meetings, they are always on the phone, texting and picking up calls without excusing themselves and expect employees to repeat when they missed out on what was presented.

I arranged a meeting with them to discuss some of these issues but there were some I could not bluntly say out as they were much more senior than me (I was brought up to be respectful to my seniors/elders) and we were family after all and I was afraid that if I was too blunt, it would affect our relationship. I tried to communicate as professionally as I could but I believe they didn't care about what I said as no change was ever done.

3) The 3rd or most ridiculous red flag was back in early Nov. I was scheduled to go for a shoulder operation to fix an old injury. I was given 8 weeks of hospitalization leave to recuperate at home. In the first week of my hospitalization leave (2 days after my discharge from the hospital), they asked me to set up a meeting with the selected ERP vendor to request a demo of the run-through of the proposed ERP system as they previously did not attend the demo run-through I had arranged prior to my surgery. I agreed to help them as I felt bad that I was on 8 weeks of leave and this is something that I could still do. So I scheduled the meeting for the following week (the second week of my hospitalization leave) and luckily the meeting was virtual due to Covid at that time. The meeting invite was given to them one week in advance and I send a text to remind them of the meeting as well. On the day of the meeting, they joined the meeting late and only when I contacted them if they were still joining. Thereafter, they sat in the meeting for 30 mins (it was a 2 hours meeting) before leaving and I was left in the meeting, going through the demo that I already had gone through and this was specially arranged for them during my hospitalization leave. I was lost for words and utterly pissed. Nonetheless, I asked questions that were not addressed previously and provided a summary of the meeting to them after the meeting.

Throughout the remainder of my hospitalization leave, they would call me to ""check-in"" with me on my condition but the call would always stir towards work and what I need to follow up on. Seeing as we are family I still help them out whenever I could and on days where I had to go to the hospital for consultation or physiotherapy I would tell them my limitations. On one occasion, I even sent them an email detailing all the issues and some of the red flags and I even went down to the office to have a face-to-face meeting to discuss how to resolve the issues. From the 5th week onwards of my hospitalization leave, I was also asked to go down to the office once a week for the weekly face-to-face meeting to update her on what was done in the week.

The final straw was that they decided that they wanted to put on hold the ERP project first and wanted me to finalize the SOPs before going with the ERP project. Yet during SOPs meetings, they are either late or completely no show (sometimes will call in over the phone or ask me for the update when the meeting ends) or when they do attend the meeting, they are always on the phone. I was also asked to continue doing the packing and performing stock take despite still recovering from a shoulder injury (Limited range of motion and no heavy lifting as of date)

Shortly after, I called them for a meeting, told them I was resigning. During the meeting, I was called a quitter/loser and someone that could not adapt to the environment and was still asked me to reconsider if I wanted to resign.

I politely took in the criticism, maintain my professionalism and send in my resignation by email after.

I am sharing my experience so that to others that are considering working with a family member, it is not as easy as it seems and sometimes you are threading on a thin line. I hope that none of you guys go through what I went through.

Here I am, the first month into 2022 - unemployed. But yet, this was one of the best decisions I made in my life so far.

TLDR - Had a bad experience working with a family member and resigned."

477,Having Trouble Breaking Into Entertainment,jobs,"Hi All,

I've been trying to break into the entertainment field for some time now with varied success. To put it shortly, I want to be a writer for television, specifically for animation. I have a BA in Film/TV and have done the odd freelance PA stuff, as well as volunteer work. I figure the best place to start is by being a full time production assistant and working my way up from there. However, whenever I submit to a company like Nick or Disney, I feel like I'm just tossing my application into the wind, because it always ends up getting rejected or never read. 

The only time I ever had success was when I applied to a personal email for a Nick job and got pretty far along in the process, but they ended up hiring internally. 

I moved out to LA two years ago, right before the pandemic, and started making friends and contacts, but with people still nervous to hang out, it's been hard to socialize and make contacts. 

I'm currently coming up on year three of an IT job I've been at that pays like trash and who are now expecting me to travel regularly with no pay bump. I don't even have insurance at this place, so I'm desperate to get out. 

I'm gonna leave a list of things I've done to at least help with my search, just so you know where I stand. 

**Things I've Done:**  
**Made a website**

**Organized a portfolio of writing samples**

**Refined my resume and LinkedIn**

**Attempted to use social media to make contacts** 

If anyone in the industry has any ideas on how to improve my search or any further questions about what I do, I'd love to talk. I feel like I'm kind of at the end of of my rope with this search, but I feel like I'm also just doing something wrong."

I'm generally happy with my life and the choices with which I've made thus far. However, there are some days where I just go on a binge and reminisce about the previous jobs I've had, and more importantly, the people I used to work with. Although we never were close, we weren't complete strangers as well. They were people I've worked with, gosh darn it. They were people I had to learn how to communicate with, tackled projects together, and spent time with. They have made me the person I am today, so in some sense, I am thankful for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I spent close to about 15 minutes just looking at people's LinkedIn pages, to see the jobs they've held prior to us working together, and where they have gone since post. While I'm set in my career and starting something fresh and anew in the summer of this month, I still can't help but shake and compare.

In a nutshell, I‚Äôd be helping in his documentary release campaign with the goal of building an audience around his film. In his words getting ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and ‚Äúfree‚Äù publicity through low hanging fruit. 

He said he only hired interns because hiring a publicist would run him a few grand and didn‚Äôt feel like spending that. I found it odd since he‚Äôs spent money on camera gear, covering entry fees at film festivals, and hiring graphic designers to do promotional art. Why not spend money where it counts and hire a professional? 

He fills me in on the tasks I‚Äôd be doing, which are keyword research on Google/Social Media, Creating Press Kits, Contacting Media representatives in Canada and US for media coverage, Researching Snapchat/Reddit platforms, and chiming in here and there with suggestions on PR related stuff 

Okay, cool. Doesn‚Äôt sound difficult except his expertise is in filmmaking and not marketing. So I‚Äôve had to be resourceful and figure out how to do some of this stuff myself. After spending a weekend scouring the web learning how to do the things he asks I send him a list of thorough suggestions regarding social media linking strategies, detailed summary of the Snapchat/Reddit landscape, and keyword strategies based on what I seen from the film. 

I did this since I won‚Äôt always have time to be available because of school and social obligations. I made this clear to him in the first call and he agreed. Now we‚Äôre a couple weeks in and seems he‚Äôs blocked me on iMessage recently, I call him and it went straight to voicemail, and haven‚Äôt received a response on email yet. I‚Äôll give him til Monday before cutting ties and looking elsewhere. 

I‚Äôll be honest I could have been more communicative and being more frequent about when I can and can‚Äôt be available. That‚Äôs the least one can do. 

While it stings he‚Äôs gone no contact like that, there‚Äôs a bit of relief too. I can allocate time to other internship opportunities that are more structured and organized. I still plan on keeping that experience on my resume though, as I do want to work in the entertainment industry. 

All this said, am I in the wrong? What does one do in a situation like this one?"
483,How to turn down a promotion and quit my current job gracefully?,jobs,"I'm currently in a tough spot and don't know what a good way to solve it. I hope you guys might have some insight and experience in dealing with this so hope you guys can give me some bits of advice on this.

Beginning of this year, I both received a promotion at my current place and an offer from another company that I interviewed earlier. Since the new place offers a lot more money, I decided to take it. Since the start date is in early Feb, I plan to hand in my resignation next week and give standard 2 weeks as most people suggest.

However, I currently have 4 FAANGs onsite interviews in those two weeks, so I prob won't be able to work at least 5 days of those two weeks. Since I'm just an entry-level engineer, I don't think there's much of a transition, but I was hoping that the two weeks would help with any administrative paperwork or any transition if it comes up.

However, I feel it's not the best way somehow, but I can't put a finger on it exactly. Is there a better to handle this? Should I tell my manager about the interviews? I have a good relationship with my manager, so is there a way to tell him gracefully?

Thanks!"

485,Why aren't compressed work weeks more common?,jobs,"Started a new job this past year and it happened to be a compressed work week. I work for 12 hours a day Monday through Wednesday and every other Thursday.

Initially, I thought I would hate it but took the job anyways because the pay was simply too much to turn down, but after a while I started to realize how great it was.

Every day for the last few hours of my shift I am earning overtime pay, and every Thursday my whole shift is overtime pay. Having weekdays as part of my days off is great, because I can head into a movie or visit a local park and have the place essentially to myself because everyone else is still at work. Additionally, with a 4 day weekend every other week I can basically go camping or head out of town for 3 days and go back home with a day to spare without having to use up any time off, and if I want to take a real vacation, all I need to do is ask for 3 days off and then I don't have to head into work for 10 days.

The only real downside I could think of is that it can be really hard to get anything done on the days you have to work once you're off the clock, but honestly even when I was doing 6 hour shifts working minimum wage jobs I was too burnt out to really do anything after work. Making food before/after work can be a bit of a chore as well but I learned that a bit of meal prep on a day off goes a long way.

Honestly I could understand someone in some minimum wage job or really any industry where you're expected to work every second of your shift not wanting to do 12 hour shifts. But I can't understand why anyone in an industry where you get your fair share of downtime would rather work 5 days a week than a compressed work week, and I honestly don't think I could go back to a standard schedule after working on a compressed work week.

Why aren't compressed work weeks more common? Why can't they be a standard for most white collar jobs?"

491,Hiring decision under consideration after final interview and unable to withdraw application.,jobs,"Hello folks,

I interviewed to one of the positions in a company early December and the hiring manager got back to me stating that you should expect a response after new year.

Before new year I was  able to see the status as ""under consideration"" on my job profile and status as ""interview"" when I tried to withdraw my application. I figured out the catch to see what status my profile is at for the role.
*Also, when I have status as ""not selected"". I get the notification from the company as not selected.

After new year I am able to see my status on my job profile as ""under consideration"". However, the job has disappeared from my withdraw application and I am unable to withdraw my job application.

I have reached out to the hiring manager asking for the outcome last and I haven't gotten back any response.
Also, the job position and requisition is still open.

What does it imply? Should I expect something?


Please help if someone has some insight.
Thanks again."

My friend has a BS degree for studies related to his department. Once he found out that his supervisor only has a high school degree and his new manager dropped out college, his coworkers encouraged him to apply for a supervisor position in a department that the new manager used to supervise. They advised him to go to the department director since they said if the new manager sees your level of education she would stop you from advancing. He went to the director and she said that she heard a lot about him and that she is happy to finally meet him. She thought he came to apply for the manager position so she said she already filled it and asked him why he didn‚Äôt apply. My friend was shocked that the director saw his potential so he said that he came for the supervisor position. She said the new manager is the one hiring and she asked if it was okay with him to have come over to talk with him. My friend had to agree. The manager came and once she saw his resume she started attacking him verbally so disrespectful. She even told him that he cannot sent emails related to his work to other departments and talk to her instead. She acted like a toddler throwing a tantrum. My friend tried so hard to keep his cool because he didn‚Äôt want to give the wrong impression to the director. He answered her questions about his work emails calmly and she couldn‚Äôt even look at him. The director said she is glad that he sent emails so they can change the work process for the way things are done and she said she will discuss his ideas with the department committee. My friend after calmly putting the new manager in her place after she was mocking his ideas. He said to the director that it wasn‚Äôt his intention to cause issues or miscommunication. The director said to him that he didn‚Äôt she just asked him to add them to his new emails so they can fix the process for the department as a whole. The manager then just got more pissed and told my friend that she will email him regarding the supervisor position but now she needs to talk to the director privately. My friend asked to take his resume back he knew she wouldn‚Äôt hire him but she asked to keep it. My friend stood up to leave while he was at the door the director said to him again that she is happy that she met and that she heard his name a lot. My friend smiled thanked her and left. What do you guys think of this messy meeting? How can he avoid conflict with this manager? What do you think the director thought of this based on her reaction?

497,Taking a year gap from full time work to study Physics before University?,jobs,"Hello:

I'm located in the US and currently work as a software engineer.

I want to take an elective in Denisty Functional Theory when I attend the Master's program I get accepted to. I won't apply for another 2 to 3 years. I'll be studying Bioinformatics and Applied Mathematics.

I have a math background with almost no courses in physics. To take this elective I need to be proficient in Modern Physics, Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, and Advanced Quantum Mechanics.

Since I'm currently in school online for a second B.S. degree in Computer Science, there is no way in any world where I can study Theoretical Comp Sci, Physics, Biology together while working full time as a Software Engineer.

I live with my parents, so rent is not an issue. I understand that I am very privileged. I'll have a couple years of current salary saved as an emergency / education fund in two to three more years experience.

Would it be career suicide to take a full year off from work to study physics then apply for and do a 2 year master's program in applied mathematics off my savings in preparation for a career change?

I'd have a 1 year job gap on my resume after 4 to 5 years work experience. Would including my self studies in my resume, provided I REALLY built the physics skills, have a beneficial effect?

There's too much I want to do during my Master's degree, so I cannot just audit the physics courses during my Master's on top of my expected workload."

The job doesn't go anywhere carrier wise (I've been there for 7-8 months), and I feel bamboozled by the manager. Basically tricked into taking the position with a promise of a different, higher position, that I know now is a fiction and a lie. First she promised me a higher position 3 months into the job, then at the beginning  of the new year. And what? Crickets. I figured out she way just saying anything to buy time and keep me at the job.

Also from time to time random coworkers, that are not even in my department are being rude to me, or should I say straight up mean. I am a high performer with a lots of ideas and a fast learner, I could do anything at that company, and they keep me at a shitty position that is way below my capabilities. I am most educated there. It's definitely the least challenging job I ever had in my life. I feel constantly bored, and all my ideas of improvement are just ignored. The tasks that they give sometimes are just... degrading. 

The only thing they figured out is to give me more tasks from a different department, so I do two things now, for two departments.

* Technical Projects (Regarding the degree)

512,"How much, if any, of my current situation is the fault of my superiors?",jobs,"* Around mid-September, I got a job as a Deputy Clerk/Office Assistant for a small Village's municipal government. My goal is to have a career in the public sector, so I was very happy to get this job.
* However, early into my time there, I noticed several issues and problems that I was not made aware of when I interviewed for the position. First, none of the other people working at the Village have been working there more than a year, meaning that no one there really has a lot of experience. Second, many of the previous employees were apparently not very good at their jobs, as things were and still are very disorganized, with everyone scrambling to try and fix things. Finally, there was a recent sidewalk project that ended up costing the Villagers a lot more than what was projected, and the property tax bills also had a significant increase as well, leading to many pissed-off villagers and greatly damaging the trust between the Village and its inhabitants.
* One other issue I would like to note is that, in my opinion, the training I received from the Village Clerk was not very good, as she only really gave me basic verbal instructions about the various tasks my job entailed, without any written instructions or anything. I have literally created pages of instructions and notes on my own in an attempt to improve my performance.
* Despite all of this, I did my best to have a good attitude and do my job well, which I thought I was, as both the Village Clerk and new Village Administrator who was hired back in December both said that I was doing well.
* However, in the past few weeks, things have suddenly taken a complete U-Turn, with both the Clerk and Administrator saying that I am not meeting the performance expectations of the position despite them supposedly trying to make things ""simpler"" for me, and as a result, I have been placed on administrative leave and was forced to turn in my keys.
* To be fair, I have been struggling with creating and posting Village Committee Agendas, which is a big part of my job and the main reason that they are upset with me. But in my defense, there are a few things I would like to point out.

1. Going back to my complaint about the poor training I received, the Clerk only showed me how to create and post agendas once before leaving me on my own.
2. I have suffered from depression and anxiety all of my life, and I recently started taking a new medication which has really helped my depression and energy levels but has caused me to develop sort of a ""brain fog"", by which I mean that I struggle to listen to people and remember what they have told me. Really, I am struggling with remembering things in general. I have made an appointment with my physician to figure this out ASAP.

* **What I Am Upset About**

1. As a result of the aforementioned issues I have, I ended up making several mistakes this week. I talked to the Village Administrator on Tuesday evening, where he basically spent 15 or so minutes chewing me out before asking me what I thought the problem was. I told him how I felt I wasn't properly trained due to the Clerk being so busy with everything else she has been having to do, but he said that that sounded like a cop-out to him. To me, it sounds like he has already decided that everything is my fault, so why did he bother asking me for my opinion in the first place?
2. When I came into work the next day, I saw that he had sent out an email to all of the Village staff and trustees in regards to him deciding to cancel a committee meeting because I did not post the agenda properly. While I can understand that, he went on to say that the reason for the cancelation was because ""the village employee responsible for posting the agenda and maintaining the public's trust in the village failed to do so"". So not only is he throwing me under the bus for the agendas, but now it's apparently my fault that the villagers don't trust the village?
3. Also, about two hours into work on Wednesday, he and the Clerk pull me aside to talk. I had expected this, and I was honest with them about my medication and the steps I have taken to improve. However, neither of them seemed to really care and said that they have decided to place me on administrative leave, as ""the village is trying to restore the people's trust in it, and my failures with the agendas have prevented them from doing that"". Not only do I think that placing me on administrative leave is a major overreaction, but I highly doubt the Villagers care as much about the agendas as they do about the sidewalk payments, property tax increases, and all of the other problems that the village has. I feel like I am basically being made a scapegoat here.
4. Finally, they said that they have talked to me several times about the agendas and that they have done their best to make things ""simpler"" for me. First off, until that meeting, their ""talking to me"" consisted of them making brief comments as I was in the middle of a ton of other stuff, meaning it did not register as something super important to me. Second, even if they have tried to make things easier on me, they never once stopped and asked me what I think would help. If they had, I would have told them I could use some more instructions and guidance to better perform my job.

* **My Questions**

1. Am I right to feel upset with them?
2. How much of what has happened is their fault, and how much of it is mine?
3. Do you think I am being treated unfairly?
4. Depending on whether or not they fire me, what should I do next?"

527,Reassurance,jobs,"Hi all. I'm just writing because I'd like some reassurance that I actually answered a question ok/if anyone has any opinions on it at all?

For context, I have just relocated from a teaching position. I wasn't feeling as passionate about teaching anymore, and with the upheaval of Covid, and working away from home and just feeling generally isolated/lonely, I felt that relocating and exploring new skills sets was what I needed.  
I applied for a job in an estate agents in my local area now that I have moved back home. The job description seemed like a really good fit for me- as a really organised person (coupled with some other factors), the job description felt very suited to me, and I put in an application.  
My interviewer contacted me yesterday and asked to speak with me over the phone today to arrange the interview. It was a short conversation, but during it, they asked me why I was seeking the career change. I feel *really stupid* in the sense that I wasn't really prepared for that question (like, how could I have not anticipated it???) and answered it the best I could. I basically said:

* I was living away from home and was feeling rather isolated so a change of location and moving back to my local area was a good choice for me.
* The upheaval of Covid was causing significant challenges in teaching (which the interviewer agreed with).
* I am a very organised person and feel that I could bring that to this position at the estate agents- I worded this in a positive way and the interviewer chuckled and agreed.

I would just like to add that I am not that shy when talking with people, so I don't personally believe that I sounded caught off guard by the question and that I handled it with confidence. I just can't help thinking that I could have answered it better, maybe by voicing more about how my skills set can come into play more within the job. I've also researched the company a fair bit and feel that I maybe didn't communicate that very well. I guess I'm almost worried that my answer came off as 'I need a job'- which is partly true, but I don't apply for positions that I don't feel I'd be good at (and I did mention that to the interviewer as well).

I have my face to face interview on Wednesday so I'll update with how that goes, and I already have some rehearsed answers for things I may get asked in that one. The company seems a good fit for me though, and I'm just worried that I could have answered that question better. For my application, I had to submit a cover letter which outlined in greater depth why I was a good fit, and the interviewer said he was happy with what I had written.

I'm likely over-worrying, but would appreciate some reassurance.

TL/DR: felt I could have handled an interview question better by elaborating more on how my skills set fits the job description. Worried if my answer could be interpreted in the sense of 'I need a job' and not necessarily putting a forward a convincing case as to why I would be a suitable candidate."
528,"If I enlist in the reserves, is my place of employment required to keep me employed?",jobs,"For the record, I am a state employee (teacher) in a right to work state (but also a very Red, pro-military state).

I have been looking at joining the reserves (Air Force), for graduate school/PPL scholarships/ and just to say I did my part and served in someway while I was young.  it 7.5 weeks of training upfront and then some degree of training after for whatever job I get. 

So, basically while I could do a large chunk of it over the summer when I am off, there is a strong chance I wouldn't be back until October. However, it appears that it is illegal for my place of employment to fire me for military duties, and they MUST assure my job is there when I get back. I would presume in this case, I just go on long term leave, they bring on a long term sub, and for my training period my business wouldn't pay me because I would be full time for the military.

Is this largely how it works? How does this work for people working other places that 1) don't have the summers off? 2) Don't have long-term subs? Basically, how do people do the upfront enlisting in the reserves while employed..."

There are a few states I‚Äôm interested in applying at but the issue I‚Äôm running into is that I‚Äôm either not getting responses or they‚Äôre denying me before I even get an interview. I need to spruce up my resume but I feel the major thing holding me back is me putting my home address.

I‚Äôve seen people say to omit it but the majority of online applications ask for it and it‚Äôs a mandatory fill in so I don‚Äôt know what to do. Everyone I know lives in my hometown so I don‚Äôt have any connections that I can use their address for and I‚Äôm sure writing N/A for application is not a good idea.  Any suggestions?"

531,How do I get noticed while obtaining another degree?,jobs,"Hi everyone. 

I have a BA in psychology and all of my ""real jobs"" have been psych related. I was recently let go from my last job due to my employer not being able to meet my medical accommodations after my non-FMLA leave. I'm not angry or upset about it as I was looking for another job anyways. Psych has sucked the life out of me and I CANNOT work another job in the field. 

I just began my MBA to make a career change. Most of the business jobs I'm looking at want either a BA in business (or something related) or X amount of years in finance, marketing, sales, and etc. 

I'm not in a huge rush right now to get something as I'm back to working in the restaurant industry where I made more than my previous job which required a BA. 

How do I get notice or begin to stand a chance in these ""businessey"" jobs? I've updated my resume and even highlighted that I'm looking for a career change. I've applied to \*some\* jobs but the one's I've applied to have not responded. 

I feel like I don't stand a chance until I have the MBA in hand. Any tips/advice?"
532,I didn't include unpaid internship experience in my background check. Am I screwed?,jobs,"I did an unpaid internship at a small company for several months around 5 years ago. Because this position was unpaid, I was not included in any payroll or HR documents. I didn't even sign an offer letter or contract/agreement of any sort. I just got a call to come in one day and started working. In retrospect, this company was pretty shady. I don't think they even had dedicated HR personnel. I tried reaching out to people from the organization who I worked with, but from what I can tell, this company was acquired by another business early last year so I've been unsuccessful in reaching anyone who might still work there and could act as a verifying party. 

I knew that there would be some issues verifying this experience because of issues mentioned above, so I just left this off of my HireRight background check. I do have this listed on my resume though, and now I'm quite worried that leaving this out was a mistake...I feel like my reasons for leaving it out are relatively understandable, but I've also never worked with a company that requires a background check like this. 

Have I messed up here? If anyone has experienced something like this, please share. Thanks"

535,How should I reply to a recruiter reaching out to me on LinkedIn in this situation?,jobs,"I'm currently working at a company I dislike, so I'm searching for a better opportunity. A recruiter reached out to me for an interesting position however I'm kinda skeptical about the company because it's new with only 3 employees, they follow a ""Talent as a service"" business model.

The thing is I want to first try my luck with the companies I'm interested to work for but this may take time, so if it doesn't work out I don't mind working for the recruiter who reached out to me on LinkedIn, I just need to know how to reply to them professionally in this case."
536,"I'm looking for a better job but my current one is so much lower than what I have done in the past that it will put off recruiters, what can I do?",jobs,"Here is the problem: I have two much better jobs before this one on my resume, but unfortunately they are not the first thing that the recruiters see. I want them to see first all the office management and executive assistant things I've done but the first thing is something like customer service or something. I don't want to give you a hint, that's just what I call it for now. Can I tell you what I do so you can say two words to name it? I also have a hard time writing 3 lines (like bullet points) to describe what I do because it's so stupid. I'll write here (translated in English) what I have on it, but it kinda sucks.

I work for a big insurance multinational company who has a subsidiary who gives assistance to the insured person if something covered by the policy happens. It deals with practical assistance for health, home and cars. I started for 8 months in the car department, basically sending towing trucks through our suppliers and then book a courtesy car or send a taxi home to them. After that my company took in an order for 3 years from a luxury car dealership to do similar things for them, basically those client don't have an insurance but their car is under warranty. It offers a wider range of options, like towing the car everywhere you like it for free, having the repaired car delivered at home, many taxi rides, trains and flights home, repatriating the car for repair from abroad, courtesy car from a top brand as long as you need it. It's a lot of demanding people used to get whatever they want, it includes assistance abroad and tricky things like difficult towing. I've been there for almost 4 year and I have a permanent contract.

What I do on my resume is calling it ""customer service"" and list the following (apologies for the quick translation, it's so hard to translate condensed sentences like those for bullet point lists):

\- multilingual assistance to client owners of luxury brands in the automotive sector

\- management of overseas cases activating and coordinating local correspondents

\- assigning secondary benefits and managing assignments to our suppliers

I know, it sucks. This on the other hand is a quick list of things I've done in my previous jobs and that I want to do again. They are just damn below the current job so you have to move down the page to see them, if you are not discarding me after the first.

It's all of this: translations, organising events, preparation of documents for meetings etc, invoicing, organising meetings and conference calls, managing the daily activities of the office, being in charge of contracts with suppliers and outsourced services, writing the yearly budget, reporting every month with an analysis of the client's profile, organising business trips, reviewing presentations for conferences, managing the archive of dossiers clients and invoices, creating the databases for the archive. Total 7 years (5+2).

It's not a great life but it sounds better than whatever I'm doing now. I have a degree in Anthropology so there is no real stable job with a permanent contract and a decent salary out there. I'd like to go back to my better jobs, but there is my current one that acts as a downer."

552,Scared of looking for work.,jobs,"I haven't worked in a little while and I need to find a job pretty soon but I'm terrified for several reasons. One being I'm still not good in public environments and having to interact with many people. Second one being this'll be the first time I look for a job of my own choice and I'll explain. So basically I was in a youth work program where I was employed by them instead of the managers of where ever it was I went. The program chose the job sites for me and I feel that there was more leniency there because of that.

Now I'm out of that part of the program and the choice of finding somewhere myself is scary and some fears are coming with it. I didn't need to fill out job applications where there's some parts in my circumstances I wouldn't even know how to answer. Like not having a license or a vehicle but there being a field to write my license number. How would that look if I left that blank? Would I even get the job?

Another is the fear of me not really having many social skills or specific talents in any area. Closest I've been to being fully comfortable with a job was a janitor and even that got cut short thanks to covid closing all of the schools forever so there was no use for me. Can't clean the school if nobody is in it. So I'm afraid if I go into something new and unfamiliar (like walmart stocking and unloading for example) I fear that my boss may not have patience for multiple mistakes. I have adhd and learning new things in a timely manor is a massive pain in the ass for me. I take a long time to feel a groove. 

And as I mentioned with the walmart example I don't know exactly what I'd be doing and what they'd make me do. I'm not comfortable driving a forklift so would they make me go right into doing something like that or would I actually get decent and lengthy training for what I'm doing? I basically have like no confidence in not only finding a new job but doing a good job and keeping the job. 

I'm super pattern based and the only reason I was so comfortable being a janitor was because it was easy. I did basically the exact same routine from the moment I stepped in the door to when I left and I loved that. And most of the day was after school hours so I didn't have to deal with a bunch of people. I had one job of the 3 I had which was my last one where I never knew what it was I was doing until I was doing it and I hated that. It left more room for mistakes than what I was already prone to making.

Does anybody have any helpful advice as to what would potentially fit what I'm looking for? Or maybe some assurance to if I did get a potentially daunting job that they wouldn't just throw me to the wolves if I wasn't prepared for it or if I didn't meet standards fast enough?"

555,Depressed at the thought of full time work,jobs,"I just graduated a couple months ago after 4 years at university, had the last couple months off, and tomorrow I‚Äôm starting my first full time job.

Everything about this job looks ideal - it‚Äôs the position I was hoping to start with after graduating, entry-level, pays well, the people seem nice, the commute isn‚Äôt too bad and it‚Äôs halfway between me and my partners house (we live an hour apart), I can work from home a couple days a week after I‚Äôve been there 6 months, etc - but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling of overwhelming depression about starting a full time, 9-5 job.

After studying for 4 years and getting months at a time off, having weekdays free when I didn‚Äôt have classes, getting to go on trips or socialise basically anytime I wanted, and having lots of time to do the things I like, the thought of only having a few hours to myself each evening + weekends sounds exhausting. 

I‚Äôm really trying to look at it positively, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like my freedom that I‚Äôve had basically all my life is about to get stripped from me and I‚Äôm grieving over the loss of months long holidays, and lots of free time, that I‚Äôm basically never going to get back again now that I‚Äôve started working. The thought of only getting a few weeks holidays each year and the occasional day off feels suffocating and impossible to live with.

I've probably applied to 30+ positions online and only heard back from like a handful, who all rejected me.

579,Am I getting lowballed by these recruiting agencies?,jobs,"Currently I'm contemplating a pricing analytics offer for a staffing company that is contracted with a reputable automotive company and the pay is about $57,000 for 12 month contract, no benefits. There's a good history of being hired and onboarded, but I'm not sure if I am willing to take the risk for a seemingly low salary. The role is pretty standard with SQL, PowerBI, Alteryx, etc. so it's a good opportunity to hone on my skills with it. However, even as a fresh grad, I do already have 1-2 years of experience on these technologies with an actual analytics/BI internship. This is the only substantial offer I 've got, but I'm still currently in my internship making about $39,000 a year and have until the rest of the year to figure out my next job.

Does this amount seem right? I feel like I'm worth more looking at Glassdoor salaries predictions, and my main concern is if that I should be aiming higher given I've got the internships under my belt.

The real issue is: there's no room for growth or even educational opportunities, my boss(es) are total jerks, and a lot of the work culture is toxic. 

Lesser-known org: $7 million budget at a 20 year old org that's had a lot of growth just in the past few years. It isn't well-known but it does decent work. There's far less access to power brokers, but the new position is equivalent to that of my current boss, the pay isn't great for that position but I'd be moving up the ladder and making more than I am now by a lot. The benefits are great, the culture (from the outside) appears to be miles better than my current gig, but I'm nervous about how the org isn't as well-established which seems important in these uncertain times.

I was a new hire and I feel I was a bit bullied by the other colleagues and I think one was trying to make me quit as he felt threatened (supervisor). I was only there a few months. I also think I just didn't really fit into the culture of the place as it felt pretty toxic for a workplace (can't give details but yeah it was toxic). The colleagues I worked with were only there a month or two more than me as the previous team was gutted due to poor systems in place and arguments over mistakes, etc that couldn't be rectified.

I even told the owner that the company was just fucking dire from seeing how it operated and did a few things that may have pissed off the supervisor or made him look a bit incompetent in his new role. Owners basically leave it up to the supervisor to run and have very little involvement in the company.

It's weird, the owner even suggested I work for myself as I think he saw I had potential but I just keep revisiting every so often in my head the bad bits of the job and it's just something I don't seem to let go.

It's almost been two years since the pandemic and the beginning of the pandemic always reminded me of that job. Nonetheless I keep revisiting the memories. I wouldn't to back there and in fact I think some of them are just nasty insecure people.

Saying all this has anyone else had this sort of thing. It gets me angry at times and I'm at a stage where I'm not really sure what to do with my life!

The company is quite small but I do sort of report to someone who assigns jobs as they come in. However a lot of things at this place seem to go directly through the CEO or President. So I‚Äôm not entirely sure who to tell of my resignation. From what I understand it should be my ‚Äúsupervisor/boss‚Äù and HR?

In terms of the CEO and President I can‚Äôt say I have a great relationship with them as I find them very unapproachable and intimidating. Given their personality I‚Äôm worried they would take it personally. I‚Äôm quite a quiet guy and don‚Äôt do great with conflict or with people with their personality in general. 

My other worry is someone else is most likely letting them know they are leaving as well on the same day. Unfortunately with my expected start date I have to let the company know on Monday. This person referred me to the company and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm leaving because this person is also leaving but it just happened to be a coincidence. 

As is probably obvious this whole thing is making me quite nervous, but I feel I may be over thinking it."

588,My former employer is trying to screw me over,jobs,[removed]
589,Job searching is draining me,jobs,"Just like the title reads and is very similar to those who have posted before me, job searching is killing me. I graduated in Dec. of 2020 with my master's degree. I am in the nonprofit/public service sector. I was able to hold an internship in 2019 during my undergrad but when I started my masters I was unable to find anything due to the pandemic. This past year I was lucky enough to find a part-time position at a small nonprofit in my state doing grant writing/development work but was told recently that we did not have the funding for me to even be on part-time, but for special projects only. I have been looking for full-time work since August of 2021 and have had no luck whatsoever. I have had a handful of interviews (phone screening, 2nd rounds, 3rd rounds) but have never ever received an offer. I've been told in interviews that ""this seems like a perfect fit for you etc..."" but as I said, nothing follows through, or I have been ghosted. I've applied to everything and anything, tried using a recruiter (who ghosted me), part-time, entry-level, associate, and even internship positions and no luck.

I have tried to reach out to the people I have interviewed (who have emailed me to reject me) to see what I could do better but most of them ghost me afterward. I did have one person tell me that she thought I was the perfect candidate and wanted me for the position but someone on the hiring team was unsure about my skills so ultimately I didn't get the job. I have utilized my connections and everything and there is still nothing. I am not sure what I can change to make me more appealing to my interviewers and I am so frustrated. 

If anyone has had success after being in a situation like this, can you tell me what was your turning point?"
590,What should I do?,jobs,"Hi, I just graduated from college and  6 months ago I was hired at a company in Mexico to work with the US team. This means that even though I work for the US, I am being paid in mexican pesos and with the usual benefits the companies offer in mexico. 

Although the pay is more than average for someone my age, I think I‚Äôm being underpaid because of one main reason: 
I have passed very challenging certifications that a person in the US could have passed as well and his entry level salary would be $65,000 - $70,000. 

Stupid me, when I negotiated this offer, I ended up with a yearly salary of $20,000 (Again, for someone my age in Mexico, this salary is way more than average). Now I honestly regret this because I could have easily negotiated a salary of $30,000. 

In addition to that, in this months I‚Äôve been working very good (my manager and co-workers have told me that for the amount of time I‚Äôve been working, I‚Äôve been learning really fast). In fact I have done very (and notorious) improvements on some reports. 

Thus, my question is what would you do on my situation? I really would like to ask for a raise but I don‚Äôt even have a year working here. I think I deserve a more high pay, not only because of my certifications, but because of the big improvement I have done. 

I‚Äôm not looking (yet) to get paid with the US entry level of 70k, but something more reasonable since I‚Äôm based in Mexico. 

Thank you!"

Not sure who to share this info with or where to post, so I'll post it here...

One thing I learned in this lockdown is how much I love remote: from my internship to the university classes, it's great. Furthermore, my country's currency is not in its best condition, so earning in another currency (e.g dollar or euro) would be a significant boost.

However, my search doesn't seem to be very fruitful, as pretty much every single role I've found was a Sr role. It's like for every 10 Sr roles I find, there's one Jr one which most certainly will ignore me (is it because of my [resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/s2i7am/looking_for_junior_roles_at_the_it_industry_help/)?

I have a 1 on 1 with my boss (regularly scheduled) and he told me last week that because so many people have left, he wants to talk about what makes us happy or upset and what would make us want to stay. I have already decided I‚Äôm not staying, and I‚Äôm leaving sooner rather than later. So now I feel like my options are
1. Tell my boss at this 1 on 1 so I don‚Äôt have to completely lie in the meeting about retaining me. But before I have an official offer signed. 
2. Lie or fib in this meeting about my situation, telling him I would be happier with thing 1 and 2, just to blindside him the next week when I have actually signed an offer.

I really enjoyed the inmates and the job in general, but the schedule was awful.

627,I filed a claim against my previous employer.,jobs,"There is a lot to unload here, so I am sticking to the essentials related to my claim, but keep in mind there are a lot of other details that will be left out for the readers sake (sorry, I couldn't help myself in the end, that bit is relatively optional to check out). This is my first job in over 10 years that I walked out from without a 2 week notice.

I worked in a wig salon as an administrative assistant and received patchy training to sell the wigs. I did everything from schedule personal appointments for the owner, to cashing out customers, to cleaning the salon and more. 

1st claim was for wrongful deduction from wage for a tax miscalculation on a sale at the register. Total deduction $115.xx. Her system was as much pen and paper as possible because she has an aversion to technology. How can she NOT account for human error with this sort of system. I have seen first hand her mark up on products. It is 2.5√ó wholesale price for the wigs, hats and hair products. ($200 wholesale for a wig meant $500 retail on the floor, with wigs going out the door for upwards of $1,000.) Small accessories sucha as brushes, liners and the such, mark up was arbitrary, some items are wholesale for pennies on the dollar, brushes were something like 20 for $20, and marked up to $10 per item retail. There is no way she can justify docking me $115.xx, is there? Am I wrong? 

2nd claim was for tips not paid out. Yes. My training was patchy, but for the 2 sales that I made, which resulted in roughly $120.00 in tip out, I didn't see any of that. In addition to this, she has a volunteer on staff who makes no claim to her tips, so all tips earned for her sales go straight to profit. I had shadowed other consultants for 2 months. Every consultant had a last review by the owner with the client for her final opinion and recommendation. This is exactly how it went with the sales that I had made, all the leg work done by me, with final opinion made by owner. She kept those tips and never mentioned it. I have asked for opinions on this bit, and it's been mixed, one person says I am technically still under training and should not expect it, so I left it at that. But, now I am spiteful. So I added it to my claim with the local labor law department.


Again, so much detail left out, brief summary (to the best of my ability) goes like this: owner was rude and withholding of tasks so that I had to ask for step by step instruction on a daily basis, disrupting work flow; training pay was misscommunicated and several occasions; owner spoke to staff in demeaning tone, IN FRONT of customers; she constantly complained that she has been training new employees for over a year because no one was competent; pay out was sporadic at best and very unorganized, missing days worked, calculated by, her judgment, the most Excel savvy staff member available. Short list. There's more, so much I think I could write a book that no one wants to read ever."

636,Looking for some advice about LinkedIn.,jobs,"I am a mature university student - I went back to school after working in retail management for about 5 years. Throughout school, I've worked various part-time jobs. I'm trying to figure out whether it's better to include those part time jobs on my LinkedIn job history to show that I've been working during school, or to just leave them out.

I'm worried that if I delete them, it will just look like I have a large, 4-year gap in my work history (LinkedIn shows education below job history, and I'm worried at my age that nobody will even think to consider that I've been in school).

On the other hand, I think they make my Jo history look pretty messy and irrelevant. They're all low level, close to minimum wage jobs that I held for a year each maximum. I feel that my management jobs that I held before going back to school are much stronger and make me look much more professional. My main concern is just, as I mentioned above, having an apparent 4-year gap in my job history.

637,Exit interviews,jobs,"I've been in the workforce for quite a few years. I've worked at a few different companies.

My question is this: Has anyone ever been brutally honest during an exit interview with HR? My thoughts are that HR should already know/see problems staring at them. For example, if such and such team has a very high turnover,  and it is known in the company that the team manager is an insufferable idiot, then why does HR try to pretend they don't know what's wrong?"

A week and half ago, I was given an offer at an old job of mine to work about 32 hours a week. I let my boss know this is what was going to be happening -- and that I would be fine with the schedule we have now with the only thing being I have to leave at 1. She's the GM and she said yes to this. 

Today, I reminded the manager in charge today that I had to leave at 1. She asked me why and I let her know it's due to my second job. She started snapping at me saying that I didn't want the hours given and that I deliberately took off time that they had given me. (This wasn't true -- I let my gm know that my grandma had an emergency and I need to go to her house on Monday and Tuesday to help her -- these were days i already had off every week.) Now, I'm apparently not a team player and when I tried to explain I needed this second job so I can actually afford to live on my own she cut me off and said, ""people are either and team player and you're clearly not."" 

I don't think I'm being unreasonable -- I can't afford to be skimped hours like this when I was promised 25 to 32 when I was hired. I'm worried I'm going to be fired.

Department head said he would reach out to me in the new year when they determine which roles will
Be available because they truly valued my work and didn‚Äôt want me to leaves 

I just got asked by the same CFO to get breakfast next week and catch up. Do senior executives tend to reach out to individual contributors? I don‚Äôt know what to expect.

642,Interview Scheduling Conflict - Thoughts on Options,jobs,"Hi all! I‚Äôm seeking advice/thoughts on doing a virtual interview right after an out-of-town appointment. 

So, I am currently in the process of interviewing for a new job. (Love my current job but I need specific insurance coverage that I am not getting right now.) Friday afternoon I received an invitation to schedule an interview for a job that had and still has a lot of openings. 

Anyway, my invitation requested that I use Doodle to schedule something by Tuesday morning. Figured I would do it this weekend. Then, later that afternoon, I receive a ‚Äòreminder‚Äô email from the employer about scheduling soon because they would be closed Monday for the holiday. Okay, no problem, I‚Äôd do it after dinner. 

By the time I check the availability, there is only one slot left. Which is fine, but it butts up against a doctor‚Äôs appointment I have had scheduled for over a month. The appointment is ~40 minutes from my house in a small town where I‚Äôm not sure I could find solid wifi anywhere like a cafe (Starbucks isn‚Äôt a thing out there). I might be able to do a hotspot from my phone and use my laptop or tablet, but reception down there is spotty. Plus, I‚Äôm not 100% sure my plan covers my phone being a hotspot anyway, so it might not be viable. 

So my options are:

**Option 1**
Try to do the interview with my phone from my car. I can use a virtual background and headphones and just make the most of it. While I have done phone interviews in the past (and rocked it), I feel weird about doing a Teams interview over the phone. I suppose I could pop on for introductions, explain my situation, then hop off video. (But this still requires the extra work of dressing up and makeup just for a couple of minutes of face time, which is a mild bummer.)

**Option 2**
Send them an email to ask to reschedule, which they won‚Äôt see until the day before the scheduled interview. They have two afternoons back-to-back carved out for interviews. 

**Option 3**
Idk. Ask my doctor if I can use their wifi? lol


I‚Äôm probably way overthinking and I‚Äôve had interviews this last week that went well. I still would like to make a good impression, though, because it is definitely a job I‚Äôm interested in. 

Thank you!!"

644,Lost/Left the best job I'll ever have. Now I'm miserable.,jobs,"Hi all -

I had no idea that losing a job could trigger a major grief response and I'm completely miserable over it. I'm a contractor and I was filling in as a director at an org I'm a member of and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. They loved me and couldn't stop showering praise on my work. The work fed me and gave me life and joy I've never really known. When my contract expired they suddenly decided to eliminate my role and offered me one at like half my pay grade. It's because the faith-leader of the organization felt threatened. She's very unpopular - mostly because she's not very nice - and felt threatened by all the positive feedback and attention I was generating. She started making my work really hard and the board decided the best way to deal with the conflict was to effectively demote me. I said no because it's insulting. It was torture, but I know it was right. But I've been in agony ever since. I can't concentrate on my other work. I keep crying. I feel sad and like queasy all the time. I'm experiencing real grief. Meanwhile everyone there doesn't even seem to understand why I'm so upset. This job was amazing and so right. I feel like I'll never be that happy again. IDK what to do. I have other work. I'm not really that worried about staying afloat. I was overbooked, but I'm heartsick over it. It's what I wanted to be doing. I'd never experienced that before.

I want to add that everyone there is aware I don‚Äôt have experience in working in care in a professional sense. 

For the three days I was scheduled in 9AM-4:30PM. 

Day 1: I spent this just on the computer doing general starter modules like data protection, records management etc. 

Day 2: I had a change of clothes so I was able to go in the wings with the residents. I observed the start of the staff getting up a resident but was pulled away to watch covid video. After that I was taken back to the wing and saw the very end of another residents morning wake up. I‚Äôd missed the morning breakfast routine. I was then sitting in the lounge and read care plans, I helped give out teas and coffee but before I was observe how lunch happened I was taken away to do more modules and that was me for the rest of the day. 

Day 3: Again because of my start time I‚Äôd missed breakfast and observing waking up residents. I was told to sit and read care plans again. I did get told a bit more about the place that day like, fire drill, the folder to fill out in morning routines. I helped out in lunch and gave out afternoon teas and coffee on my own. I was on and off reading care plans in between things. 

On day 3 I‚Äôd asked what‚Äôs happening next week and they told me I was going into normal shift pattern. I expressed to the manager I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve observed anything. She told me she ‚Äòmay‚Äô be able to get me with another staff member on the Tuesday. I‚Äôm just a little taken aback I expected to be shadowing for at least a week, but by the sounds of it I‚Äôm expected to be able to wake up residents on my own by the Wednesday. This home is run by the council so I expected the training to be intense and thorough. 

I feel like I could be really good at this job but the training and how people are acting around me is just putting me off and triggering anxiety. What training should you get as a new support worker?"
646,Worried about employment history verification after official offer letter.. Big 4,jobs,"Hello everyone, 

I received a verbal offer from a big4 and I will most likely be receiving the official offer with 2 weeks. I graduate in May. I am a little worried about the employment background check that will be conducted after receiving the offer, for I don‚Äôt know how it usually works. 

On my resume, I have 3 work experiences, one of was paid, through an employer, it can be 100% verified by calling HR. 

My other work experience (most recent), was an internship at a research lab in a university. I was working with a PhD reserved on his research. However, the nature of how research labs are in academia, I was not employed by the university. My relationship was with the phd academic. Hence, if they call the university to verify my employment, they won‚Äôt be able to verify it unless they contact the Phd academic in the lab (they did not ask me to provide phone numbers or any emails while applying) 

My third work experience was between 2014-2016.. also, I was an undergrad. I worked and took leadership position as a student by which I received credit hours for it, but it was not paid. If they call my undergrad institution, they won‚Äôt be able to verify it. Furthermore, my professor who was my boss retired in 2017 I guess. I don‚Äôt know how I can prove these experiences. 

These experiences are very impressive and I had to mention them as work experience in my resume for they are related to my position . But I am worried that if they can‚Äôt verify them then my offer will get denied. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

I feel as if I have to babysit the entire store and people still don't end up being happy and that I don't get paid enough. You have to take care of every part of the store and your you own donations all at the same time. 

Donations has to take care the production area where they sort the clothes and the things on the shelf. We gotta change their boxes and bring them to the back of the store. And sometimes even work their part of the store. All well managing our own boxes that sit outside that get full rather quickly and whenever shit goes wrong like they get bad clothes we get shit for it cause we didn't sort it good enough. We are never given enough resources to get everything done and are constantly going day by day running out of boxes and places to put things.


We have days where the production area is overfull in the boxes and we have to manage to clean up what's left overnight because people illegally dump on us and that will range from trash to moldy or piss covered furniture and management refused to do anything about it. The manager said she talked to the police about it but after a week of nothing changing I went up and asked them myself  they said to give their number to manager and she didn't say anything.

648,How to recover from job abandonment?,jobs,"I had an unpaid internship in the fall with a company that I enjoyed working with. I was working two other part time jobs at the time and in the first semester of my junior year. They were really flexible with my schedule but I was very overwhelmed due to taking on so many jobs and school work. 

My supervisor didn‚Äôt really communicate with me much. I would come once or twice a week and make graphics for the social media with little supervision, I would just check with them before I posted/scheduled. I usually got good feedback but a lot of the time it just felt like busy work. 

I took too much on and since it was unpaid I put it towards the last of my priorities honestly. I just couldn‚Äôt handle all the pressure from my school work and other jobs, knowing I was there doing unpaid work that wasn‚Äôt challenging or engaging me. I felt like I was volunteering.


I stopped going in and nobody contacted me or anything, but I did feel like it was inappropriate of me to not communicate that I wanted to end the internship.

Now he wants me to do another project without even finishing the current TWO I work on. I cannot take it anymore, especially with the low cost programmers he hires for the backend(I do the front-end) who do such a crap job and are like 6-8 hours on another timezone.

I have a few questions. I have never been screened for a drug test before and I have some concerns. I don't do any illegal drugs, however, in my state Ohio, CBD/Delta8 is legal. I don't often smoke or use the gummies but sometimes I do when I have a headache or no appetite. Since this has some level of delta 8 THC if I fail a drug test because the screenings are not yet capable of differentiating between illegal and legal (delta 9 vs delta 8)  thc will I be disqualified? 

For me, it doesn't make much sense that I can do something totally legal and yet potentially be disqualified from a job. 

Should I let the hiring manager know as soon as I'm told I'll have a drug screening? I have my final interview this week, and I doubt I would even test positive in the first place since it's been several weeks since last using a CBD gummy but still. Or should I deal with it if/when the test is positive? 

Again, I have not smoked weed in almost 5 years and when I did it was rarely anyways. I have always just worked at places that the employers didn't really care about anyways but that's because it wasn't a corporate culture. This is a medium-size company definitely not massive it's a car dealership in a marketing dept."

680,Should you quit as soon as you feel like it or are there bad consequences for this?,jobs,"Long story short, I was more neurotically concerned about making sure to give my company ample notice (perhaps 2 months, give or take a month) in case I found a new job, as I thought it would be an inconvenience for them to find someone to replace me to handle the workload I usually do, plus I‚Äôve been there about 5 months and have learned and been trained a lot.

Unfortunately in other places in my life there‚Äôs this sense of comfort and satisfaction and relaxation when people praise you and give you positive feedback and you feel like they value your contribution. Unfortunately at this company it just didn‚Äôt work out. There was tension from the beginning and I‚Äôve had maybe 2 kind of intense disciplinary conversations about how I‚Äôm not being so and so, in the way they want me to be. (It‚Äôs not the quality of my work but more how I fit into the company culture, sort of).

I was really committed to shouldering minor inconvenience and just kind of assumed that in the beginning it‚Äôs natural to have a few false starts but I thought over time we would settle into a good equilibrium and the stress/pressure would come down.

Unfortunately I had a final kind of review conversation with my manager about what my plans are for nearing my post work-trial ‚Äúprobation‚Äù period and I was really disappointed to still not have a welcome, positive or appreciative evaluation, even when I was trying my best to make it work despite discomfort.

It led to a paradigm shift where I felt like I don‚Äôt need to feel guilty about quitting suddenly. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wanted or that it‚Äôs working out. I don‚Äôt look forward to going to work anymore being told I‚Äôm unwanted.

A part of me is still trepidatious about quitting like on a one day notice immediately, but I‚Äôm seriously considering it. I‚Äôll try to go on unemployment till I find my next job.

What bad things happen if I quit just like that? Is that something that happens in the corporate world and is valid or can they do something bad to me or anything? Do they pay a half month of salary if you quit mid-month?

(In case you‚Äôre reading this and assuming it must have been me that had the behavioural issue, not them, just keep in mind there‚Äôs a lot of kinds of people in the world and not everybody is destined to have a good coworker relationship with everybody else. I‚Äôve had some great partnerships in my life but now I understand this one just isn‚Äôt going to work out.)

Tl;dr: Should I just quit Monday morning or should I give notice or anything? Is this a financially terrible idea?

Thanks for your input!"

Our client accounts Facebook Ads were hacked and the hacker stole over thousands of dollars in Ad spend money. I am the only Ads manager at our agency. My role is digital marketing strategist and when this all happened I was shocked because I never seen this happen before.

My supervisor and I worked together in securing the accounts and all my colleagues had questions that I couldn‚Äôt fully answer and it stressed me out. 

I feel like my agency should hire an IT professional to help aid with security breaches such as this. I just feel like this was out of my arena, pay grade and knowledge. However, I helped in every way I can by contacting Facebook and reporting the breach.

It‚Äôs now Saturday and I‚Äôm still thinking about this, more so how all my employees and the CEO may view me from here on out in a negative way possibly because I manage the account and this happened.

690,Layoffs have thrown all my plans into disarray - how do I proceed?,jobs,"For four years I have been working as a data scientist in the research and development segment of a large health insurance company. Right before Christmas, I was accepted into a graduate program (Master of Public Health in epidemiology). I was very excited because I had been planning for this with my managers for several years. My initial plans had been derailed by the pandemic, but things were looking less dire and I had finally gone for it. The plan was to go to school while still working part or full time in my current position. I am the primary income earner for my family and we can't afford to have my hours drop drastically or for me to not work.

But then this week I got laid off. Up until the day management delivered the news, everything had been going great. I had even been given a small promotion to individual contributor to both recognize the independent work I have been doing over the last year, and to give me more flexibility leading up to my return to school.

Now I have to figure out how to apply to jobs while still pursuing my education. I don't want to (and can't really afford to) go back to service work at/near the minimum wage, so I'm trying to look for professional jobs in my current and future field. I still have about 8 months before school starts. 

How do I address my educational plans in resumes/cover letters/interviews? Should I even bring it up yet?"

The guy loves me but he's poison, all he does is complain constantly and he unloads it all on me, and he's the type of guy who loves his own voice, doesn't stop talking, you can't get a word in, he'll complain, then tells you the same story 30 mins later, he is walking negativity.  If it was a big place then no problem ditching him but there are only 5 of us.  As I say I thought for a long time I hated my job but its not the job I hate its him and his negativity."

708,Should I inform my HR about an interview I attended a few months back?,jobs,"I am a 23M working as a Business Analyst at a Soonicorn tech startup in India. I make 115,000 INR a year and was employed here right out of college in Mar 2021. I had expressed my interest in shifting to Product Management during August 2021 and my VP had promised me a shot at an interview. During Sept of 2021, I was also reached out to by another very popular Indian unicorn for an interview for the role of Data Analyst(the exact same role I was already working at). I decided to go ahead with this opportunity though I had no intention of joining even if I got an offer from them as I was fixated on shifting into Product Management.

I went through all rounds of the interview and got an offer from them for the role of Data Analyst with a yearly compensation of 170,000 INR (around 50% more than my current comp though I had only 6 months of work experience ever). I accepted the offer and turned them down a month later citing that I was promised a shot at an interview at my firm for the role of an APM. During this time I also had received confirmation from my VP that I would have interviews scheduled during mid November. Fast forward to first week of December and I had cleared all rounds of interviews. I am to assume office for the APM role from April 2022 onwards.

Until now, I haven't discussed the pay I'd be receiving with anyone from HR or with my VP yet. I had asked them for the details of pay and they were yet to get back to me. Yesterday HR responded with `Hello, the CTC will be decided basis the appraisal cycle. You will be informed about the same then. I'll also inform VP and we will discuss this once the increment cycle approaches.` The appraisal cycle is basically during April of each year in my company. I was under the impression that I'd receive pay that would be in accordance with the role I'd be joining, which I estimate to be around 170,000 to 180,000 INR but now HR is saying that it will be on the basis of my appraisal cycle. I have a call with her on Monday to just get some clarity. My question is do I tell her about the offer I received from the other company for the DA role with a yearly comp of 170,000 INR 6 months back itself or do I wait and see how this pans out ?  


PS: I am quite sure that the pay an APM with my experience receives at my firm is 170,000 - 180,000. Even if it's 160,000 I wouldn't mind much. However, I don't think its fair to only receive appraised pay of 130,000-140,000 (which is a 10% increment over my current comp) that a Business Analyst would receive while doing the work of an APM.

**TL;DR : Do I tell HR about an offer I received 6 months back from another company that was 50% over my current compensation while discussing compensation I would be receiving for a new role I am to move into 2 months later ?**"

They told me they're about to make a decision and they're pretty much done with the interview process.

I had half a day off in august due to bad headache, took paracetamol and it wasn‚Äôt helping so I took half a day off sick to sleep and returned to work the next day. I had two days off in October with a bad sickness bug and two days off in December with covid symptoms (test came back negative). I have also had 4 days dependancy leave, 2 days due to my daughter banging her head and having a concussion and us being in A and E and two days due to her having covid. 

I have not even had a return to work concerning the sickness I had in December but yesterday I got an email saying I am being invited to a hearing next week where if I do not supply a satisfactory explanation for my high levels of absence my employment will be terminated. 

My company uses the Bradford score for sickness and if I‚Äôm correct my score is 40.5 which isn‚Äôt that high? 

I‚Äôm just a bit worried that I will get sacked, and just looking for a bit of insight. It looks like this is a formal meeting as there will be a note taker, is it normal for a company to go straight for a formal meeting? I thought they would have had an informal chat with me first if they considered my absence levels to be high. Also the letter says the concern is high absence levels so will that include the days I‚Äôve had off for dependancy?

726,Been Promised a Promotion Unexpectedly,jobs,"Hi everyone,

I am a senior officer at a semi-governmental institution in which I have been an employee for a little over 5 years now.

Fortunately,   I have been performing very well at my job and have been politically   savvy, gaining the trust, recognition, and admiration of management.

The   thing about this institution is that its employee turnover is very low   and openings for managerial position are few and far between and that   promotions are usually reserved to those who are most senior (there are   several officers who are more senior than I am).

However,   a few days ago after I had discussed something work-related with my   second level manager he voluntarily told me that there might be a team   leader opening that I'm wanted for (in another division which he's not a   part of). A couple of days after that , he told me the same thing.

My response in both instances was thanking him for seeing my potential.

I   really want this promotion but I wonder how should I have responded?   and how should I follow up with him on this to maximize the chances of   realizing the promotion without sounding too needy or lacking   confidence.

Note:  I always try to  keep my expectations low, and this case is no  exception. But the fact  the he voluntarily told me that without me  asking is a sign that this  might be solid. He's been my second level  manager for most of my time  the the org and I know fully well that he's  not a bullshitter."

728,My boss asks me to reprimand my other boss.,jobs,"I work as an secretary at a small professional orchestra. Above me are the two founders of the group, the art director (the de facto big boss, let's call him Director) and the administrative director (let's call him AD). My job is to assist them in whatever works they need done. 

Despite the hierarchy, my role is sometimes seen in the organization as being more important than the AD because he's not a very competent worker. I am often entrusted jobs that technically should be handled by the him. But as an founder, there's still a sense that he's my boss, and the disparity of our salaries also reflects that.

The Director would regularly reprimand the AD for his incompetence in front of me. It's a little awkward, but he's the big boss, so it's not unordinary. But lately, he has started asking me to reprimand the AD for him. He even went as far as to instruct me the exact words he wants me to say. Not as a messenger, but as if those are my own words. 

This is so awkward. Despite the works we actually do, I have always treated the AD as my boss. I told the Director that it's not my place to reprimand a founder, or even a coworker. And the words he put into my mouth would be considered extremely rude coming from me. But he wouldn't take it.  He ensured me that there's a strategic purpose to it. At the end of my protest, he just said ""I'm the boss, just do what I say"".

Just a side note, i kept my job, and in a my junior year, I was promoted to a position of restaurant manager, and I have kept my position while studying at school. (I enjoy both of them equally)

The real question that I need help with is that, I recently was contacted by a company to apply for a position for operational manager; I applied, and had my interview, following which I was offered a job right in my home town with a salary of 90-110k annual with great benefits, and I am still in my third year. 

The thing is, if I finish my degree and try to get a job with it, the best i could get is $45000-$60000 initially. 

So, I am confused what should I do‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to leave my degree incomplete but also, the thought of almost getting payed double right now..

Sorry for this long message, I am not good at writing things in chronological order, I hope it makes sense!

Any help or advice is appreciated!!!"
743,How do I change my career? My life?,jobs,"Hi reddit 

I've been in the restaurant industry for about 13 years now. Started as a cook, have worked in some of the top restaurants of the world. I've run multiple multi million dollar companies. Covid sent me on a tail spin. I ended up line cooking again, and even got married! I'm so happy with my marriage. I love my wife. But my job. Fuck. I hate it. I dread it every day.i just can't seem to get back to the level I was at, and honestly dont really want to. Restaurants feel so negative these days. The service industry seems like a cesspool of drama and bullshit. It hurts to say that. But I'm depressed. I don't want to do it anymore, but I don't know how to change it. I don't know how to get out. :( Any advice?"
744,Employer not accepting at home COVID tests.,jobs,My current GM will not accept at home COVID tests as proof of COVID 19. Many of my coworkers do not have insurance and simply cannot afford to go in a pay for a test.

745,"Am I right to feel upset with my superiors at my job in regards to my current situation, or am I solely to blame?",jobs,"* Around mid-September, I got a job as a Deputy Clerk/Office Assistant for a small Village's municipal government. My goal is to have a career in the public sector, so I was very happy to get this job.
* However, early into my time there, I noticed several issues and problems that I was not made aware of when I interviewed for the position. First, none of the other people working at the Village have been working there more than a year, meaning that no one there really has a lot of experience. Second, many of the previous employees were apparently not very good at their jobs, as things were and still are very disorganized, with everyone scrambling to try and fix things. Finally, there was a recent sidewalk project that ended up costing the Villagers a lot more than what was projected, and the property tax bills also had a significant increase as well, leading to many pissed-off villagers and greatly damaging the trust between the Village and its inhabitants.
* One other issue I would like to note is that, in my opinion, the training I received from the Village Clerk was not very good, as she only really gave me basic verbal instructions about the various tasks my job entailed, without any written instructions or anything. I have literally created pages of instructions and notes on my own in an attempt to improve my performance.
* Despite all of this, I did my best to have a good attitude and do my job well, which I thought I was, as both the Village Clerk and new Village Administrator who was hired back in December both said that I was doing well.
* However, in the past few weeks, things have suddenly taken a complete U-Turn, with both the Clerk and Administrator saying that I am not meeting the performance expectations of the position despite them supposedly trying to make things ""simpler"" for me, and as a result, I have been placed on administrative leave and was forced to turn in my keys.
* To be fair, I have been struggling with creating and posting Village Committee Agendas, which is a big part of my job and the main reason that they are upset with me. But in my defense, there are a few things I would like to point out.

1. Going back to my complaint about the poor training I received, the Clerk only showed me how to create and post agendas once before leaving me on my own.
2. I have suffered from depression and anxiety all of my life, and I recently started taking a new medication which has really helped my depression and energy levels but has caused me to develop sort of a ""brain fog"", by which I mean that I struggle to listen to people and remember what they have told me. Really, I am struggling with remembering things in general. I have made an appointment with my physician to figure this out ASAP.

* **What I Am Upset About**

1. As a result of the aforementioned issues I have, I ended up making several mistakes this week. I talked to the Village Administrator on Tuesday evening, where he basically spent 15 or so minutes chewing me out before asking me what I thought the problem was. I told him how I felt I wasn't properly trained due to the Clerk being so busy with everything else she has been having to do, but he said that that sounded like a cop-out to him. To me, it sounds like he has already decided that everything is my fault, so why did he bother asking me for my opinion in the first place?
2. When I came into work the next day, I saw that he had sent out an email to all of the Village staff and trustees in regards to him deciding to cancel a committee meeting because I did not post the agenda properly. While I can understand that, he went on to say that the reason for the cancelation was because ""the village employee responsible for posting the agenda and maintaining the public's trust in the village failed to do so"". So not only is he throwing me under the bus for the agendas, but now it's apparently my fault that the villagers don't trust the village?
3. Also, about two hours into work on Wednesday, he and the Clerk pull me aside to talk. I had expected this, and I was honest with them about my medication and the steps I have taken to improve. However, neither of them seemed to really care and said that they have decided to place me on administrative leave, as ""the village is trying to restore the people's trust in it, and my failures with the agendas have prevented them from doing that"". Not only do I think that placing me on administrative leave is a major overreaction, but I highly doubt the Villagers care as much about the agendas as they do about the sidewalk payments, property tax increases, and all of the other problems that the village has. I feel like I am basically being made a scapegoat here.
4. Finally, they said that they have talked to me several times about the agendas and that they have done their best to make things ""simpler"" for me. First off, until that meeting, their ""talking to me"" consisted of them making brief comments as I was in the middle of a ton of other stuff, meaning it did not register as something super important to me. Second, even if they have tried to make things easier on me, they never once stopped and asked me what I think would help. If they had, I would have told them I could use some more instructions and guidance to better perform my job.

* **My Questions**

1. Am I right to feel upset with them?
2. How much of what has happened is their fault, and how much of it is mine?
3. Do you think I am being treated unfairly?
4. Depending on whether or not they fire me, what should I do next?"

756,How do you push through?,jobs,"Backstory: I‚Äôve been trying to get a full time job since I graduated college almost 4 years ago now. I‚Äôve been able to get two full time jobs in the past but they were both temporary. So when those ended, I had to work multiple jobs which I hated. So I was so happy to finally get this full time, not temporary job, my first ever. I‚Äôve been working here for 2 weeks.

I also have terrible social anxiety (my whole life) and depression.

My job is essentially a receptionist position but I also help with other things around the office. I‚Äôm the only full time employee and have two bosses, the co-founders of the company. One of them is amazing, super supportive, and kind. The other is a nightmare. Everything I do is wrong. Bad reviews are my fault. I‚Äôm always the bad guy who has to tell the customers if we can‚Äôt see them or if there‚Äôs another problem. 

Story: (warning: boring work stuff)
For example, I had someone call thinking they had an appointment. I went to ask my boss about something else and mentioned the call and was told there was no appointment booked for this person. I called them and let them know but said we‚Äôd be sure to fit them in if we could and had them hold. I went to ask my boss (knowing we did in fact have time to see them) and I was berated for not getting the customers full name, not asking which of our (2) store locations they were coming to, and was told to have them send their confirmation email. I told them to email and they said they changed their minds and no longer wanted to come in. They were upset, of course, because even though they were confirmed, they were being told to prove it and I feel like my boss took this situation out on me and therefore the customer instead of just trusting what I said and fitting them in. 

Conclusion: 
I‚Äôve grown to hate my job and it‚Äôs really only because of my boss. Everything else is fine. But I can‚Äôt imagine having to work here for a year or more. But I feel like if I work there for any less time it won‚Äôt ‚Äúcount‚Äù for my resume. 

How do people deal with this kind of situation? Especially in tiny company settings. How do I make it work (or do I)?"

760,Being given double the work and thinking of quitting,jobs,"I started this job in Oct. 2020 after losing my first job after graduating due to the pandemic. The job is basically just processing invoices and managing orders. One of our team members transferred departments and I was only told the day she transferred so now I have all her workload. My manager is also telling me to process at least 100 orders a day in addition to managing my new tasks. I was unable to hit the 100 target for two days straight. She was pissed at me and kept sent me emails reminding me how little invoices I processed. I tried explaining to her that since I now have double the work I can‚Äôt meet her targets. The next day my manager assigns me over 100 cases on salesforce herself and tells me finish them before the end of the day. I stayed up till 1 am finishing everything. This entire week I‚Äôve worked overtime while making shit money. 

My coworkers are also getting double the work and one even called me to vent. During the call she slipped how much she makes, which I had no idea. Now I find out that I‚Äôm one of the lowest paid in the entire company. I‚Äôm making 35k after taxes. During my chat with the coworker she suggested we go together and ask for a pay rise or less work. But honestly I don‚Äôt see the point.

762,"24F, BA in Educational Studies. I have been applying to jobs but I feel like my job search is going nowhere.",jobs,"Hello!, 

I am starting to get very antsy and nervous about my future. I graduated in February of 2021 with an education degree and got my first teaching job right away. I live in a state with crazy teacher shortages so I was able to get a job fairly quickly. I quickly realized that teaching wasn‚Äôt for me and quit. The pandemic didn‚Äôt help at all. After that I got a baking job but after suffering a knee injury and my job not believing me, I decided it‚Äôd be best to quit and look for jobs that pay more and that I can actually advance in. I enjoyed the baking gig but it was a very catty environment and my mental health was suffering. Especially because I was living paycheck to paycheck with the measly pay they gave me. 

For the last month, I‚Äôve been applying to any and every job that I am qualified for and under-qualified for. Yet, I haven‚Äôt been receiving interview requests like I used to before the pandemic. I had two interviews and both asked for 5 professional references (I only have four) AND the pay was incredibly low. One was for $15 and the other one was for $12. I really don‚Äôt want to go back to retail and food service. The only reason I got my degree is because I thought that I can secure a job that pays at least $38,000 a year. I didn‚Äôt even want to be a teacher. I am unsure of what I want to be. 

I am drowning in debt and can‚Äôt pay my half of the rent. I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a future for me and job hunting has started giving me anxiety. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I applied to jobs on Indeed, Zip Recruiter, and LinkedIn. I cannot relocate for about a year due to my lease. The city I live in is super small and the job listings are minimal. I wanted to go back to school but I owe money to previous schools and need to pay them back before I can attend again. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? I don‚Äôt even know how I will survive next month because my credit cards are almost maxed out.

I am comfortable in my job, but the work is not really engaging (a lot of downtime) and I‚Äôve been seeing all my college peers find better jobs (60k+, remote, larger companies).

I am a designer, and they definitely had a more profit focused business structure than I was used to, but thought it would be interesting. In the past I have worked for companies that prioritized design, but we were always struggling to make ends meet.

So a few months in, they did some unethical stuff that I am uncomfortable with, and my working experience has been really stressful in general. It is just not the right fit.

No big deal, I am far enough in my career to find another position. Without even updating my resume I got 2 offers from previous contacts. Problem is, my current bosses are kind of intense and I have seen them vindictive. Usually I would be like ""thanks for the opportunity, you guys are great, but I don't think I am the best fit... "" but I also know they are really busy and will be angry. The last guy who quit, they tried to get him fired at his new position by calling his new boss and telling them every little thing he did wrong.

I guess I am trying to figure out a way to leave without totally stepping on a landmine. I do need to have surgery and I was planning to schedule it between this job and the next.

This is due to a weird policy in my company that prevents giving return offers to interns unless they have graduation certifications. Fast forward two months after the end of my internship, the Head of Design reached back out to me another time by emailing and encouraging me to reapply when I graduate (which is this May 2022). The thing that I find iffy here is that the Head of Design only says this over an email. 

I really want to rejoin to their design team because I honestly had a blast working with them. They are great and fun people and would always take time to check in on me. Should I keep my hopes up of returning or should I look for other opportunities because there's a high chance that they won't offer me the position?"

Yearly reviews are handled by HR so its convenient for my boss not to get confrontational regarding pay. I've expressed my displeasure with my salary the past few years to HR and I don't know how much of that reaches my bosses ears. I got a bit of a bump higher than what they originally offered one year and better bonuses the second year but because of covid I preferred working from home for the experience and not having to deal with a job search even though I remained underpaid by market standards. Salaries have blown up the past 2 years as has housing, groceries and everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it bluntly, I'm underpaid compared to market average and I want to attempt getting my worth before I start looking for a new job, there is no higher role I can advance to as I am working directly under my boss and have several people working in my team, I want to give this a fair shot because I enjoy my work and I would like to see some of the ongoing projects through, but I don't enjoy making .70 cents to the dollar doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I put together some arguments for my case as well as research regarding salaries in the market and even what some competent people who have left the business are currently making in their new roles.

Yearly review is in about 3 weeks, and I feel like HR will be useless or yet again meet me 1/3 of the way at lest so I want to have a discussion directly with my boss. Should I:

1. wait and see what they say at review then approach my boss for a discussion afterwards?

2. ask my boss to have a sit down and discuss my future with the company before the review?

3. Avoid a direct confrontation and try to maximize my argument in writing?

778,The institution where I work is having a surge in covid and the main manager of the establishment is currently on vacation in Mexico.,jobs,"I don't know how much more I can take of this society. My job is literally a secretary that could 100% be worked from home, but we have to come into the office every day even though we have about 500 employees testing positive since Christmas break. All required to wear n95s. While our company is struggling to keep up the pace, instead of trying to get us to work from home, manager lady is vacationing in Mexico. How ass backwards is shit now and days? Who would even feel comfortable doing such a dumb ass thing right now mid winter peak pandemic to go on vacation to Mexico? While all of us are trying hard not to catch this shit at work? 

I'm so over this. Everyone only cares about themselves and because we as humans can't seem to care for our fellow man, we're gonna be our own downfall. And honestly we deserve it. This pandemic should've been the jump start to businesses recognizing that MOST jobs can be worked remotely, but nah who else is gonna fund Mrs. Managers sweet 2 week vacation. Un fucking believable."
779,Keep your chin up folks!,jobs,"Last year I had put in my 2 weeks at McDonalds after I felt like I had hit a wall there due to some personal issues going on with my life. After a slow down at my current job I reapplied and was told once they saw it was me the interview was a formality at that point. I had no idea I had actually did such a good job there either, because apparently I was still in the system 4 months later, and they told me I can start tomorrow. It made me feel great to actually hear this and I even told my boss thank you very much. So going to give them by best performance as before too. Remember if you can make your bosses laugh it can go a long way, even more so if you can get the job done!"

783,Confused what to do next‚Ä¶,jobs,"This week has been very stressful for me as I just realised that I need to start looking for another job as a back-up in case things go south in the startup I work for‚Ä¶ i love what I do but I would like some stability in my career path. 

I applied to one job, as I think my experiences really align with the position, and the company is also in the same industry (edtech). I am also looking at other companies that align with my interests, to really narrow my search.

Now, idk if what I‚Äôm doing is right or wrong. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe in my company but I am worried if things go south when we start fundraising.

I really would like to learn more, do more, and make more impact in my work. So far I‚Äôm achieving that with my position but i dont know if that is even enough for when I continue sending out applications. I also know that rejections are inevitable, as much as they are soul-crushing. 

Anyone every felt like this? Is what I‚Äôm doing wrong? Any thoughts or words wisdom?"
784,Pattern where I become unhappy at work after less than a year,jobs,"I‚Äôm in a weird pattern: after about six months in every job I have I start to get super stressed and want to flame out/leave. Six months is generally the point where my employer starts to see how capable I am. They start to overload me with work outside of my scope and tease at promotion opportunities in the future. The promotion never comes, I get resentful and burnt out, then I leave. 

I would like to stop this pattern and need a shift in perspective. I am a smart and capable worker. I always do way more than is expected of me and I do an amazing job. I think it‚Äôs interesting to learn about stuff. I don‚Äôt *want* a promotion per se, but I understand I need to progress professionally as I get older. I don‚Äôt feel especially connected to my employer now that I‚Äôm remote which is not helping. 

Have you experienced this? How did you shift your perspective? I can‚Äôt keep job hopping."

Also they mentioned training may be remote or in the office, this will depend on cdc guidelines. I was hoping this would be more of a remote/hybrid position but I was told that eventually CS wants everyone to integrate back to a physical workplace.
Also they mentioned after I‚Äôm done with my 10 week training that I would have to bid on my work hours-meaning they would give me possible schedules and I would have to rank them based on my preference and I could possibly get a graveyard type shift. This makes me extremely nervous not knowing what my hours would be until after training. Any advice?"

TLDR: I was let go from my last job for a dumb reason that was not performance related but did not cause any harm to anyone, including my boss. After many months of job searching, I got an offer for a new job but during the interview, I found out that my new boss is FRIENDS with my old boss! 

What should I do?? I thought about this  and came up with the following options: 
a.  not talk about it and accept offer and pray background check clears

791,Negotiated a raise and title change at my first job out of college during my 6 month review,jobs,"I had a plan from the beginning. I worked my ass off to learn everything as fast as I could. I showed up early every day, worked late, turned in assignments ASAP, led an automation project, implemented a new reporting system. I got recognition from my bosses bosses &amp; his boss 3 months in. As soon as I received that email, I sat down w my boss, pretending I was still worried about my performance until she told me I was doing great, and after she was done I asked to work from home a few days a week and have a book + certification paid for, so I could ‚Äúfeel more confident about the quality of my work‚Äù. Both were granted to me. Now I knew that the company valued me and there is use in continuing to work hard. I took on a lot of new assignments, but from November to December I lowered my work ethic. I would mysteriously leave early, started being very active on LinkedIn and would ‚Äúforget‚Äù to respond to emails so they thought I was overwhelmed w work/not as passionate about the job anymore. At my 6 month review this week, I let my boss sing my praises. She was very excited to announce that I was eligible for the 2% inflation raise. Then I let her know that I see 5-6 new job postings for similar roles in my area, and that as much as I love working here and am grateful for all the opportunities, my research showed that I was being undervalued and that was leading me to become a lot less motivated than I was before and I didn‚Äôt want to be tempted to apply and mentioned the salary ranges. She was shocked and seemed like she did not agree and was surprised that I even asked and said she would look into it. I worked more closely with her boss, who knew more about my work ethic and skills. I was kind of upset with her reaction, so when she offered to buy us all lunch I hit her with a ‚Äúno thanks, I had a full breakfast‚Äù. She pulled me into a conference room and told me she had already talked to her boss about my request. The next morning I got a call from her boss offering me a $12k salary increase and a title change. I am going to ask for more, but I just wanted to let you guys know that this worked for me and I plan on doing it again once I move to another company and it‚Äôs always worth a try."

It‚Äôs a pretty big company and I didn‚Äôt ask about payday but it was inadvertently mentioned that the pay period started Monday, the same day I started. Even though it‚Äôs salary, we clock in. 

I was fine with that. I currently have another full time contract job that pays weekly and I don‚Äôt really hurt for cash at the moment. I woke up today and noticed a significant deposit in my account. It was a direct deposit from the company. I have not worked a full pay period but they also don‚Äôt seem like the type of people to make mistakes, especially with money (it‚Äôs a financial company). 

HR rep wasn‚Äôt in today but I feel like I should ask about it. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt a mistake but if it was, I would rather not hide anything. I feel like I should come clean and check in case it was an error but sometimes I‚Äôm too honest and it bites me in the ass.

I also share my car with my family, so I would have to rely on the transit bus sometimes, which takes just over 2 hours to get there. And I am really not in a position to relocate.

I haven't responded to the email yet as I feel really conflicted. Data Analytics has been one of my most wanted career fields (the other being UX Design), and I have been actively looking for a position. But I am not sure if the time to commute vs the salary will be worth it. Everything else about the company, the culture, the benefit, etc seems great.

Recruiter reached out for a position at Google! Exciting, right?

me: is this a contract role, contract-to-hire, or direct FTE?

recruiter: this is a contract position with Google, starting at 1 year with potential to extend up to an additional year and/or convert to FTE. It is paid hourly W2/HR. is this something you're interested in?

me: thanks for the details. Would I  be an official Google employee? And since it's hourly, are there benefits?

recruiter: You would be an employee of my contracting company, working at Google. For resume and LI purposes, you can *mention* Google as your end client but have to associate it with ""via contractor"" or ""contract""."
808,Feeling anxious over lack of work in first two weeks of new job.,jobs,"So I started a new job at a new company two weeks ago. 

It's a nice pay raise in comparison to my old job, better benefits as well. So I want to make a good impression, at least initially during the probation period. 

But the problem is that there's barely any work for me to do in the first two weeks. I pretty much have one daily task to do so far, but I picked up quick on it and can complete it relatively fast and accurately. So the rest of the work days I'm just trying to find stuff to show my value and be as productive as possible. But it's hard, I'm getting to the point of just creating a operating procedure manual of the daily task I've been doing. 

I talked to my manager about it and he said it's kind of expected to be slow the first two weeks since everyone else in the department was pretty much too busy to do training with me. But by next month I'll be assigned more tasks. So that makes me feel a bit more at ease. 

But I still feel anxious during the day right now when pretty much everyone else in the department is working to the bone and I'm just trying to things to do to get through the workday.

Can anyone else relate?"

I was a police dispatcher for 3 years and she said that doesn‚Äôt count. The other jobs I had include:

Operations Supervisor- present 1 year 5 months, I supervise truck drivers and work on reports that show any reasons why the trips were delayed or uncovered. 

Background Investigator 1yr, 9 months - Basically conducting background checks on workers compensation claimants. Planning analysis? I helped to plan the best course of action for surveillance based on what I find in the background checks.

Corporate Investigation- 3 months Analyze data to find internal theft (I considered that personnel analysis). I also responded to alarms in the stores by viewing the cameras and calling the police.

810,Where are the entry level jobs?,jobs,"I'm looking for jobs on LinkedIn and filtering by ""entry level.""

Thanks for your help. I appreciate you all."
817,A Lot of Red Flags at New Job - What would you do?,jobs,"So I (26F) got a new job back in November. I was really excited because this would be a transition from a call center position and right to a mid-corporate level position. I essentially make sure all of the products that we manufacture are compliant with the laws from the markets in which we sell. I thought this was a cool opportunity to expand my career experience to climb to a better position later.

In my interview, it seemed like a legit position and we were all excited. See, I have worked in many different places and office spaces but I have never seen a place like this. First of all, I have only seen my supervisor (30ish F) physically 3 times and we barely speak. My coworker (50s F) is training me and delegating tasks but my supervisor probably has no idea what the hell I am doing most days. Ironically enough she was supposed to give me a performance review (how?). From day one my co-worker has complained about how shitty the job is, trying to warn me about the office politics and she makes it seem that everyone is fighting for a power position here. Like every department is at war and if you mess up, they will rain hellfire onto you. ""We can never be wrong"". A lot of the people here actually don't seem that way but I don't know if it's cause I am being naive or not. There is a sense of passive-aggressiveness though sometimes.

Anyways this co-worker tells me all kinds of shit. Like how the supervisor for the department, the one that left before I was hired, was bullied by my current supervisor, so bad that she ended up on stress leave and eventually quit. She also quit because of the possible legal issues that may arise from the decisions made by management, and she was signing stuff for the department. She did not want to be associated with the company on that premise as well. My coworker also said that someone knows some shady financial stuff (this is sensitive stuff, I am scared talking about it on here, hence the missing details). She also said that our department is viewed as an advisory one, but we deal with the law. She hates the chain of command in executing projects and approvals for things because sometimes my supervisor doesn't answer at all. Or they say no to something that can be really bad later if they don't deal with it now such as fines. She said they would never have a meeting with us discussing new product launches because were administrators. Like we can't even get mail from our second office in another country but I am never allowed to reach out to anybody to suggest how to deal with it.

In regards to the legality of things, I have to sign affidavits with certain law agencies about the reports we are required to send them. The issue is a lot of the information we provide is incomplete and it feels like we're cutting corners when it comes to that. I don't want to sign anything and have the responsibility on my head in case anything goes down.

I am still within the probationary period, only been here 2 months. I thought I did my research about this company but it was waaayyy worse than I expected. I expected a job where I did product compliance and worked with the entire staff to meet the goal of selling this shit, but instead, as my coworker put it, it's an ego-pissing contest. I have to say though, most of this information is coming from the co-worker. She asked for me to be hired, I just don't get how complaining and fear-mongering this position makes me want to work here. My mom told me to record everything and after my probation period talk to HR. She says she doesn't have a good feeling about my co-worker but they have been through a lot in the last year. With the workload and losing their partner to COVID, she may just be jaded. I feel for her though, that's really rough to experience that and then your supervisor quits leaving you to their bully.

I don't want to undermine anybody and I could give a flying poo if you're a VP or CFO or whatever. I just want to work, get experience, get paid, and go home. That seems to be a tall order with all this supposed high school drama. So what should I do? Do I believe the co-worker? Do I stay and keep my head low? Is it bad to leave the job in the probationary period cause of all that I listed? Are all offices actually like this?

Also, as an employer would you not hire me cause of how long I stayed, despite all the issues? If I told you this is why I am looking for a new job, would I have a chance?

TL;DR Co-worker tells me about how bad the company is run, with supervisor not being there or responsive. Also about the office politics undermining certain tasks that need to be completed. Should I stay or go? Do I believe them?"

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where we can no longer afford to stay in our apartment and so we‚Äôve decided to stay with his family about 2 hours away. The job we have offers good benefits and such, we were just already in a hole and weren‚Äôt in a situation where we could dig ourselves out of it. We didn‚Äôt find out that we would have to move until this week but we communicated with our manager the day we found out and told him the next day that our only option was to move and transfer to another location where we are moving. You could tell by the tone in his voice that he was frustrated that we didn‚Äôt give a 2 weeks notice, I get it, but life happens and we didn‚Äôt have any clue and told him as soon as we knew. We‚Äôre getting evicted and literally have a week and a half to get affairs in order. Fast forward to today, we‚Äôre about 6 days from moving day. I called the other location this morning and they still haven‚Äôt heard from him about our transfer but scheduled a meeting with us once we‚Äôre in town anyway. Our manager approached our boyfriend and told him that he can‚Äôt give him days off and that we needs to work our shifts for the following 2 weeks or find covers. I get that we didn‚Äôt give adequate notices but we gave the soonest we could.

827,I screwed up big time,jobs,So I work remote helpdesk and occasionally we get phone calls from users. A coworker got a call and she was really confused. We use teams to communicate so I asked her to give me the call. The user was confused but I was able to help them out in a jiffy. My direct manager saw and called me on teams. He asked me how many times did I ask people to give me calls and then some. The job isn't hard just involves a set of steps. He told me I wasn't in trouble but two people usually give me their calls when I'm working the helpdesk phones. I was only trying to help out but now I feel like either me or my coworkers are in trouble. What can I do in this situation?

844,question about what jobs to search for,jobs,"So I recently graduated with a BS in business. Problem is due to going to school online(due to some personal issues at the time) and being an immigrant(so no long standing network system) and not having worked throughout school, my networking is 0, so just someone offering me a job is out of the question. 


However when I do search for jobs online, all I'm finding is commission sales stuff(not what I'm looking for) or other entry level stuff that is paying less than mcdonalds. Anything that even pays a liveable wage wants 10+ years of experience. 


What are some good jobs to look out for as a recent grad with a BS in Business and little experience?"
845,"A coworker told me he got a bonus, I told him I got a raise + bonus, and he's been noticeably colder and harder to work with.",jobs,"I thought I knew it already, but I guess you can't really trust the people you think you can trust. Stupid me of to have shared the info with him, I know. But it is what it is, and I just wanted to share my story.

This is my first real job out of college and I've been here for 5 years now. What's funny is this same coworker was teaching me on office etiquette and general American office culture, since I was from out of the country. One of the things he told me was to avoid talking about salaries, not because management doesn't like it, but because it could cause friction between colleagues. 

We've developed a good professional relationship throughout the years, often collaborating on many projects, filling in for each other when the other is sick/on vacation, and just general looking out for each. I eventually shared my salary with him but at the time I was making less than he was, and he still continued being the reliable coworker. That is until about 4 weeks ago, when my boss gave me a raise and a bonus, and now I'm making more than said coworker. 

He came up to me later on and say ""you got a bonus *too* didn't you?"" and almost laughing. and I lied and said no, and he jokingly said ""you're lying"" and I couldn't keep a straight face and blew my cover. I said ""yeah, \_\_\_ is leaving and I'll be transitioning out of this role for their role"" Knowing that our other colleague's job was higher ranked than mine, he asked ""I hope you're getting a raise?"" and I just smiled and he said ""good for you!""

But the very next week, it's like he would no longer want to help. All of a sudden not as motivated as he once was, is harder to work with, harder to ask to split certain projects, more dismissive, gives less input and opinions for stuff we used to collaborate effortless on, quick to say ""i dont care its up to you."" He also no longer says  yes to me when I ask him for something he used (like to run a report, look into an account) unless I explicitly say ""I'm asking you because &lt;boss's name&gt; asked me to ask you.""

Although it's a gut feeling, I am fairly confident he's upset that I got a raise + bonus, and he just got a a bonus. He's jealous and maybe feels that he was the one who deserved the ""promotion."" But what's funny is he never really wanted that role and we even spoke about it when we had our suspicions that that person was leaving. He was always one to not want to attend company outings or drinks, but hated it when no one invited him - he was just quirky like that. I also knew he didn't want the job of the person who was leaving, which confuses me why he would be bitter that I'm the one moving up making more money in exchange for more work, when he and I both know he would have turned down the opportunity if it was given to him. He and I were both hardworking, but I have been more keen to say yes to the boss than he was - be it to work on weekends, stay late, work through lunch, etc.  He is hardworking, I wont deny it, but I am also not surprised why the boss picked me over him. 

I've always known that money can corrupt relationships, especially when I hear of  familiy fights when they're dealing with splitting wills and estate of their late family members.  But I never really experienced it til now. I know he's not family but he sure **was** a good coworker to work with."

848,Is an Art career even obtainable these days?,jobs,"(**TLDR at bottom**) 
I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôve done YEARS of Face Painting work (2011-2020), designed silly coloring pages for a kids classroom, created classroom door decor for multiple schools, have, currently, a side hustle of freelance pornography ‚Äúcutesy‚Äù art, have created activities for at-risk foster teens and they absolutely loved how I wouldn‚Äôt infantilize them like other adults would, and have a constantly creative busting mind. 


I love being creative. I am not great at, lets say, graphic design like a fancy logo or something, but I have skills. But‚Ä¶ All these experiences were under the table. At best I have some old pictures as proof of my earlier classroom work but these days only the pornography earns me any side money/show my newly improved skills. (I really only have the skills to charge about $60 tops.) 


I love being creative. Its in my blood. These 9-5 jobs are hell and I don‚Äôt have a degree in anything so I am stuck in entry level limbo in a town that pays $15 an hour when cost of living is $27+ an hour. I can‚Äôt exactly show off my digital NSFW art in my portfolio, I assume, and don‚Äôt really have the time to start busting my ass for hours to make new SFW pieces for free when I barely have time after work to relax before I Have to get some sleep. 

So I have skills but am at ground zero. Art, while revered highly in my town if you are a mural wall painter, is not profitable in the areas I am looking. No physical place, here, has a need for a creative mind. They need wage slaves and it‚Äôs not profitable. 

So I am trying to look for remote work. I have asthma and despite being fully vaccinated, have had covid a few times and I would prefer to stay safely indoors. 

I know of ‚ÄúFivver‚Äù and some other hustle sites but I really want a career. Maybe helping make children‚Äôs books! Maybe finding a paying art degree class! 

**TLDR:**

I don‚Äôt know whats out there but growing up as an artist, I have stifled myself for years because I was always told my art would never pay the bills. I want to prove everyone wrong. I want to contribute to the world with my silly drawings. 

Please help me make that a reality with absolutely any advice you may have and job titles I could look up. Thank you for your time."

I describe that let's say in my firm managers are responsible for managing their teams, organising reviews, while HR takes care of the administrative work etc.
That we are provided with a lot of education content from the headquartered, we have big international company reviews 4 times a year and so one. No details on any of it, no names.

Pretty much the information I take are from either open sources, common knowledgeable, or can be found on LinkedIn.

Then I have to describe communication channels. I basically say we use Outlook and Teams, sometimes WhatsApp locally. And that we use mails as a most common form of communication.

Now, I want to describe the Intranet system we have. Can I do that?

I want to say:
""Our Intranet is called Intra'[company name] and there we have Our Group - describes mission, committments of the groupe, Workplace, My [Company Name] - contains HR and practical information for employees, Documents - intro documents for each department, Apps - list of internal systems we use""

I now know this to be a profound mistake and that there was no point in fudging the numbers especially since I was a freelancer all those years. Earlier in my career I had trouble getting work so at the time it seemed important to show that I was continuously working.

HR is asking me to draft a letter to just explain the inconsistencies so they have something on record. The HR rep. ""assured me"" that this wasn't doom and gloom but I have my doubts. 

I have a great working relationship with my team and my manager so I can see them not being too concerned especially since I've been performing well at work. I'm concerned about what HR might do in response.

Am I Being Naive Turning It Down?",jobs,"I went through an interview process with a competitor in November/December for a role, and was given an impressive offer last Wednesday that is nearly 50% above my current salary. While the money would be great, I'm not a huge fan of the company's product, nor the daily responsibilities this role would entail. Truthfully, I don't think I would be good at it, and while I'm being underpaid currently I don't \*hate\* my current daily work. Another obstacle is that since the new year, three of my absolute ""dream"" companies have reached out to begin interview processes with them, for roles that would be a better fit.

Unfortunately the processes are not in final rounds yet. I know I can't accept this job offer and then rescind if I got my dream offer at one of these (it's a niche industry), so given my deadline of EOD... I believe I am rejecting this offer. I feel so scared and sort of stupid for leaving this amount of money on the table, especially if at the end of the day, I end up with zero offers from the other opportunities. I'm a little traumatized by the previous rejections I've gotten for opportunities that seemed so hopeful.

864,A very reputable digital agency i got interviewed for offered me a position and half the salary for what that role typically receives.,jobs,"I‚Äôm in a bit of a rut here. I was unemployed up till 2 months ago. I got interviewed to work with a local agency (let‚Äôs call it agency A) in my hometown. The company has a decent selection of UX-creative-digital and social retainers from 3 clients who happen to be international players in the health domain. A few other small ad-hoc/one time projects here and there also popped up since I‚Äôve joined. Suffice to say, they‚Äôre doing ‚Äúokay‚Äù. 

The issue is im still looking for another opportunity out there. And Im leaning more towards agencies than client side 1. because of the money 2. the fact I could convince them of joining as a ‚Äúcreative or digital partner‚Äù instead of your typical 9 to 5 employee. After 15 years of working for random companies, some good, some average some worse than Lucifers hell hole ‚Äî ex tiktok btw, and yeah they‚Äôre sh*t too. I‚Äôve got stories but that‚Äôs for another day, I believe I‚Äôm entitled to some fair compensation. 

Long story short, I got shortlisted and offered to work for a design thinking/creative agency which happened to be big‚Äî think Y&amp;R or Leo. 

The issue here is they got back to me and offered me literally half of the salary for the role that I got shortlisted for. I‚Äôm having mixed emotions of anger, hate, resentment and bitterness, and all of this because I know when I went through their 5 round interview that they have a massive client in the hospitality sector (it‚Äôs a group) and the retainer is for 2 years. They‚Äôre hiring two people, one is a senior head of marketing (which is what I‚Äôm selected for) and the other is a junior.

I have not responded to the email yet. I don‚Äôt even know how in god‚Äôs name am I going to start reasoning with them that I‚Äôm not worth half of my market value with that silly offer. I would want to work with them but not for that amount of money, I don‚Äôt want anymore mental abuse and long working hours and overburdening multidisciplinary roles. Been there, done that.

867,How Should I Respond to a Promise of a Promotion?,jobs," 

Hi everyone,

I am a senior officer at a semi-governmental institution in which I have been an employee for a little over 5 years now.

Fortunately,  I have been performing very well at my job and have been politically  savvy, gaining the trust, recognition, and admiration of management.

The  thing about this institution is that its employee turnover is very low  and openings for managerial position are few and far between and that  promotions are usually reserved to those who are most senior (there are  several officers who are more senior than I am).

However,  a few days ago after I had discussed something work-related with my  second level manager he voluntarily told me that there might be a team  leader opening that I'm wanted for (in another division which he's not a  part of). A couple of days after that , he told me the same thing.

My response in both instances was thanking him for seeing my potential.

I  really want this promotion but I wonder how should I have responded?  and how should I follow up with him on this to maximize the chances of  realizing the promotion without sounding too needy or lacking  confidence.

Note:  I always try to keep my expectations low, and this case is no  exception. But the fact the he voluntarily told me that without me  asking is a sign that this might be solid.

869,Struggling with my new job. Will my old one take me back?,jobs,"TLDR: Realising my new job is just too much for me. Old place is hiring again so should I ask my manager if I can come back? Old place is much closer to home and the hours are more suited to me.


(24F) I started as a trainee lecturer in October but I'm really struggling with it and I'm constantly exhausted (I have chronic fatigue and pain anyway :/) My reviews at work have been good but I'm just not happy. If I leave, my notice period is 2 months as the students can't be left without a lecturer for too long.

My old place is hiring again for pretty much the same position that I used to do. I was there 7 months and my manager was very pleasant with me when I left, saying that if I wanted to come back I could.
My old job was much closer to home with a better work-life balance although was more physical and difficult for me with my health issues. This new one is much further away but mentally exhausting so whichever way I go, I'll still be tired!

Should I ask my old manager if I should apply and that I'm just struggling too much in my current position?"
870,Is this a toxic work environment?,jobs,"I work as a copywriter for a communication agency, I've been receiving weird vibes lately and I'd like to have an outside perspective on this. Things that make me go hmmm:

1. They constantly stress this rhetoric of ""family, not just a workplace‚Äù. Everyone is everyone else's friend, meetings are disguised as get togethers as an excuse to be organized on time off (lunch break)

2. Overtime isn't paid and everyone is at least okay with it, if not actively trying to justify it (""if we end up working overtime it's because we weren't good enough at finishing work on time"")

3. Pay rises are given in form of expense account

4. I've been denied temporary full remote I had asked due to personal complications after being told it would have been okay as long as it was temporary (nothing written to prove what they had told me)

5. Pay levels vary significantly among employees even if they have similar roles and similar experience and there's a pattern of women being paid less than men

Had to scramble and finish my degree without internship.

873,What company to pick? Need a suggestion,jobs,"Hi, everyone. I try to enter the field related to my educational background. So far, the job search has resulted in a few potential possibilities. However, I am no very sure any of these options is a good choice yet. The options are.:

**Company 1** \[larger company\]

Relevant role | Relocation (salary cut upon choice to stay in my hometown) | Manager seems disinterested and unmotivated to communicate information

Less relevant role

Requires learning new skills with a mentor | No internship, just trial and learning for 3 months | Offer almost a minimum wage | No relocation required | Manager seems more engaged

**Company 2** \[smaller company\]

Relevant role | Relocation | Interviewed with VP and hiring manager | Accepted proposed salary range | Hiring manager ghosted | Introduced a long-ass intrusive personality test that put me off guard

**Company 3** \[smaller company\]

Relevant role | Relocation | Interview was ok | Ghosted after salary range proposal

**Company 4** \[smaller company\]

Relevant role | Relocation | Interview was very informative| Backed off after salary range proposal

**Company 5** \[smaller company\]

Relevant role | Relocation | A smooth phone interview | Porposed live interview | Ghosted after I explained that I cannot show up next morning.

Another option: Move on and continue jon search.

What would you do if there were only these options to work out for a possible offer?"
874,Been a restaurant worker my whole career. Shifting to more typical sales/manager roles - what do I need to know?,jobs,"Shifting this here as this was suggested to be a better place to post 

This is a bit of a broad question, but I'm already noticing applications are a whole different world than what I'm used to?I'm used to no wage discussions because its always at the floor, scheduling is 50/50, and there's no benefits typically. Do more ""professional"" interviews still have humor as a good tool, or is strict professional manners at all times important? Looking at more traditional jobs, how does one negotiate benefits/wages/schedules in more traditional company settings? I've done a bit of hunting through other threads but getting this more condensed and specific would be helpful.  Other misc questions are things like: are these kinds of jobs also expected to be 24/7 busywork? A lifetime of no breaks, lunches, and ‚Äúif you have time to lean you have time to clean BS‚Äù has skewed my sense of normal a lot probably. 

Are benefits included in salary? 401k is important for my long-term since I dont have one (32m, I know the gist of max this as much as my income allows for immediately), but what else is important?

Is off the clock work ""expected"" on hourly or salary? I just don't even know where to begin on haggling for these things in how weird the job market is right now. I can interview fairly well off a strong customer service background and naturally high communication, but is my  BS in Psychology  worth anything past getting me qualified? High GRE scores? (Gotta make that top 8% in verbal reasoning useful somewhere)

The point of this shift is to get out of a god-awful industry that's collapsing, but mostly to have secure financial bases. I'm looking at generally shifts that are going to be doubling my current income even on the low end, so my current plan is to pay off undergrad debt and build my 3-5 months of expenses in savings. Just looking to capitalize on how desperate a lot of companies are for people currently. I have no real issues jumping ship but would like to avoid that as needed."
875,I feel very behind in my career,jobs,"I feel like I'm very far behind.

 I graduated and have a Business Administration degree with an accounting major. Soon after graduating, I found my first job in a big health insurance company in my country. I liked my job there, although the pay was low (started at $8.72 an hour. When I left, it was $10 because people kept leaving since the pay was too low), it had great benefits and I liked my coworkers.

I stayed there for 1.7 years. It was a simple job, focusing mainly on accounts reconciliations and identifying discrepancies. It was very different from everything I learned in college since I didn't deal with T accounts, Financial Statements, or even journal entries. I did prepare account statements, ran other reports and analized a lot of information, but I didn't do what most people do when they think of accounting.

I had to leave my job because of health proplems during the pandemic, and even had to move to Florida because of this and other issues that came to play. I took it as a challenge to better myself and break out of my comfort zone. I interviewed at the beginning of December for a job, and started it last week. We're still in training and I'm only a temp, but I see that it's a promising company.

However, when I see how much my friends that studied the same thing have progressed, I feel like I'm far behind. I don't know if I need to be more picky when finding a job or what.

I did interview for some better paying positions than the one I have now, but I got rejected because I didn't have experience with posting journal entries or dealing with a lot of invoices. That's why even if this job doesn't pay what I want it to, I will try my best to soak up all the necessary information.

It just feel so far behind. My friend, who moved to this same state a year and a half ago and graduated the same time as I did already earns $17k more than I will in a year, all from great companies with great reviews. She recently got that spot and I am so happy for her, but it left me wondering if I'm doing something wrong? Because I see other people I studied with progressing, I feel like I'm way behind than anyone else.

I feel like I'm a failure as an accountant who, after two years of graduation, hasn't even worked with those type of things to get enough experience and earn enough to live. I come from a spanish speaking country and, although I am bilingual, I'm still getting used to the lingo and change of terminiology in this new company. I am grateful for it, but I feel like I am so far behind and I don't know what else to do."

I just need to shadow her for a while and I've been asking her if i can shadow her. She doesn't call me when she's going (i dont know if shes going to restroom or to wherever she wants to go so i cant just follow her whenever she stand from her table), she doesn't look at me when she talks to me, she doesn't say hi. When i say thank u she ignores it. I dont expect anything in return honestly so idc if she ignores my hi or thank u. I'm just trying to show my point. When we were in a meeting, she address me to my boss.. like oh she doesn't have it yet? Or oh she needs to do this... when I'm there in the meeting with them..its just weird not being addressed...

Is this normal? Is she being shy or what? Both of us are in se√±ior level so that's why i was expecting more professionalism than this..... all i felt is that I'm getting avoided and not getting any help. Idk what to do..

Any advice guys? Greatly appreciate it..thanks!"

But instead of applying the market increase to my promotion rate, they applied it to the pay rate I was making BEFORE I got my promotion.

887,False advertising or what?,jobs,
888,When/how to follow up with HR about an interview that hasn't been scheduled yet,jobs,"Hello, first time poster on r/jobs but I've been lurking ever since I started applying. Just looking for some advice here. The first job I applied to is an engineering job at a small company working in my dream field. One relevant bit of information is that the job listing has been posted on their website since before Thanksgiving at least, since that is when I first saw it. Therefore my expectations were low that they were still hiring for the position even considering they are a very small company and the job was not advertised for anywhere so perhaps they didn't receive a ton of applications.

The timeline of my interaction with this company has been this:

**Monday, January 3:** Send my resume and cover letter to the HR contact listed on their website along with a brief note.

**January 3 - January 6:** Hear nothing from the HR contact.

**Thursday, January 6:** Reach out to the president of the company and an engineer on staff via their company email addresses (made public on their website) and inquire about the status of the position (whether they are still hiring) and note that I sent my applications to the HR contact.

**January 6 - January 10:** Never received a response from anyone regarding the emails I sent, weekend goes by.

**Monday, January 10:** Decide to make one last effort since this again is a company that I really want to work for in my dream field and I want to do as much as I can to help myself. So, I call the president's work phone number (also made public) and leave a voicemail message saying I applied, inquiring about the status of the job, reaffirming my interest, and leave my cell phone number.

**Tuesday, January 11:** I get a text to my cell phone number in the morning from the president saying that the HR contact is trying to set up a phone interview with me and that he has been on a project in Vietnam so he has had limited availability. The time in Vietnam is 12 hours opposite of my time, FYI. We go back and forth for a bit and he says that HR contact will contact me via email.

Later that day I get an email from the HR contact asking about my availability. The email was very short, basically just that single question saying that we can set up a phone interview. I respond with my availability, basically saying I'm available weekdays at certain times but that if those times don't work I can schedule around a time that works for her.

**January 11 - January 14:** Nothing yet.

The HR contact has yet to reply to my email where I provided my availability to actually schedule the phone interview.

What should I do in this instance? Today is Friday so I don't want to follow up right before the weekend. Monday is also a federal holiday. I currently work for the government and so I have off but I'm not sure how this will affect the hours of a private corporation.

I really want to follow up somehow but my instincts are telling me to wait until Tuesday at the earliest. If I haven't heard anything by then, how should I follow up? In an email to the HR contact? Should I add the president on it? Or should I email the HR contact and text the president since that is where we have conversed already and where I am more confident I'll get a reply?

Sorry for the lengthy post. Normally I would write the whole thing off as a loss and move on, but like I mentioned before this is a job that I'm really interested in, in my dream field. I really want to do what I can to put myself in the best position possible without seeming pushy. Any advice is appreciated.

P.S., The president is the husband of the HR contact. Not sure if that complicates things."

Job A is for a large company which has some pretty negative press right now. I truly believe a lot of the press is not warranted as other companies in the industry are facing similar issues due to COVID, but this company is getting the most flack because it‚Äôs the largest target. This job pays the most, and interests me the most. 

Job B is for a company that has pretty positive press, totally different industry than A. Pays $10k less in base salary a year, and isn‚Äôt as ideal a role for me. But the company seems great to work for.

891,Is this ethical during a phone screen interview?,jobs,"So, let me start off by saying I'm an honest person and I hold that in high regards when it comes to respect. 

During a phone interview I had 2 months ago, I was told that they really liked my resume and cover letter. They said it was the best they've seen for this pool of candidates and went on to say ""you are the only one being considered out of X amount of candidates for this position!"". The conversation was light hearted and actually grea. They asked ""when can you start?"" (That's a normal question, but they save me exact dates that they're available for me to come into work for potential training.) And even went on to say ""if you want to give your 2 weeks into your job, you can use those 2 weeks to relax and get ready for the interviews that follow"" (because I told them I was working in an abusive work environment). So 2 weeks turned into 3 and I emailed asking about the situation. They said ""the hiring manager is on vacation and returning January 7 and will continue with interviews at that time."" 

It was 3 weeks from that point and I thought ""okay, thats understandable, I can wait the another 4 weeks, I've saved up enough money to relax."" 

Fast forward those 4 weeks

I email the recruiter again asking about the job. They decided not to email me immediately and have now said ""the hiring manager has found another candidate for the position' and essentially saying it was my fault as I ""...should have waited for it to be in writing."" 

I'm just flaggergasted how someone can do that to a person's livelihood and get away with it.

So, context: I‚Äôm an engineer for a large technology company (a FAANG). I hold an extremely important position on a team that is severely understaffed and overworked. During my 3 year stint here,  I‚Äôve taken on an enormous amount of responsibility and have owned several key pieces of our operation. Right now, I have zero confidence that, if needed, a single person on my team would be able to take on any work for those components. My boss has leaned on me to be a ‚Äúyes man‚Äù for my entire duration here, and I‚Äôve stupidly complied.   
  
I‚Äôm leaving the field entirely. I‚Äôve already accepted a job in a more sales focused capacity, because I‚Äôve identified that this field is completely awful for my mental health. Many 70hr weeks, many marathon incident sessions where I‚Äôve worked Friday-Sunday nonstop. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs par for the course for this type of role.   
   
My boss and I are what I‚Äôd consider friends. He‚Äôs a very type A, bold personality. However, I‚Äôm certain that I will be delivering devastating news to him, probably unexpectedly from his point of view. I know that everyone thinks they are irreplaceable - and I know that I‚Äôm not, but I do know that our role is extremely difficult to fill. Haven‚Äôt been able to hire a new person with a listing open for a year now. 

  
 I‚Äôm very concerned that my boss is going to have a knee jerk reaction to be mad and aggressive with me. I‚Äôve seen him behave this way for much smaller things, such as people simply disagreeing with him. It‚Äôs toxic, and I know it, but I‚Äôm really looking for some advice on how to soften the blow to my boss in an attempt to avoid a conflict. What I was thinking was that I would try to leverage the fact that I‚Äôm not leaving to go do the same job at another company, but frame it as I‚Äôve identified this career as bad for my mental health, and focus on this being about making a good decision for me and my family.

I applied for this managerial position and have been going through the interview process for about a month now. It started out with a HireVue preset questions interview that I ended up passing. Then I moved onto the second more traditional interview with the L&amp;D team. I received an email from one of the L&amp;D specialists who interviewed me saying they wanted to move to the next step in the process which is a realistic job preview. So basically they would be calling the closest center in my area to schedule a time for me to come in and spend a day shadowing someone in the position I'm applying for. I responded with all the necessary information on Monday when they requested it. On Monday I was currently out of town until yesterday (Thursday) afternoon so I told them the best time would be sometime next week. It's now Friday and I haven't heard anything back from them. Am I just overly eager and impatient to move this process along and this is normal practice to schedule a realistic job preview? Should I be reaching out or would that be considered bad etiquette?

897,USPS vs Target Distribution center,jobs,"I'm conflicted on what to do. Most likely it will end up how much I enjoy or hate target. But looking for advice anyhow.

I start working at target DC this weekend. Not a bad rotation. Sat,sun,mon working 12hrs for $21. Top pay around $24 in 3 years. They are also on mandatory overtime like every other job in the world these days. They say they won't work you more than 12 ever and your mandatory ot is 1 extra day a week making your 48hrs a week. Not horrible. 

However. I was told I would be picking orders with a lift and now I was shown my job at orientation yesterday and I'm already not liking it but I'll give it a few days trial. I think I'm still picking orders, however your also loading your own trucks and building walls and shit and it's just something I'm not into. I don't mind hard labor but ever since I worked seasonal for ups I'll be damn if I'm going to kill myself lifting 150+ pounds alone for any company. Unrealistic expectations. Can I physically do it? Yes. Am I going to do it repeatedly for the next 30 years? Lmao, probably not. I'm sure my knees and back will give before then.

Just finished my driving record check for cca position at usps yesterday, waiting to hear what the next step is. Only downside to cca is working constantly, which I feel I can handle. Walking alot is the main aspect but hey, as long as it's not 100 pound packages I can deal. Confirmed with friend that works there and I'm looking at 14miles a day.

Both jobs have high turnover rate. Both seem to have very good benefits. I know 20+ people that have gone to target and quit. I only know 2 that have gone to PO, one as cca the other I'm not sure but they both are still there 6 years later.

Idk, just debating on which one I should do. In reality my plan is to work target until the cca job starts and if I don't like cca I can just go back to target another time. I'm also a vet which is why I lean more towards the cca side, can buy back my 4 years towards retirement right?"

903,Thinking about asking to work with a different client at my job. Will this backfire?,jobs,"I work for a marketing agency that has dozens of clients. I was hired to almost exclusively work with their biggest client named BIG CLIENT. I have worked in this role for 8 months.

For the most part, I like my job. Decent salary, decent benefits, most (keyword, most) of my coworkers are great, I work a normal 40 hours, and it's 95% remote. 

However, many days I am stressed out. I'm responsible for maintaining the online presence of this client: online articles, social posts, email campaigns, taglines, etc. This wouldn't be that bad except I feel a lot of pressure to perform. 

Whether it's having to drive up social numbers or figure out ways to increase the open rate for emails, I sit down at my desk many days wondering if this is the day I get fired because the numbers aren't performing well enough. 

One of my coworkers, KAREN, who is senior to me but not my supervisor and handles the majority of interaction with BIG CLIENT, also has something to say everyday. Whether it's that I'm not including enough links or not following enough SEO practices, it never feels like I'm getting ahead with the work for BIG CLIENT despite actually working weeks ahead. Not to mention every few months I have to present ways to improve their numbers. It's a lot of work for a client worth millions of dollars. I'm not sure if I'm the person for it.

The last straw came when BIG CLIENT recently screwed our company over in a way that strained the relationship between both parties.

The bottom line is that I'm thinking about asking my supervisor, who is a wonderful person, to not have me work with BIG CLIENT anymore and instead work with a lot more smaller clients for the company. 

I believe that it won't be nearly as stressful since they are smaller businesses and have less expectations for performance, I wouldn't have to worry nearly as much about data trends or SEO performance, and I wouldn't have to work with KAREN nearly as often.

However, I'm worried this could backfire. I *was* initially hired to work almost exclusively with BIG CLIENT. I have helped with work for smaller clients, but 90% of my work has been for BIG CLIENT. They may just consider firing me if I express my dissatisfaction with working with BIG CLIENT. Also, I have only been working here for 8 months. They may not like that I'm asking for a responsibility change less than a year into my job. Maybe I should wait until my year mark and then ask?

Has anyone here done this before and have advice?"

I'm currently debating a big decision and would like some input.
For the past 2 years I've been at a pretty big company, and since then have had 3 managers. My new manager just started, and I really don't think we mesh well. I could see my position being eliminated from him in maybe 9 months or so that plays a role.

With that being said, I'm fully remote, and in my house with my fiance in the Northeast. We are getting married in Summer of 2023.

I have an opportunity to take over a role in Florida, where I would be out in the field. This would pair me with my old manager, who loves me, and is just great. It's a significant pay increase, (25k base 20 bonus increase, car, gas, etc).

I would have to be there minimum of 1 year to even think about an internal transfer back east. Moving away from friends/family would be tough, but that is why I would only do it for 12-15 months. I told my manager this and she understood as well.

It would be more work for sure, quite a huge change in my life, but I really ultimately would want to move back here for the wedding and to start a family, ( Im almost 30)

Is it crazy to take this position only for a year, and if I can't transfer internally after, just resign and find a new employer after a year?

Thanks for any advice."
911,"How do I avoid ""falling behind"" in the job market?",jobs,"**TLDR: I'm graduating in 2022, have been rejected from every single graduate scheme that I applied for. In my mind, this will make me even less employable since I will now not have any chance to build any experience. What should someone in this position do?**

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I am around 6 months from graduating from a fairly well regarded university with a degree in economics. While I do not wish to speak prematurely, based on achieved grades, I should graduate with a very respectable grade, not top marks, but beyond what is required by most jobs in the field of finance.

During my time at university, I did apply to various internships, yet was rejected from every one of them. With that in mind, I have undertaken a number of measures to try and differentiate myself in my employability while also making up for lacking the experience that I would have gained in those internships.

Being close to graduation, I have been applying to a wide range of financial institutions via their graduate schemes. 

However, once again, I have either not heard back from any of them, or received a rejection letter. 

This has led me to become very concerned about the medium and long term effects of not getting a job once I graduate. I am not under the illusion that I will graduate on the 27th and be in the office on the 28th, but I was certainly hoping to have some sort of offer lined up for myself by this stage.

I am not dismayed or beaten down (yet) as much as I am worried about the prospects of falling into a death cycle of: no job --&gt; no experience --&gt; no job offer --&gt; no job.

I have spoken to a few people and they have suggested getting a job that is not finance/economics related, however I fail to see how this would meaningfully boost chances of getting a job in one of these businesses since I still would have no experience in that world.

While I have no issue being in a different kind of job in the short term, I feel as if that will just end up leading to being in that job for the long term.

As I say, I know that the world is not as simple as my parents/grandparents seem to think it is where jobs/firms throw themselves at you as soon as you graduate, but I am very concerned at the idea of falling behind (arguably even more than I already am given the lack of experience already) and having ever decreasing chances of getting a job in this field.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I tried to not make it a sob-post since that is honestly not my intention at all."

I now have 15 vacation days a year, 9 sick days, health, dental, vision, 401k, all the good stuff, and almost enough income to be very comfortable instead of just exist on the edge of ruin.

  
This new job is in corporate.  I now work in Marketing.  As a kid, I swore to myself I'd never be a cubical office drone going to work every day in a suite.  Well, I kept that promise at least, as I work remote, usually in pajamas!  But that's not what I am here to rant about.

  
What I am here to say is that this is the MOST laid back job I've ever had.  It blows my mind that I have stretches of hours at a time where I can just think, learn new skills, network, and de-stress during the work day.  Everywhere else I've been, customer service, retail, food industry, the pace was unending and the rare downtime was consumed by ""if you can lean, you can clean"".

  
What I fail to understand is why are people working 3x as hard as some of the people in my department being paid almost half as much as us?  They work 3x harder, but we make double the national minimum and more when we work from our couch at our own pace?  I get that I have a masters degree, so people can claim  I am worth more, but I disagree.  I feel that the entry level jobs at my company can be done by anyone.  

  
I just don't get why the job market is so backwards and unfair, with people who make the most having all the luxuries people speak of as only a dream job, while the hardest workers are paid scraps and have 2-5 jobs just to afford to live close to the salarymen their companies give coffee and cosmetics to.

I‚Äôm still 1.5-2 hours away from the head office though. Obviously I need to wait and see how this next interview goes, but is this something I can try to negotiate if/when I get an offer? 

I don‚Äôt mind going into the office maybe 2-3 times every fortnight, but I don‚Äôt want to lose so much of my day travelling to work. And I feel misled that it was advertised as a remote role. On the other hand, this job hunt has been a bitch and taken such a toll on my mental health. Do I just take this even for now and reapply to roles more local to me in a few months?"

She would look at the folding I've done, look at it and say ""you didn't do a good job"" and she is just weird and bossy to me.

So I've been job hunting for a while now. Currently, I've been working in Sainsbury's and it's been enough to support myself but over Covid, my girlfriend moved in and we've decided we want to move to Glasgow. So we have enough savings and earnings to get a mortgage on a fairly decent flat but my issue is finding work.

Yesterday I heard back from FDM Group mentioning they had found my CV and were wondering if I was interested in a Software Developer role. It would be 12-14 weeks of remote training covered by the company as well as ¬£18,000 as a salary. This adds up to more money and more time to find a place to buy and actually comfortably move in before starting the 2-year contract with a finance company in Glasgow at the end of the training. 

After completing a prerecorded video interview this morning I'll hear back tonight about moving onto the next stage. The current issue however is a 4 week notice period vs a starting date of the 31st of January. I've been told by other employees and past members that they only worked 2 of their 4 weeks but I'm not sure how this works out. Essentially I'd have to hand in my notice before knowing I have the job.

I've been looking for a job for the last 8 months and I am currently employeed but the mobbing I am getting from my boss is intolerable. So a company in our own sector, a corporate one with a lot of offices / factories abroad found me and asked me if I'd be interesting in a job offer. They have been stalking me on LinkedIn since last month, and some of the members actually added me and when the consultancy company that I know they work with sent me a message so it was kinda obvious that they were going to offer me something, I was prepared. I nailed the pre-interview phone call, then the HR asked me for an interview on Zoom with the department manager and I nailed that too, they said we will call you in 2 weeks but after that day they immediately asked me for a final interview which is with the general manager. Which was today; an hour ago, I expected only 2 person but there were 8 people, the overall energy was highly negative to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

When someone asked me a question I was focussing on the eye contact but they weren't, they were constantly looking at each other and giving me the feeling that they got ""bored"", that made feel a bit stressed. The company was huge, and it was my very first interview with a company like that professional. Maybe they did it on purpose I don't know but I felt pretty bad and messed it up with my answers, I started to get struggled and in the end, they were like ""uhm, okay then we have no other questions, you may go and we will get back to you within 2 weeks either the result is positive or negative"", I can't stop blaming myself and feeling upset.

&amp;#x200B;

None of the companies I've applied to got back to me for 8 months and this company found me in the beginning of the new year so I thought ""finally this could be my year"", but seems I won't be getting a call. At least, that's why I feel."

I can‚Äôt screw up this application because there aren‚Äôt any other jobs like it where I live. I tried going for administrative assistant but most need experience with payroll/HR or accounting in which I have no experience in. I‚Äôm a fast learner but of course that won‚Äôt help anywhere.

I appreciate any advice on this before I give up and just take whatever job."

But I had no choice ready so I accepted the job and have been going through all the paperwork to get officially hired.

At the same time I kept applying for other jobs. I thought you never know, maybe in the next month I'll come across something which is better for me.

Is this wrong? Should I just chill down and focus on the job I already have?"

956,Can I be rehired years later after being fired?,jobs,"Hello everyone, so here's my story. I got hired at a restaurant back in August 2016, and I got fired March 2017, the reason for that was because I did a no call no show, and the reason why I did a no call no show was because a guy that I used to work with would always harass me, I'm not sure if harass would be the right word but I worked with a guy who would literally just get mad at me for one tiny thing I would do wrong all the time, at the time I was new to the position so I had a lot to learn but any mistake I made he would just get so mad, and make me feel so uncomfortable and give me such a hard time, and I didn't want to go through that again because I was in a similar situation before, and you can't learn like that when someone gives you a hard time for your mistakes.. At the time I had spoke to a manager and he said he was going to put me back into my old position so I wouldn't have to work with him and deal with his BS. He did absolutely nothing, at the time this so called "" MANAGER "" was also new, he did nothing so one day I just got so fed up with the BS that I decided not to show up. Then I get a call from another manager who really liked me and told me to come in to pick up my last check, he was sad to see me go because he really liked how I worked. I know me doing a no call no show wasn't the right thing to do in a situation like that, I should've handled it differently. Fast forward to early 2021, my old coworker friend had spoke to a manager about me and he said that I should try to apply again since it's been a good amount of time since I got fired and I did, I applied and went for an interview and the manager who interviewed me, I told her my story and she really wanted to give me a second chance, however a few days later I got an email saying they hired someone else? She said she was going to speak to her "" PARTNERS "" which I assumed it was HR but I never got hired. I'm thinking of applying there again, will I get the same outcome? Or should I speak to someone at HR?"

960,Choosing between big name company and promising startup,jobs,"How much does a big company name matter?

I'm considering two offers, both for the same title.

Company A is a big international company with lots of opportunities to grow. Just 1 year at this company will likely open up a lot of doors. But starting out the role will be pretty limited, and the pay is decent but not that high. It's also in the travel sector, and they laid off 30% of their workers during the start of the pandemic. They're scaling back up and hiring again, but there's still a lot of risk involved. I would need to move to a different country as well.

Company B is a SAAS startup that grew a lot during the pandemic, but is still pretty small and unknown. It's in the computer vision space though, partly in VR, so I imagine it's going to grow quite a bit if the Metaverse pulls through. But it's a startup so there's always a risk of it failing or just not growing. The pay is much better compared to A, and the role will be more challenging. I can also work anywhere I want in the world in this role.

Would love to hear any opinions you guys have. Thanks in advance!"

I have a dream company and role. Yesterday, I reached out to a recruiter on LinkedIn expressing interest in the role. I wasn't sure their application cycle, so I just asked her when too look for roles as I hadn't seen anything listed on the website in a while.

Well magically, the role was just posted a few hours ago. Coincidence? I don't know?

Anyways, I have a resume gap and I am unemployed. I am interviewing for a 3 month contract at a prestigious company to do some simple science stuff. I spoke to a recruiter for it, and she said expect an interview like Monday and to start the job next week (they are trying to hire 25 people ASAP). I was wondering, should I wait to potentially get that job to show I am working currently and boost my resume? Or should I apply to this job position ASAP despite my gap (it was literally posted a few hours ago on the company's website)?"

970,"All these fast food and retail jobs ‚Äúdesperately hiring‚Äù, where are all the workers going? If they‚Äôre all creating businesses/working from home, how are they doing it?",jobs,"There are PLENTY of scam artists online, but there are probably even more real life business claiming they‚Äôre understaffed because ‚Äúno one wants to work‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all choosing to sit at home collecting unemployment and stimulus checks‚Äù.

That‚Äôs just Idiocracy, because a few stimulus checks last year, equaling $3,200 for individuals (not THAT MUCH MORE for having child dependents) isn‚Äôt enough to retire at any age, and the $600+ a week unemployment (on top of state unemployment) was discontinued. So those excuses are BS.

I also can‚Äôt believe that all of these workers are simply getting into real careers, or even just going to school fulltime, because people‚Äôs skill sets or disposable income aren‚Äôt blowing up overnight just because they come to the realization that life is too short to be a wage slave.

Everyone is sick of wasting 40+ hours of their life doing meaningless labor that serves no ultimate purpose other than making the rich richer. They‚Äôre tired of having inflexible, constantly inconsistently changing schedules, being denied overtime, and we‚Äôre all sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask all goddamn day (yes, even if you‚Äôre vaccinated you can be required to wear a mask).

And they‚Äôre also telling us we must take the shots, or have a swab shoved up our nose EVERY WEEK, or be terminated. We are so sick and tired of being slaves to corporate overlords, often for not even a basic living wage (especially in all the cases of fast food and retail so DESPERATELY HIRING).

We‚Äôre sick of not even being allowed to go to the fucking bathroom when we have to.

You know who else are forced to do things they don‚Äôt want to do, and that go against their own best interests? The Chinese, North Koreans, even Australians.

But not only does rent, bills, and all living necessities still cost money, inflation continues to rise prices.

These people quitting these jobs HAVE to be making money some other way. But how?

Everyone claiming how to ‚Äúmake 5-6 figures in the next few months‚Äù is a scam artist, sometimes even promoting ILLEGAL activity.

And don‚Äôt tell me something like ONLYFANS, because a lot of employees ‚Äúgoing their own way‚Äù are men, and I also just don‚Äôt believe all of the women are becoming, adult entertainers.

What is going on? Because they‚Äôre sure as hell not living off of the government for THIS LONG. 

I want to own my own life too, preferably without having to continue wageslaving and going to school for 4+ years first. I also just want to be left alone in my own home, I‚Äôm not the most social person‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Without publicly funded healthcare millions of us Americans also rely on employers to subsidize our health insurance to pay for our prescriptions and any emergency operations (and still usually get left in debt when it‚Äôs an emergency procedure) so do you just have to make enough to pay everything out of pocket? Or pay the full premium? Or is there some kind of specialty subsidized health insurance for self-employed once they achieve a certain income threshold?

I‚Äôm also not, great with driving, so that‚Äôs another reason to cut out daily commuting (Uber is expensive 2+x daily) but honestly I‚Äôd want to work from my own home, ALONE, faceless behind a computer screen, regardless.

I don‚Äôt really belong in society anyway."

978,"Recommended to post here: If I leave, the company will likely die. Advice in a predicament?",jobs,"I work for a small company in a very demanding industry. Everyone knows everyone, reputations are everything, all that stuff. When I say small, I mean there's me, my boss (the owner), and an accountant.

The way we've structured this, we essentially outsource all of aspects of our company. Because of this, we have key placed industry partners who handle the performance of the majority of our work. We sale, engineer, facilitate, and manage all of our projects, they handle the ground work. Mercenaries, if you will.

In doing so, there are a TON of moving parts between the companies we work with on both sides of the project.

Now that this has been laid out, the details:

Me are a multi-million dollar business and have grown successfully over the last 5 years, with exponential growth over the last 2 years. Because no new help has been brought on to work through the insanity that we see every day, I am essentially running the company myself. Again, there is only myself, my boss, and accountant.

My boss, who is supposed to and initially had a huge role in the company - a counterpart working toward the same goal, has slowly transitioned to delegate all of his tasks to me...on top of the tasks I already had.

While I'm gracious that he trusts me to get the job done, I am not happy with this. In the delegation, he essentially has moved to doing nothing. This is partially to do with the fact that he's starting a business in a different industry on the side, well outside the industry we are in now.

I've taken over all sales, sales management, project management, vendor management, contracts management, procurement and sourcing, logistics, customer service, service and maintenance management, service coordinator, inventory, day to day operations, and so on. I also travel 12 hours round trip to the field once a month at a minimum. I don't do the books though!

I'm exhausted. Absolutely exhausted. I've asked for help, supposedly my boss has interviewed some guys in hopes of finding 2-3, and we're nowhere. This has been months.

He's turned into an empty shell, never available to handle anything. Whenever I need to go to him, as it's his business, I can rarely get ahold of him. The majority of our industry partners don't bother with reaching out to him anymore because they know he won't answer...or call back. Therefore, it's all on me.

He took more than 3 months off last year alone...on vacations and to work on that other business. I found out 1/3 that he'd be gone for two weeks starting the coming weekend.

Last year was our most profitable year and he wants us to double. I can't do it. My work is suffering because I can't keep up, I'm losing track of things, there's an overwhelming of work on my plate. On top of that, I just closed a huge contract I've been chasing for a year which adds even more. We are over-committed.

Because of all this, to keep my sanity and hair, I'm considering looking elsewhere. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity and have learned an incredible amount over these few years, but I'm in a position where this can't continue. If I leave, because of how things are run, the company will likely die.

Maybe that's too much on my conscience, I don't know. Still, despite being paid $1XX,XXX last year for my efforts, I feel undervalued knowing what the company profited last year. This is all going to go away (domino/snowball effect) if I walk. Hell, a large chunk of my gross was reimbursements for work travel. This includes salary + commission + profit sharing + reimbursements, and I'm a contractor with no benefits because he feels the company is too small to make the accountant and I official employees.

I apologize if this doesn't read well, it's likely word vomit. Any input is greatly appreciated!"

983,Got a raise and a few backhanded compliments along the way,jobs,"A little backstory: I was ops manager for a subsidiary of a larger corporate entity, and was transferred to the corporate entity out of desperation on their part. Multiple people quit in the corporate office, everything was falling to pieces, and I expressed interest in moving into the position to my manager for three reasons: 1) my manager is incompetent and I could not work with them anymore, 2) the vacant position at corporate aligned with my career goals, 3) I had a feeling I was about to be laid off - I was fielding a lot of questions about the percent of time I spend of specific tasks. However, I had no experience or formal education in this new role. Met with the corporate officers in charge, they expressed hesitation but ultimately transferred me because they were so desperate.  I took on the role of several people, and I got a small salary bump. This happened end of October. 

Fast forward to now, I was informed yesterday that I got a pretty big raise that would be reflected on my next paycheck. I was told that my work was very appreciated, I was able to get everyone caught up, and I've proved to understand data and how to apply it to various situations. But in that conversation, I received backhanded compliments along the way. ""We didn't think you could handle the pressure,"" ""You were almost laid off but thank god we didn't go that route,"" ""you have no experience in this area and we thought we'd have to clean up your messes,"" and my favorite, ""We really didn't think you were competent."" 

Y'all. It felt really good to get that big salary bump, but my feelings were super hurt. And, the salary bump is still not enough to live a super comfortable life in a high COL area. I appreciate the positive things that they said about me, but I'm still actively looking for a new job. 

No advice needed. Just expressing my feelings."

Learned a lot very quickly, glowing 90-day review and tons of great commentary and feedback on my work. I enjoy it for the most part, find the hours a bit much.. but it‚Äôs fine.

I‚Äôm considered by some employers a ‚Äúrecent grad‚Äù because I decided to go back to school in my 30s, but have 15+ years of relevant working experience across two industries that are directly and indirectly related to what I do now. I let my lack of confidence keep me from demanding more during my negotiations (and i did negotiate)

It‚Äôs a huge company and I‚Äôm learning that the road to promotion is a bit more arduous than I thought and I‚Äôm not actually even eligible for well over another year. I‚Äôm not satisfied with my pay but justified it with the gained experience and remote work. 

BUT I‚Äôm getting recruited heavily. Not just by randoms either. Directly contacted by people I‚Äôm connected to and by some legitimate industry recruiters. I finally had a conversation with one just to see.. and I know they‚Äôre looking to meet numbers, but when we discussed what it would take for me to leave (a title change and about 30k over my current salary, remote, etc) he didn‚Äôt even blink a eye. 

Obviously these aren‚Äôt offers.. But knowing the market and some of the orgs he‚Äôs recommending, I know my being hired into that pay range isn‚Äôt far fetched. 

BUT I don‚Äôt want to give myself a bad reputation by leaving somewhere bedore even a year.. but also really how long will it take for me to even hit that salary milestone in my current position?

He has unrealistic expectations since he wanted it to be like last year but no one from his team was there last year.

5. Inventories are not well managed. We have stock with customers but we don't know if it's the customer's or ours. For the annual inventory, after a week that I asked for it, I still do not know if we do an inventory at our customers. No news.

I then worked 8 months in an entry level sales role for a technology firm before I moved into their HR dept as I didn‚Äôt have a passion for the products I was selling and I disliked all the talking/schmoozing = no motivation to work. 

After a year or so working in HR on redundancies, I left the country and moved to London where I worked in another entry level role doing production forecasting for a gourmet doughnut start-up. Honestly, I wanted to eat free doughnuts cause they were so good and I liked baking. What I didn‚Äôt realise was an office job in a bakery would hardly equate to feeling the same joy from baking and eating. The role bored me out of my mind as it was very routine with a lot of fact checking.

After 6 months, I found another role as an R&amp;D Tax Consultant and technical writer which was immensely interesting as I enjoyed writing the narratives for different companies who described their innovations in interviews. However, it was just me and 2 other people whom I liked but didn‚Äôt feel like I could be entirely comfortable with as my superiors. I did this for about a year. 

I returned to my country after my visa expired and am now in another HR role back at my old tech company doing systems analysis, governance and compliance tasks. I originally enjoyed it but it wasn‚Äôt something I saw myself doing long term. 

One of the better parts of previous jobs was figuring out excel for my team mates. Along with disliking corporate culture (I.e. I believe in if results are obtained, how you dress, when you work, if your camera is on or not in meetings, etc shouldn‚Äôt matter) and needing a lot of freedom, I‚Äôm now at another point where I have no idea how to find the right career for me. 

Any advice or if you wanna throw out a career path for me to explore, that would be much appreciated!!"
990,How to deal with salary questions.,jobs,"I just finished 3 rounds of interviews for a great job. In the final round, I gave a 1hr seminar and spoke to 10 people one on one for 30 min each. The hiring manager and senior VP loved meeting me and used language like ‚Äúwhen you get here, you will‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúhere‚Äôs another plug for you.‚Äù During this third round, I also spoke with the HR manager and she asked about salary expectation, I gave a range that was about 13% higher than what she was thinking. I told her I was flexible so don‚Äôt tAke it too seriously. Do you think I just ruined my chances of getting an offer?"

992,Replanting my roots,jobs,"Worked in the cannabis industry for years in a small city, had a nice life, relatively easy job, good coworkers, living in a small but affordable 1bdrm apartment etc. Then I met a girl, fell in love, quit my job, completely uprooted my life and moved to Ottawa where I know absolutely nobody except her family.

Took a shitty job for the time being, expecting to be find a better one soon after..... Fast forward half a year later and still no closer to a job and being laid off.

I recently applied for a position with a startup company that is only 4 years old but is a very exciting innovation in my field and I just got an email that they want ME to come in next week and do a facility/office tour! After 3 rounds of interviews with various Chiefs, Managers and Directors I'm finally getting back into a comfortable position in my field and I can't be more excited for a job that I can see myself being in for years.

They haven't explicitly said that I have the job but I'm super optimistic.

I'm mostly just proud of myself, I feel validated in my education and career choices, growing up on a small town farm to making it in a big city... I can't wait to call my parents and say ""Hey, I did it""

TL;DR : left my job, family and friends to follow a girl, took a crappy ""for now"" job, couldn't find or get a better job for 6 months until now, going in next week to tour the facility/office and feeling proud of myself because I made this happen for me."

You get the point.  However, as an accountant, I actually see who uses it and who doesn't.  Let's say very few people, if any at all, take advantage of this  benefit. For this example let's say

1. No one uses it, 0%
2. Very few use it, 10%, 1/10

It  would seem like it's frowned upon to use. Sure legally &amp; officially  no one is saying ""no"" and managers say ""yes it's available"", but no one  really does. Would you feel comfortable taking advantage of these  benefits in situation 1 or 2 above?"

Currently he is making the same as I am but I am in LA and they are in Salt Lake City.

The pandemic isn't helping matters either. So I thought, why not. It'll help with my resume.

Unfortunately I didn't get a call back, but that was definitely different. Just curious if anyone else here has had an experience like this.

1008,Having a ‚Äúwork mom‚Äù is better than a work wife/husband.,jobs,"So I recently learned about this concept having a name, and I instantly took to it as I feel like I had a work mom for a while.

A few jobs ago, my former boss (my ‚Äúwork mom‚Äù) hired me and gave me a chance as she said she saw my potential. 

She was great about setting up potlucks and happy hours, really establishing an awesome work culture in our department. Always asking about the family and my partner at the time, all that jazz. Bringing food and snacks and cookies. She always offered support if I needed something, and would always go to bat for me if I needed managerial backing.

She eventually got a new job, and offered me a role a few months later. Needless to say I agreed, and always tried to go above and beyond to be a good employee and colleague to her.

We no longer work together, but still keep in touch regularly to chat about work and life. Not even just grabbing a coffee or lunch, even going to each other‚Äôs holiday parties and such. She and her husband never had kids, so I wonder if part of her energy was to fill that gap. (Not saying this in a bad way.)

I feel lucky to have found this kind of connection. I don‚Äôt think I would be where I‚Äôm at professionally without having known her. 

Lesson? If you‚Äôre lucky enough to find someone who has work mom energy, establish a connection with them."

 1). All these new positions I see posted on indeed every day are legit. Covid is causing worker shortages, plenty of jobs, my biggest problem (God willing) will be choosing between different offers.

2). All these job postings are EIDL/SBA/PPP scams. Employers showing that they are "" pursuing candidates"", when in reality they are getting paid government money to not hire anyone as long as they keep a posting open.

1020,Having difficulty picking between two offers,jobs,"I am in the final stages of interviewing at two separate jobs. Both jobs are in the healthcare field but they‚Äôre in different areas. 

Job A is a receptionist job at a local specialty office. The pay range is $12-16/hour, it‚Äôs an 8 minute walk from home, family owned, and 32 hours a week. The major downsides are monthly pay and I would be taking my own taxes out of my paycheck. The location and the owners are big pluses for me. I don‚Äôt drive and I instantly felt a connection with one of the owners.  It would also help me get experience for my healthcare administration ministration degree.

Job B is at a Walmart pharmacy. I would be guaranteed $16.50 an hour or more, it‚Äôs a ten minute drive that my boyfriend would help with, and part-time hours. I‚Äôm not thrilled about working for a big company and I‚Äôve previously worked at a chain pharmacy and absolutely hated it. The pay and the hours are most attractive to me.

I really want to go for job A, but the monthly pay and being responsible for my taxes really worries me. Job B pays more for less hours, but it‚Äôs Walmart. I need extra cash and to be able to still take care of my daughter and finish school."

My boss who owns the company is not much older than I am. He's only 30 and I'm 25.  He runs the entire company, and he's doing alright i'd say, but there are problems. 

Let me start by saying there are no benefits and no OT. My boss made a deal with me about personal healthcare, but he has told me straight up that he cannot afford OT for anyone in the company, so whatever. Well i've worked OT and it comes out as regular pay over the 40 on my stubs, so he wasn't lying about that, which is fine. I have personally chosen not to work over 40 in a week, but some guys do it and get paid the straight pay anyways. 

Well work with my company has been really slamming all of us because of the amount of jobs and the insanely short deadlines that need to be met to finish the jobs on time. Well, a lot of the days require us to keep working past our normal 8 hour shifts... We can work anywhere from 8-12 hour days, which is whatever. But those hours add up beyond 40 sometimes and it's either not doc'd or when it is its just regular pay over the 40. Like I said, I've stopped doing anything over a normal 40 hour week. 

Well, this is causing some conflict at work because I'll get asked to stay behind or even work on weekends, but I normally say no because the time isnt paid as OT once we hit 40. I'm really not sure if I'm wrong for leaving when I need to, but it does make my boss and some of my coworkers upset. They all say they don't care, but I know they do because the work I do always gets reported to my boss and the things that get said about me travel around right back to me. So I know my boss isn't happy with my performance when it comes to working longer days or even weekends. But it's just not OT so I'm not making as much as I probably should for doing over 40."

1033,I'm a COVID Graduate. Here's What I Learned About This Job Market,jobs,"As someone who is just entering the full-time job market, I gotta say, hiring managers are playing checkers so you gotta play chess. Some things I've seen so far and learned:

1. Just because the recruiter or HM is excited during your interview, that doesn't mean you're going to get the job. Whether they're hinting at you being the only qualified person for the job or not, go into it thinking ""I still don't have a job, so I owe no one anything."" I recently interviewed for 2 months for a spot (made it to the final round). Everyone was so nice, and really enjoyed speaking with me, and added me on LinkedIn. However, I did not get it at all. Throughout the entire search I kept hesitating on applying to other places, because I really convinced myself I was going to get that job. They even had me do free work (first time for that one). So yeah, lesson learned. I'm young, spare me. 
2. HM will not take more than 1 day to get back to you, if they're serious. Everyone thinks they're Google or Meta, and as an applicant, you need to remind them that they are not. After the final interview, I feel the turnaround time for the person actually getting it is, 1 day. If you're 2nd or 3rd in line you're more likely playing the waiting game. Now, there are some exceptions, if they still have interviews after you. Instead of asking ""When should I hear back."" tell them... ""I need to know a decision by (date) or I will be moving on."" That way, if they have a counter statement, they will say it, like whenever their last interview date is AND you can get a feel if they really want you or not and if you should move on. Never email them with this statement, always say it in the interview, that way they have to think on the spot and you can see their expression. Personally, I feel there's no harm in this statement because why would you want to work for a company that doesn't value your time? Only email them saying you've moved on, after you get an offer from them that you will not be accepting or will be... other than that, they don't care. 
3. Applying in the COVID market for entry-level is HORRIBLE. You'll often see a lot of part-time gigs and honestly just have to work 2 jobs. It's ridiculous. I got so tired of applying &amp; creating new accounts, here's what I did. 
   1. Linkedin, search companies (click the search bar and just press enter, don't put in anything) and filter for your industry. You can also filter for location and company size, just to make sure you're not looking at companies that are basically probably one-man band start-ups. 
   2. You see the list? Great, now right click on each company that looks appealing and open it in a new tab. Do this for each company (obviously, there's a drawback, because the company has to catch your eye with just the logo and the location or whatever) Then every tab you opened, press the ""website"" in the header. The website will usually open in a new tab, and now you can close the old one. Remember to keep the original tab open so you don't lose your place in your search. 
   3. For each company go to their career site, and find SOMEONE ANYONE  to email. A lot of companies have career emails, or just general email addresses. Some even have an email pop-up where you just have to enter what you want to say and send from the website. Just be sure to copy and paste the general ""I'm looking for a position, here's my resume."" Obviously put your spin on it. 
   4. Get all those emails and BCc them into all one email. This way you kill many birds with one stone and also you have a one stop shop in the future to find emails for companies you want to work at. If any person finds it wrong to do this, I feel like maybe they haven't applied to 400+ jobs. 
   5. The downside: entry-level probably won't get much interest. The upside: You spend less time applying for jobs where they definitely won't even look at your resume, and more time interacting with people who actually want you. Also, they get to see the initiative you took and it helps for some but not all companies. 
4. KEEP LOOKING! Don't stop, like ever. Depending on your situation. I had ideas to offer my services for freelance to some companies I know the owners of, but the idea of corporate life just sounded so safe at the time. Now I'm just like ""Fuck this, gotta get money."" things take time. So even if you offer your services today, they probably won't get back to you with a decision for days on end, and the money won't come until probably a week or more. The upside: you make your own hours, so you can still look for a job. 
5. Being overtly nice will not get you any bonus points. If you're not right for the job, then you're just not right for the job. I've had people say, ""I like you and your personality, you're just not a great fit."" I respect it, and honestly that's mainly my fault. Sending thank you emails after an interview and literally letting every little thing slide, ahhh nope. If the interviewer does something you're not comfortable with, shut that shit down! You aren't begging for a job, and chances are they probably weren't going to hire you anyway. So you gotta play Russian Roulette with this. 

To all my job seekers out there... you got this. Another note, make sure your LinkedIn looks pretty af. I'm talking whatever industry you're in, make it appealing to those people. Also add everyone on linkedin in your industry. Stop trying to fill up your linkedin with people from your school. Fuck them. You need people who work at the companies you want to work at! So add hiring managers, recruiters, C-suite, shit even the entry level folks. After some time of doing this, you won't have to search as hard for those people because their posts will pop up on your feed as suggestions. This took me about 100-150 connections to start getting suggestions.

1045,Do any companies scale pay for remote work in regards to moving from a MCOL to a HCOL area?,jobs,"Yes, you read the title correct, this is quite the opposite.

However, I feel like my mental health is seriously deteriorating because of the place I live in. It's a dead town where everything is lights off after 9pm, dating life is non-existent, no attractions, far from everything, people here are horrible, too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. I hate that my personality is like this, but I feel like I'm wasting my mid 20's here.

At the moment I‚Äôm scheduled for a 4th interview with company A, and although I‚Äôm feeling confident about getting an offer, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll love the position and I‚Äôm not crazy about the commute either. I‚Äôm only considering it because the pay is decent and I‚Äôm so tired of applying and interviewing. But I‚Äôve also just applied to another position at company B which seems to be a better fit, and offers a hybrid schedule, and is actually within walking distance from my house! We‚Äôre in the process of scheduling an interview but they seem enthusiastic about meeting me.

My worry is that I‚Äôll receive an offer from job A while still in the middle of interviewing for company B. And I‚Äôm also waiting to hear back from 3 other companies I‚Äôve interviewed with that I preferred over job A. 

Would it be shitty of me to accept a job offer, but then continue to interview and entertain other offers before my start date? If I ask for some time to review the offer, realistically how long could I stall while holding out for a better offer? Has anyone else been in this situation?"

Lately I feel like my boss doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm progressing as I should. For example I didn‚Äôt CC somebody who I should‚Äôve for an email and there was some confusion so when I called my boss in he got frustrated that I hadn‚Äôt emailed the right person. He kind of went into a little speech about how I need to start learning the intricacies of the job and he‚Äôs a nice guy so he wasn‚Äôt yelling but I could tell he was hinting that I wasn‚Äôt where he thinks I should be.

Today was even worse because a mistake was caught that‚Äôs actually kind of a big deal that I made about two months ago. My senior (not the boss I‚Äôm talking about) called me to let me know that they‚Äôre ‚Äúconcerned about a few things‚Äù and kind of went into another speech about how they can‚Äôt be looking over my shoulder for every little thing.

I really don‚Äôt think that I mess up that often and I feel like it should be somewhat expected that I make a few mistakes here and there but I‚Äôm an incredibly anxious person and my boss kind of piles it on if you make (or he notices) two mistakes in a short period of time.

1058,SUPER ULTRA HOTTER THAN THE SUN HOT TAKE,jobs,"Women are trash managers and I don't give a fuck the amount of ""Karma"" I will lose and downvotes I will get for this but I need a place to vent. I've worked probably over 50 jobs for different reasons (I have a stable career now in my early 30s) but I've never had a SINGLE good female manager my entire career. Women work hard but they work off pure emotion, micro-managing and extremely insane timelines that usually aren't meetable. My first corporate job, I had a female manager that was a micro-managing cunt from hell and I can't say it got any better from there. She was so bad she received death threats (not by me, other former interns). It was supposed to be a 6 month internship. I lasted 3 because she made my life a living fucking hell. Female managers love to micro-managers. If they weren't up your fucking ass 24/7 they wouldn't have a job. The only reason they are managers is typically because they are good at staying at places long enough to get the promotion. I fucking HATE female managers and honestly, at this point in my career, I won't work for one of these stupid emotional cunts. I will hit an interview, if the manager is female, I'm out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, every SINGLE male manager I have had has been cool in their own way. They aren't always perfect but they are way more chill than females. This is why all CEOs are men for the most part unless its some not serious job that the woman made herself CEO and no doubt the business will fail unless daddy bails her out. I'm liberal about 90% of things and female co-workers can be chill but female managers and PMS run straight off emotion and love to make their subordinates lives living hells. fuck female managers. I wont work for one ever again. I'm telling you, if you are a man you'll see what I'm talking about. These females are trash managers and should never go above supervisor. Female managers are garbage and fuck them."

1062,Fed up with the job-search. I sought catharsis by writing a snarky blog-post informed by the frustrations. Hopefully this'll help you laugh at the absurdity of looking for a job these days. [Reposted with more descriptive title].,jobs,"With the new year starting, hiring is picking back up, meaning it's time to start posting openings online. It's difficult to write a proper job description, but these tips will ensure that the only applications you get will be from people who are a shell of a human being that is so desperate for income that your company won't have to worry about them speaking up in any way.

**Introduction**: This oft-overlooked section can go a long way to indicate that a candidate will be expected to feign enthusiasm by asking ""Are you ready to change the \[what your company does\] industry?"" It's important that you set an enthusiastic tone here, not only to weed out cynics that think work shouldn't be the only thing they care about, but also because your own leadership might read this, and you sure don't want some VP complaining that you're not representing executives' delusions of a healthy, positive work environment.

**Company Description**: It is crucial that this section include as many buzzwords as possible without actually indicating what the company does. Since no one has heard of the rinky-dink outfit that you're recruiting for, you must make sure that you don't actually give candidates information that might make them not want to apply. Remember: if you don't tell your prospective candidates what you do, they won't have a reason to reject you.

**Responsibilities**: Just like the company description, this should be as vague as possible. Your best bet is to just google the title, and paste from the first result you get. Sure, anyone applying for that position should of course already know the basics of what that title does, and is seeking more context of what exactly they'll be working on day-to-day. But if you explicitly describe what the job is, the candidate may hold you to that once they're hired, and we all know accountability is a one-way street.

**Qualifications**: Ideally this should contain something completely impossible, e.g. 10 years experience in a 5-year old technology. This is to weed out people who might be tempted to point out when leadership is acting delusional.

**Keywords**: Feel free to pepper the JD with these phrases to dissuade any would-be candidates that have learned to decode your organization's Orwellian doublespeak from applying:

* ‚ÄúFast paced‚Äù: understaffed.
* ‚ÄúEntrepreneurial environment / startup culture‚Äù: leadership can‚Äôt make decisions, so figure it out for yourself.
* ‚ÄúUnlimited PTO‚Äù: you‚Äôll be pressured to not ever take time off.
* ‚ÄúWork hard, play hard‚Äù: you‚Äôre going to work 60 hours a week, so you better squeeze what you can out of your time off. Also, the CEO is a triathlete.
* ‚Äúlike a family‚Äù: toxic.
* ‚ÄúCompetitive salary‚Äù: do your research ‚Äòcause we‚Äôre gonna lowball you.
* ‚ÄúHighly visible role‚Äù: your manager won‚Äôt back you up.
* ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for a rockstar‚Äù: we want you to pretend you love working our unreasonable hours.

But of course, the JD is only the first part of landing the cattle-car of candidates you'll need to recommend to the hiring manager. Just as important is the application itself. Remember that this must be made as painful as possible. After all, if a candidate isn't willing to devote a measly ninety minutes to your application, how can you trust that they'll quietly accept their role as just another soulless corporate drone?

**Start Date**: This field should not be free-text, but require a specific date. Of course, your candidate has absolutely no idea how long your hiring process will take, so you don't want to give them the flexibility to communicate nuance. Committing to, and being held accountable for unreasonable expectations stemming from your organization's poor communication are going to be crucial for this role, so you may as well begin filtering for that now.

**Salary Requirements**: Similar to start date, this should not be free-text but force a single number. Stripping away any notion of salary being only one portion of overall compensation and subject to a range will help you to find the easiest chumps to lowball. It has the added bonus of weeding out anyone with enough insight to point out the irony that the job posting is pushing enthusiasm for the role/company so that you can say you don't want people who are only interested in a paycheck, while at the same time allowing you to filter people based on their price.

**Resume upload and related field entry**: This is hands-down the most important part of your application process. I cannot over-stress the importance of requiring candidates to submit a resume as well as enter the very same information in text fields that they have to click through individually, ideally on separate pages. This is the only way to ensure you're getting candidates that will willingly do menial, repetitive re-work without complaint. I know it seems crazy to ask them to re-enter the information already provided in their resume, which they worked hard to getting just so. But this how you guarantee all your candidates are willing to do pointless tasks to satisfy the whims of an uncaring corporate monolith.

Finding candidates is hard, but by following these few tips, you'll always have a rich pipeline of spineless milquetoasts who have had every last ounce of spirit crushed out of them to recommend to your management, keeping them happy and keeping you from having to subject yourself to this soul-rending inhuman hell that is looking for a job."
1063,"Advice on my current job situation, its making me anxious",jobs,"Hello, I am a junior interior designer working in a very demanding field. My current company deals with 90% of residential work for clients  where we plan their homes etc that I happily apart of. But not to deny I am struggling that sometimes I feel left out.

Its always been my passion doing what I do but at times it can ruthless and a highly competitive environment. So first I will give a short background about myself before I get to the nitty gritty details. 

So I am a junior who worked in the scope 3d visualizing for 2 years (freelance and previous company experience) but with this new job that I am almost 2 months in it‚Äôs completely a big step I had to take for my own growth, since we do mostly 2d space planning and drawings for clients which a bit back to basics and its also the experience I personally need.

Its different because I realized when I did 3d I didn‚Äôt focus very much kn the spaces rather than it should look ‚Äúgood‚Äù aspect. Now I am getting the chance to think more about the space in 2d which I am grateful for.

 I quit a very dreadful job in November 2021 and got offered a traineeship at this new company where I do A lot of things I like and see growth in BUT I‚Äôve realized that I am not as skilled at a software I an using to do my drawings in  which makes take more of my time, but regardless doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt meet my deadlines and try to put it i. Max effort in  everything as well as get opinions and discuss it with my colleagues. 

My only issue is my manager which is probably the worst manager Ive ever had to deal with.

1- She has a very stuck up and rude attitude most of the time that makes it harder for me to work and adapt to her even-though I am trying to get closer to her 

2- we almost never do team meetings to discuss things transparently to know our weaknesses and strengths in a project as a team and it creates a communication barrier.

3- she has an issue with nepotism in the office and this creates a division between people‚Äôs efforts

4- very unstable and she lets her emotions take the best of her and that influences our tiny open office sometimes with her yelling and having just overall toxic energy 

5- I get compared to the efforts of my coworker that has been longer and deals with so much more responsibility ‚Äúlook at her she came as a first graduate and shes doing this much I expected you to do more since you previous experience‚Äù kinda thing and it just is harsh and unfair because were all different in our own way

So yes that is my manager but thank god I have a coworker I can work much more comfortably with and that supports and have seen a tiny bit of my growth/value that doesn‚Äôt mean I trust her fully because she reports to her. So god knows what happens behind my back. 

With all this said, I am struggling and I make more mistakes sometimes minor ones which I am proud of hence, sometimes I dont focus much due to my ADHD and that creates an issue with fast productivity that I am trying to work on now.

Here‚Äôs how the scenario went:

I get given a client project to work on etc in 2d I hand it over for review to manager about 3 times and then we managed to finish it.

Manager snaps at me very unprofessionally and in a rude tone: ‚Äúplease tell what is happening with you, way are you doing minor mistakes like me why‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúcan we please talk privately in the meeting room‚Äù ( put in my mind our office is an open space and I felt humiliated)

Manager: ‚Äúsure‚Äù (note: she has been dodging me for almost two months ever since I joined about the meeting of my work performance because apparently ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt want to make it sensitive‚Äù which is basically utter bull shit because how else would I know and grow from there? 

Me: I have been wanting talk for so long but you kept not giving time to me. I just need you to understand that I need a little more time to adjust to software due to my high expertise being in 3d and its a transition. I am not making excuses but I am working in my skills and meeting my deadlines also getting as much help and tips from my peers. 

Manager: well, okay but I expect you to do better since you‚Äôve had previous experience but I give chances don‚Äôt worry. Look, I really like your personality and your energy in the office and you shine in other ways aside from technicalities and I wont let you go. But at the end its not my company and I dont want them to think you‚Äôre ‚Äúunder-qualified‚Äù so please focus and contain yourself more.  I am here to help too and yes I can be harsh but its for your own good. Dont be shy to ask questions and detailed ones. 

Manager: also the client called back for a few changes and it bothered because you didn‚Äôt indicate them correctly and I didn‚Äôt want to tell you..

Then she started comparing me to how I should be as better as others and I found very unprofessional coming from a manager 

Then I told her please start sharing more feedback with me about things so I can learn I really hope she does. Also I realized that they dont make apart of big clients meetings anymore which puts me in my head on the whys and make I need more time. 

I actually held a tear and after our long awaited convo I went and cried it out. Came back and still did my work.

Miscommunication is the worst thing ever. and I also feel she is doubtful of me and it worries me cause I dont want to lose this. I feel like I am working very hard and I am approving vs my first awful lost phase few weeks. 

I need advice on 1- what should I do to improve my focus level 2- what do you guys think about this entire scenario and if there is a possibility it might go wrong or its good we had this conversation so I can start making minor changes.

Do you also feel like they might let me go or was it a mind game/testing me cause I am a ‚Äútrainee‚Äù I really dont know my gut is telling me to stay and work that extra mile to impress and earn back her trust in me.

On a funnier note, I came in the next day early and she was like ‚Äúyay here she is our office dj, please bless my hears with music as we do work ‚Äù lmao I smiled and we all conversed and it was cool and weird.

Thank you all for reading!"

1066,Don‚Äôt let people stop you from doing what you want to do.,jobs,"Long story short: My redesign of my company‚Äôs task process system could go company wide if things keep up. 

Long story long(ish):
3 weeks ago I envisioned a better system at work to perform a task. I am always trying to be more efficient in everything that I do and I saw flaws in their system. 

After designing, producing, testing and getting feedback from other people, I had someone tell me ‚ÄúI like your idea but the company isn‚Äôt going to like it and you could get fired‚Äù

Shortly after, my supervisor told that he liked it and was going to propose it to his supervisor. He was just afraid of the company being upset with me doing it without their permission (all while 2 people are trying to stop him from proposing it)

Later that day I had to present it to his supervisor, which was terrifying. She said basically the same thing, she liked it but now she could get in trouble because she knows about it and I haven‚Äôt went through the proper steps. I should have came to them with the idea before I tried it. So she told me to take it all and store it until it‚Äôs time to present it (the next week possibly). 

At this point I was discouraged because my system had no apparent issues and was more efficient. Also, other people used my system because it was better so I felt like I let them down.

Right before I got off, I was told to wait before leaving so I could present it to the next supervisor(the 2nd highest in the building who everyone said was the one to look out for). She asked alot of questions and challenged the idea, but I had an answer for everything (because it had been 3 weeks of using it) She also asked why I came up with it so I had to explain my thought process. 

She loved the idea and told me that she was throughly impressed and wanted me to come in the next day so I could do tests on something that she had concerns about, but if everything worked she wanted to get it rolled out right away, to possibly all 6 locations across the US to become the new standard.

Today I designed and conducted 3 different tests (with all of the variables) and evaluated the data of 30 samples, all by myself. While the results are more confusing than I imagined, this is huge for me as I can use this experience to help me in any job in the future."

1071,Need some advice on leaving my job,jobs,"Hi,  I put in my notice to leave my current job about a week ago. 

Since I put in my notice to my manager, I've informed co-workers I closely worked with along with those who I am closer to on a personal level.

Given the number of people I've told, the news of my departure is well-known among the firm, even among those who I haven't directly communicated with.

There are still various senior and junior personnel who I've worked with some, but not closely, who I haven't personally told about my departure although it's likely they know. It's standard custom at my firm to send out a departure email on an employees last day, which I plan to do.

My question is if it's fine to not bother with telling senior personnel who I've worked with that I'm leaving in a 1x1 call or scenario and just group them in with the general goodbye email. At this point, they already know I'm leaving and I'll send out the standard goodbye email to the whole firm. I want to leave on good terms, but don't think it adds much at this point to tell these people in a 1x1 scenario (they certainly would not do the reverse)."
1072,Boss blames me for their own short-comings....,jobs,"I'd could write a book about everything that happened  at work this year, but long story short, my team split at the end of 2020 to help onboard a new block of business, and left me and one other coworker in charge of doing quality on a call center dept that took 6 people to have sufficient coverage. Leadership got super caught up in the new block and started canceling our collaboration meetings to go over procedures and team standards so we could all be in sink, canceled one on one meetings so that they went from monthly to quarterly, and made our only contact with the rest of leadership and our team a chat room that was almost never looked at. When we tried to ask for help, we were told someone would help, then no one ever reached out, or they told us it was a non-issue and we could handle it ourselves. 

Fast-forward to our annual review, I really thought I did a good job of saying that two people accomplished quality for a dept that required 6 people for sufficient coverage for a year, with minimal assistance. I tried to say it in a way that showed that we basically problem solved our way through this whole thing so leadership could focus on the new business. If I assigned blame, I made sure to justify why something couldn't be done to assist. 

My supervisor turned it completely around on me and basically blamed me for any short coming that occurred. And SPECIFICALLY me. I even asked my coworker. He got a perfect score. He also didn't say anything. He just pretended everything was ok b/c we'd both learned that trying to say something was wrong would be treated as an overreaction. My eval didn't have a SINGLE positive note. Not even that I was given the more difficult tasks because of my seniority AND trained my coworker b/c he had only been working for the company for 3 months prior to 2021. They essentially said, here are all the ""Adversities"" you said you overcame, and here is how it was all Atlas' own fault."" They even mentioned an incident that happened at the beginning of the year where we had told them there was an issue with the metrics FOR THREE DAYS before anyone did anything, and said that I (Atlas) waited until the problem was out of control before telling someone. I told them AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED! And kept telling them for three days! And they told me everything was fine. They even said I struggle to maintain my composure and overreact to small inconveniences! I only asked for help when I physically did not have access to fix something on my own (ie. didn't have permissions from the software to edit a system b/c I wasn't a TL or supervisor). I held this whole team down with the help of a NH for a year, with only 6 months experience prior, with minimal help. They even have admitted that we didn't get the help we should have gotten. And they had the gall to go back and say all the problems we had this last year are exclusively MY fault?!Maybe this is my fault, because when they had that meeting where they finally met with us in November, when they said ""We're glad we could finally get this figured out. Now we can hopefully move past this."" I knew it meant ""Now that we've finally gotten you to stop your shouting, we will never speak of this again."" If anything, I should have done what my coworker did, and acted like everything was kosher."

Definition of offshoring - American companies hiring foreign workers to work remotely for jobs that American workers could be doing. Or the company sets up manufacturing or office overseas.

- Did you work in IT and an entire division was closed and then reopened overseas?

I was pretty much hired and working before the checks were even submitted.
I'm worried because I've had mixed answers about the disqualifications. I'm thinking I might be alright however, I have a few dings on my record that this job might not prefer, however it's nothing that is specifically a disqualification. 
I'm just worried about what happens if I am asked or not allowed to continue working because of this? My plan is to just be honest if asked, I have no problem with that. But I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"

I missed the call, but whomever they were left a voice message (I don't even know what to call this person because they failed to mention their position/title). Their voice message was very dry, and the person's energy was a bit off. They seemed very apathetic and just... ""dull""- that was a red flag for me. 

Hours later, I proceeded to call back. No answer, but they called back seconds later. The person answers, says their name and ask how could they help me. I told them that I received a voice message and am calling about a job opening. She asks for my name. I told her. She asked ""When can you come in for an interview?"". I replied ""Do you have any openings for next week?"". She mutters incoherently about sending in an email and starts to tell me the email address. I politely ask her to please hold while I get a pen. She didn't say anything(which felt weird. A ""sure, take your time"" or ""yeah, no problem"" would have been nice). Silence ensures while I get a pen. Then I'm like ""okay, I'm ready"" and when she starts talking again, she's laughing as she talks and I can hear a guy in the background laughing as well. She told me the email address, and said to send an email and we'll set up a date from there. 


Uuuhmmm, fucking what!?!? 
What was the point of the phone call, when you could have easily sent me an email at first!?!?!! 

I do not like that lady, there is something very off about her. She gives off bully and condescending energy. Not only that, she seems VERY unprofessional. 


I don't think I am going to send in an email, but I don't know if I am over-thinking.

I was severely isolated growing up AND homeschooled, so I struggled a lot with depression and loneliness, and completely missed out on enjoying my middle school &amp; high school years, so I‚Äôm only just now able to kind of make up for lost time.

I solved two prompts. One estimation question which I struggled to answer, and another product design question which I answered confidently.

However, I just feel sooooo guilty leaving my current job.

1. My boss is so dang nice and has done so much for me. Currently he is advocating for me to go full time sometime this year (which I do NOT want to do at this job. I'd feel stuck).

2. My boss got me this job. I knew him from a previous place that I had worked. He has also given me many wonderful opportunities. 

3. He and the big boss love me and think I am going to make a career out of this job. I do NOT want to be stuck here like at all.

I am afraid they will try to low ball me, and I don't want to ask for less than this job is worth. There aren't comparable jobs to seek salaries on places like Glassdoor etc. Would it be inappropriate to ask the person who used to be in this position what they started at so I can get an idea of what to expect and ask for?"

Since day 1 I have been excluded from meetings and information that is important for me to be able to grow as an employee. I've discussed it with management and nothing is changing.

My concern is that I was fired from my last job for ""not being a good fit"". I was let go after 1 poor review  (out of 2 years of positive reviews, some of those positive reviews coming after my poor review). However it does not seem that performance was the true reason I was let go, as I specifically asked if that was the reason and HR refused to answer.

My concern is that with being fired from my last job and only having 7 months into my new job that it will be difficult to get hired. This is my 3rd job, my last 2 I stayed for ~2 years each.

I received an instant reply and was informed I was the only candidate they had interviewed so far, and needed to interview a few others before making a decision. Was told to stay tuned for updates- I thanked them for the prompt response. 
It‚Äôs now been ~10 days since that exchange, should I follow up again, or not bother? Interviews went great (4 total including initial screening) and received positive feedback every step of the way.

1131,I got 2 interview invitations but the interviewer is the same person. What should I do?,jobs," 

Hello guys,

I applied to one company and its mother company. both positions are similar and I got an interview invitation from both of them. The problem is that the interviewer is the same guy...!  
What should I do in this case? Should I give up one interview or just do an interview? or should I ask the HR manager? I'm a bit freaked out about this problem because maybe I can be failed from both interviews even before I do it.

I hope you can give me wise advise, Thank you in advance."

I am interested in hearing opinions on anyone who has a job related in these fields. I would love to work in something related to the field while going to school that I could make a decent living off of, currently make $16 an hour, so just trying to pay bills and have a little savings. I know I would have to go to some training or school to start off in a job. Would even be fine having a second job. Any jobs that doesn‚Äôt require a degree till I finish school or require an associates degree, can start working towards a training program so I can start off somewhere? Do you like your job? Any advice? Thank you."

I ask because I just have the feeling of, if people are approaching me and saying do you want a job, it‚Äôs too good to be true because before it was myself that would have to look around for a job but now I‚Äôm suddenly getting people coming up to me.

Are these jobs actual jobs or maybe not jobs from good companies?"

1136,Need to ask for a letter of recommendation from a former employer but also turn down their job offer. Not sure about the proper way to do this,jobs,"I am graduating from college this spring. Last summer I had an internship where, at the end of the summer, they offered me a full time job for when I graduated. I was very thankful for the offer and made sure they knew this, but when they first brought it up and when I got the official offer in September, I deferred my decision and talked openly with them about my reasons for my hesitancy. The job would be far away from home for me, and I'm currently a bit of a caretaker for my parents. But the main factor I told them why I may not take it is that I have always wanted to pursue a graduate degree.

They were very understanding and asked that I reach back out with my decision around February. Now a few months later, nearing the deadline I was given, I know for sure that graduate school next year is what I want to do. However, for my applications I need letters of recommendation. I think my former supervisor from this summer would be one of my best sources for this, especially since online learning somewhat limited the number of professors I got to know. I'm wondering what the best way to go about asking for this letter of recommendation while also turning down their job offer would be. It's a bit of an awkward situation. I think if I ask for the letter first, it will seem like I am avoiding the elephant in the room. But if I turn down the offer first, it may cause ill feelings making him not want to write the letter. However, if I'm asking for a recommendation letter for graduate school, it definitely implies that I wouldn't be working the full time position."

1139,Is this the right choice?,jobs,"I‚Äôm currently a full time college student and work part time. I originally planned to come back Saturday and work, but I had a few schedule changes and don‚Äôt believe I can go back right now. 

I‚Äôve contacted my boss to set up two meetings now which she confirmed. The only thing is, she never called me or picked up the phone when I tried to call her. 

I feel like‚Ä¶ if you can‚Äôt give me 15 minutes of day to call your employee why should I work for you? In short I‚Äôm considering quitting now.  Would that be wrong?"
1140,which option do I pick?,jobs,"So here‚Äôs my situation:
I applied to a job as a joke thinking I wouldn‚Äôt get it. Fast forward a couple of interviews, and I have a signed offer letter. And it comes with a 17% Salary increase. The team is nice, and my job duties are things I‚Äôve done before so that‚Äôs not an issue. It is a farther commute, and I would have to be in office all day which I‚Äôm not really looking forward to. The perks seem pretty basic but it‚Äôs nothing bad.

My current company is great, I love working here, and the perks are about the same as the other proposed company. I tried using the offer letter to leverage a higher salary and it got shot down at the executive level. My boss and my bosses‚Äô boss were all for it. They really like me and want to keep on. And I really like working here.

The main reason I want to change jobs is the bump in salary, I‚Äôve had a lot of dental bills that I‚Äôve been paying in full (After Insurance) I only use a debit card and that‚Äôs made my bank account very very sad. I know I can afford to get out of this hole being smart with my money for a couple weeks. But the pay bump would help significantly. I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point

TLDR: I'm in a small financial hole, I enjoy my company but they don't pay as much, I got an offer letter from another company that has a 17% pay increase. But I have a bad feeling about the offer."
1141,Promotion and raise just before a scheduled interview with another company.,jobs,"My fiance has been job hunting for a better situation for a few months.

She eventually wants private sector but thinks it may be better to wait a few months now to make sure it shows up on her resume (she's been promoted 3 times in 2 years, looks good). 

How should she approach this interview? Does she explain the situation? Obviously her pay range preferred will be different now. Looking for best strategy to maintain bridges, increase pay as much as possible, and bolster resume strength."

1143,what to do when offered a job but may be more interested in a different job?,jobs,"I just started looking for a new job a couple of weeks ago and the search has been going better than expected. I was contacted by half the places I applied to for an interview. It sounds like I'm close to an offer at one of them after only one interview. I'm not sure what I should do if they do offer me the job though.

The pay is decent, about 20% more than I was making at my old job. The benefits are really nice too. Lots of sick time and the option to work a 4 day week instead of 5. They also allow you to work from home occasionally. And no covid vaccine mandates whatsoever! (I lost my previous job due to their new vaccination policy.)

However, the job sounds completely dull, though less stressful than my last job. I'd be strictly working with the elderly which is okay but I'd prefer to work with families with kids. It also involves a lot of phone calls (which I dislike) and occasionally going to people's houses, likely in some rough neighborhoods, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.

The other job I have a second interview scheduled for tomorrow. It sounds like a much more interesting job and even like it could occasionally be fun. It would involve way less phone calls and I'd be working with families. I'd also get to organize events for the families and I love that.

The problem with the second job is it pays about what I was making previously, maybe an extra $1 an hour. I'd also have to work a 5 day schedule and wouldn't be able to work from home at all. The company seems like it doesn't treat its employees as well from the reviews either. I'd also have to get weekly covid tests which isn't a deal breaker but it is a bit of a nuisance. 

I just don't know what I should do if I get offered the first job. I definitely don't want to accept the job then back out if I get offered the 2nd one too. But I also feel like I'm not in a position to turn down a job since I'm out of work atm and I may not even get offered the other job. And the benefits are so good at the first job it might still be the better option even though I wouldn't like the work itself as much.

Has anybody been in a similar position? Which choice did you make and did you regret it? What would you do in my shoes?"
1144,Should I apply for this job again?,jobs,[removed]
1145,Work Covid policy,jobs,"So, I tested positive back on January 2nd, and used all my sick leave and PTO to cover for 4 missing work days. I can‚Äôt go back to work till I test negative, and from what my doctor is saying and placed in the note, I can be testing positive for 90+ days after symptoms are gone. The company I work for says that it has to be the PCR test and must be documented.

While I‚Äôm glad that the company I work for is taking Covid seriously, I cant be in this limbo for 90 days.

I‚Äôm thinking my next steps are to talk to HR and see if they can do anything else, or do I just need to file for unemployment? 

What does everyone else think?"
1146,"If it felt good in your gut, did you get the job?",jobs,"I had quite a nice remote interview today for a full time position. 

The hiring manager is someone I have worked with and collaborated well in the past. He arranged a meeting with the team and the company owner. I really enjoyed talking with them and the conversation flowed comfortably. The owner said openly that he was really happy with the interview and my work (they saw my portfolio). Then the hiring manager asked for references. They gave me a specific day when I'm going to hear back from them. After the interview I felt really energised and happy. 

I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket, and I'm also talking with another company that would be interested in giving me freelance work. 

But is this good gut feeling a good predictor of whether or not you got the job?"
1147,Am I being paid fairly?,jobs,"Graduated in May 2021 with a BBA in business analytics. Currently working for a large nonprofit healthcare system in the southwest. I have 7 years of experience in healthcare in a pharm tech role from when I was in high school/college. I do analytics type stuff for my company‚Äôs pharmacies. I get reports from multiple sources and import into ssms database, run queries on them, do a couple of calculations to get financial information and projections (very basic and my boss tells me the calculations to do, I just build them into the report) then when I get the results I create and connect to a powerBI report that I refresh every week. At this point I have not learned how to automate the data import into the database because my boss just keeps assigning me more projects with short turnaround times. I originally was just supposed to help get set up for only one of my company‚Äôs new pharmacies but I introduced powerBI in my dept and they wanted me to work with other pharmacies and other parts of the org such as labs. The data sets are usually in the thousands, but I just did a project where I was working with 8 million rows. No one in my dept has this technical knowledge, my coworkers do only controlled substance auditing and are getting paid around the same as me. Their work is very basic and easy compared to mine (I know because 25% of my workload is also cs auditing).  I have created 6 databases/dashboards in the past 6 months, with the first four done in the first month alone. There was a huge learning curve for me especially since I had no one to reach out to for help (my bosses are healthcare professionals with little technical knowledge). 

Yesterday, I had my 6 month review. I am very aware that there is a lot I don‚Äôt know as a recent grad, but my boss gave me perfect reviews on everything. I am making around 55k per year. I requested a salary adjustment to 75k and backed it up with proof of my accomplishments and how I was able to automate our auditing process. My boss looked at me like I was crazy and said she‚Äôll look into it. I don‚Äôt think I am being crazy and let her know that these skills are very in demand especially in healthcare and that I see at least 5 new job openings for similar roles nearly every day. Did I do the right thing and is this a fair amount to ask for? I‚Äôm not sure what to do with a $1600 paycheck and this is only $200-300 more per paycheck than I was making working at Walmart."
1148,Can I use a past job title as the head of my resume instead of a current job title?,jobs,"I'm applying for a job as an account manager. In the past I worked for a massage company. I started out as a salesman and moved up to the operational manager within a year. The business cleared $1million profit (for the first time) the year I operated the business. However the business shut down due to covid and due to the fact that the owner jumped into an industry that he believed would be more lucrative. The job I have now is as a shift leader at a coffeehouse. It doesn't exactly sounds as cool as ""Operational Manager"""
1149,I feel like a fool for inquiring about these things before I‚Äôve started the job. Opinions?,jobs,"I don‚Äôt know how to word this without sounding like a complete fool. So I‚Äôm just going to write what comes out.

I‚Äôve gotten a job offer. I am interested in this job. However, when I applied for the job, I didn‚Äôt know if the lunch was going to be 30 mins or an hour. I figured I‚Äôd go to the interview and find out. It turned out that it was a 30 min lunch. Right now, I‚Äôm working somewhere that has allowed me to go home and let my dog out. Sometimes this takes longer than 30 minutes if it‚Äôs snowing or has diarrhea. This hasn‚Äôt been a problem with my current employer.

The new job is 12 mins out and 12 minutes back. My options are to gracefully turn the job down or see if they are willing to work with me on a longer lunch. I feel like this is something I should‚Äôve mentioned at the interview. The only reason I didn‚Äôt was because I thought that if I got the job offer then I‚Äôd have more bargaining power. Now I just feel stupid for not bringing it up in the interview and the anxiety is getting to me.

I wish that was it but there is more. 

The second thing is that there is a chance that depending on the work schedule, I might end up with a conflicting work schedule with my partner. As in, I leave for work before he gets home, I get home when he‚Äôs asleep, I wake up after he‚Äôs left. There might be times where I could get an earlier shift and see him when he comes home. I just don‚Äôt know what schedule I‚Äôll end up with. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to be consistent or if it‚Äôs going to be all over the place. I would like to develop some sort of healthy sleep schedule. So there‚Äôs that too. 

Lastly, there is a chance that I might be the only manager in the store. At my current job, I cannot leave the store if I‚Äôm the only manager. That only happens once a week and my partner is already home to let the dog out. 

I don‚Äôt know how often I will be required to be to only manager in the store. It might be once a week, it could be three times a week. The problem being that if my partner isn‚Äôt already home, and I can‚Äôt leave the store, then I can‚Äôt go home to let the dog out. 

I sound COMPLETELY ridiculous. I feel like I should turn the job down. My partner thinks that if I‚Äôm not going to take the job then I should at least communicate and try to negotiate the lunches and get more information on the schedule. I‚Äôve got nothing to lose, right? 

I just feel like I‚Äôm already being a problem and I haven‚Äôt even been onboarded. I should‚Äôve brought these things up in the interview. I should‚Äôve inquired about their scheduling needs to know what kind of schedule I‚Äôd be looking at. 

I feel like I‚Äôve made a mess and this is a terrible way to start."

1153,PwC Audit Summer Internship offer - should I cancel other audit internship applications?,jobs,"I'm a 2nd (penultimate) year university student from the UK and I've been applying to summer internships. I got an offer from PwC to do an audit internship this summer (yay). The other companies I applied to (and didn't get rejected from yet) for audit are Tilney Smith and Williamson, KPMG and BDO. I've applied for other internships too, mainly in actuarial, since I'm interested in becoming an actuary. However I'm not sure what job I want to do after uni - hopefully doing an internship will help me decide.

I have an assessment centre with Tilney Smith and Williamson on the 24th-25th January. My question is, since I already received an offer from PwC for audit, should I cancel this assessment centre? A PwC internship is better than a Tilney Smith and Williamson one, right? Also, my uni is really slow with finalising the timetable, so I may have to miss a lecture in order to make the assessment centre. And if KPMG or BDO offer me assessment centres should I cancel them too? 

I'm still planning to keep applying for actuarial internships. I've applied and not been rejected from Aon, Legal &amp; General, Isio, AIG, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson, so I'm going to see if I get any offers from those, because I think I'd rather do an actuarial internship than an audit one (not sure though). Are some of these internships worse options than the PwC audit internship?

Thank you for any advice!"
1154,Can I put two workplaces in one pay stub?,jobs,"Hello everybody!

My friends and I are planning a trip to Norway, and we need to apply for visas to go there. The whole process seems terrifying to me. But, I spoke to a couple of people who have already been there and even lived there for a while. Many of them recommend providing pay stubs as additional documents. They say that it helps to get the accelerate the whole process. Besides, they will see that I have a well-paid job in the embassy, and nothing will make me want to stay in their country illegally.

Also, I‚Äôve heard that some countries might reject a visa application without any explanation. So, it‚Äôs highly recommended to provide as many additional documents as possible, including the proof of income. I know that Norway is a costly country. Indeed, even 1K bucks are not considered as money there, and you can easily waste them. But, I wanna enjoy my holidays and plan to see many things there, going to different places. So, I don‚Äôt wanna live on a tight budget.

At the moment, I have two jobs. One is my main job, and I work in the office, like many others. But, in the meantime, I also work as a fitness instructor in one gym. It‚Äôs not like a job, but more like a paid hobby for me. But the gym where I go, know that I go there every day, and people even ask me for some advice, that‚Äôs why the manager there offered me a part-time job there and flexible office hours. In addition to that, I also have my own YouTube channel where I talk about workouts and nutrition. It also brings me some income, and I even pay taxes.

So, I would like to put all my jobs into one pay stub and submit it with the rest of the documents. My office boss told me he could provide me with a pay stub that only reflects my office job, and he doesn‚Äôt care about the rest. I found an online paystub tool, and I would like to put everything there. Still, I dunno, whether I should submit an unsigned form or ask all my employers to sign it. Besides, what should I do with my YouTube channel then?

So, thank you for your time reading all this. Hopefully, you can suggest me something."

However, I‚Äôm feeling incredibly burnt out, unfortunately, didn‚Äôt set boundaries when I started (first job, non-confrontational) and despite me bringing up my concerns since then they haven‚Äôt been addressed so I feel really taken advantage of.

I‚Äôm worried about a few things though:

1. How much notice is appropriate to give my nanny family? (No I don‚Äôt have a contract - yes I now know I was stupid)
2. Should I quit before I have a job lined up? I feel that my main transferrable skills have been developed in my nanny job, so I would need my nanny family to be my main reference - not sure how I would ask them to be a reference before they know I‚Äôm quitting.
3. Since I also live with the family I work for, I‚Äôm stressed about the whole quitting and instantly having to find a new place. None of my family live in my state so I can‚Äôt just go back home. Could possibly stay with friends for a very short period. 
4. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any insight on difficulty landing an entry-level role in the health field? I know my work experience is very limited and is not necessarily the best look on a resume so I feel like I shot myself in the foot with my decision-making two years ago. 

Sorry if this is confusing to read but I feel so overwhelmed and alone. Would really appreciate any advice!

1163,Have a good amount of skills but don't know what kind of jobs I should look for.,jobs,"I've been working as a construction estimator for about 7 years and it's just become...bad.  I've become an expert at this proprietary design software that is extremely clunky and difficult to use, but basically serves the purpose of fully engineering building components before they get sealed by engineers.

Also my workplace is just abysmal, everyone's always getting sick, it's dirty, the water cooler tastes disgusting/moldy and it's just become a really bad environment to work in and I'm struggling a lot with motivation.  Also the pay just isn't keeping up with my living expenses and they've been super cagey about raises even though my manager left a year ago.

The problem is, I feel very specialized even though I have a pretty broad skillset.  In my job alone I've worked with my hellish design software (that I constantly have to figure workarounds and bug fixes for), served as a de facto project manager, estimated and won hundreds of projects, I know how to do takeoffs and square foot things, get quotes and work all of this into spreadsheets and wrote proposals.  I've reviewed and signed purchase orders and communicated with customers.

In my personal life I have a good handle over computers, have built my own and maintained my own operating system (Arch Linux) and I have my own website that I administrate through SSH and a VPS.  I also know how to work with tools, measurements and some other labor jazz.

So I'm on the east coast and I have this pretty big skillset but I'm overwhelmed and don't even know what to start looking for.  I would like to go from making 67.5k a year to 80-90k making a transition because that would really ease up my expenses.  If I'm working in proprietary software I would like for it to at the very least not be absolutely painful and crashing all the time, but I don't know if my experience is common.  I would be fine with working in construction again, especially in structural steel, but I'm certainly fine with looking at industry changes, just don't know how applicable all this could be.

I would not be doing the same things for each client, I will be coming off of those accounts as their representative but will still have to deal with them phone calls and all that stuff. 

I‚Äôm torn at what I should do, I‚Äôve been talking about how much I hate my job with everyone I know for months now, and would rather just work somewhere completely different or change my career but I really just don‚Äôt know if I can afford to turn down the money. 

Also, being salaried will force me to stay much longer every day especially because I have to make sure everyone on the team is good to go and people end up staying till 9 PM a lot. I do not want to sacrifice my life for work, I fucking hate work. I want to work for myself and own a gym but there‚Äôs no way for me to accumulate money without working a regular job first. 

TL;DR - I hate my job, my boss wants me to be a team lead, that will be a salaried position and force me to stay possibly 10 hours a day five days a week and some weekends. That is the absolute opposite of what I would look for in a job but the pay bump would be insane in terms of what I have been making. (30-45% increase vs. my current salary)"
1167,I turned down a prestigious job in finance because I had a bad feeling that they were going to work me to death/not treat me well. Should you trust your gut?,jobs,"I‚Äôm 4 years out of college, worked in public accounting, and now work in private accounting. I make about $95k all-in and my job is chill (30-55 hours/week) and 90% remote. The downside is that I am learning nothing at work. 

I recently turned down an $80k (+$10k bonus) buy side equity research job at a boutique firm in a MCOL/HCOL area because they said some things that made me nervous. They were nice in person but their emails after I got the offer were subtly aggressive. 
I know the industry requires long hours but during the interview process they showed me their calendar of their earnings season and nearly every day started at 6am and stopped past 10pm. They said that at their company, you don‚Äôt have to work past midnight. I don‚Äôt mind those hours but they require 100% in-person work for all their staff. Also they implied I had to check emails all the time but they don‚Äôt provide a work phone. They also cautioned me that I had less experience than everyone else and needed to work extra hard. 

Their 401k match is 3% vests 20% only after 3 years of working there and doesn‚Äôt fully vest until 8 years. HR said that their CEO recently implemented an 8-week maternity leave policy and that you have the option to wfh for one day/week due to the Omicron variant. HR also emailed me at midnight after I was offered the job which alarmed me. Also she sent me the job offer at 9pm on New Year‚Äôs Eve. 

Aside from these tangibles, the entire firm has no men of color, only two women of color who are in support roles, and no one under the age of 30. They haven‚Äôt hired since 2019 and 2 of the 3 most recently-departed employees have been Asian. I happen to be an Asian American woman. 

One positive is that everyone at this company has an extremely impressive resume and the office is close to home. It was my chance to leave accounting but my gut feeling was telling me that I‚Äôll be worked to death? I know that the earning potential in accounting is far lower than in equity research."
1168,"Job Offer in Malta, Europe",jobs,"Hey guys, really need your advice here. I've been working for 2.5 years now as a engineer in Asia. &amp; I've been looking around for better job prospects. Feeling stuck in my current company due to over working (late nights in production line until 12am, coming in weekends, replying emails even at home) and my department manager is not being supportive of my professional development. 

I recently took the leap and starting looking to see what's out there. Started applying last week and already gotten 5 callbacks! I've finished 3 of them this week &amp; I just got offered a new job in Malta! I've only ever been to 2 other countries in my 27 years of age. Both in Asia and not far from me. I would say I'm a hermit. But I want to take more risks and explore to see what's out there. 

Can anyone please take a look at my package below and see if its worthy of moving there?

- 32K annual gross salary
- 24 annual leave days
- 1 month salary relocation compensation
- extra 3 months salary relocation compensation IF I complete 3 years with them
- 2 way airflight ticket

(1.7K after tax - 800 rent - 500 grocery - 50 bus = 350 leftover which isn't much considering there's no profit sharing and me having to fly back to Asia for family visits)

I also have medical condition where I need hormonal medication every month. But from the medical coverage policy, it doesn't seem to cover medicine dispensary. What's the policy like in Malta for foreigners visiting the clinic/hospital for medications? Do we have to pay?

I'm not sure if I should keep looking or accept this role.

The HR has been really pushy for me to accept citing that I will have really good growth with the manager and living costs in Malta is super low unlike other EU countries. He was also quite insistent that I respond to him by tomorrow ALTHOUGH he just offered me last night. I requested for more time until Monday for me to think because it's a MASSIVE deal to move to a bloody new continent. But he was really pushing saying needs answer right away. This is putting  a lot of stress on me.

Honestly from what I'm seeing, ¬£32K is low. I'm connected to a HR manager in an MNC audit firm in Malta. He mentioned that their most junior auditor fresh out of university earns ¬£45K from the get go. Which is the totally opposite in my country where engineers are paid higher than auditors. Also, this new role doesn't provide profit sharing, bonus, discount on company stock purchase which I'm having now. 

I'm unsure what to do. Am I missing some level of perspectives here? Pay is meh, potential career growth is possible.

Would really appreciate your advice here party people."
1169,The interviewer is also going to be my coworker?,jobs,"I recently had an interview that was strange and I wanted to ask if this is typical or even possibly a red flag and to avoid this position? 

The interview was conducted by the ‚Äúhiring manager‚Äù who informed me that she works in an office with one other individual and is looking to add a third person. 
Essentially, she is hiring and going to be training the person she hires to do what she does. 
She made a comment that she needs to be sure whoever she hires is trustworthy because they‚Äôre currently mostly working remote and she doesn‚Äôt want to send someone unreliable home with a computer monitor and equipment. 
This is a healthcare outsourcing office and the position is for clinical coordinator. I‚Äôm a little uneasy about how small the work group is and I‚Äôm afraid of work environments that feel too personal. Is it a red flag that one person is in charge of both hiring and training and then will also be working with me in the same office in the same position once COVID improves?"

1173,Question for fellow Americans. Why are a lot of people obsessed with a career or dream job?,jobs,"Just a general question. Obviously doesn't apply to everyone but I've noticed on Reddit and even in person that so many people are obsessed with their jobs to the point where their family comes second. I do understand not wanting to be stuck in a dead end job or a job that makes you miserable, but why the obsession? My general approach to jobs has always been this: Can you tolerate it? Is the pay enough for you to provide? How are the benefits? How are the working hours? 

To me work is just work because at the end of the day I go to my family and thats the most important thing for me. Plus time for hobbies. I moderately enjoy my job. Its easy, pays well, no micromanagement, offers solid benefits and a good schedule.  No matter what I do for a living it never beats being the family protector.  So I just want to say to those getting anxious about not knowing what to do with their life:

BREATHE. The human experience doesn't have a blueprint. There's no guaranteed rules for success. Try different things out. Don't be afraid to take a risk. Learn what's most important in life."

1175,What's the secret to a promotion? What do you talk about in your 1-on-1's?,jobs,"I'm about to enter a new career opportunity soon, but before I do, I wanted to give my current industry one more shot. So even though I have a job lined up a couple months from now, I thought I would take the remaining time I have left to eek out a job hop. That being said, while it's unlikely that I would get promoted in such a short amount of time, I've always had a natural knack and inclination for knowing right away once I do the job if I would like it, has promotion material and upward social mobility. The reason I know this is because of the on-boarding process. If the role or opportunity can't even on-board you properly, and it's just a go shadow this employee, that employee, you can generally assume that your role is simple-minded and not challenging. This has been my experience. 

  
That being said, what is the secret to getting promotions and moving up the social corporate ladder? is it a combination of many factors? Such as excelling in your role, but also utilizing the 1-on-1's with your manager to let them know? I've always thought that if they wanted to promote me, they should come find me. But I was speaking to a former mentor, and she mentioned one of the ways that she was quickly able to get a promotion almost yearly was to right away make a 30-60-90 day game plan with her supervisor/director and talk about the things necessary she needed to learn, build, so that she could approach that next level.   


it didn't even occur to me that 1-on-1's were utilized in this way, but now that I think about it, it does seem smart. Many of my 1-on-1's were used to talk about my feelings, a recap of what I did that week, and things I want to do. But never once did I mention that I wanted to be promoted. Was this my mistake?"

What do now?,jobs,"So I applied for a position I was really excited about in December and after completing some tasks I was rushed into an interview the next day - they said that they wanted to get someone into the post by January 10th.

I felt like the interview went really well. I'm a career changer but I think I aced the tasks and I had a really positive conversation about transferrable skills etc and I came away thinking that I was in with a good shot. 

In the meantime, I actually got offered another role so I reached out to the first company and let them know and asked what their decision timeline would look like and they said they hoped to have an answer by 4th Jan. Based on this I turned down the other offer (obviously I knew I was hedging my bets here but I preferred the first job). Another 2 weeks went by and I still hadn't heard from the first company so I dropped them a line and they just said that the application process was still ongoing and they didn't give me any indication of when I would hear back. 

Fast-forward to today and I've just noticed that the job has been re-listed on their website and across all the job boards. They've never told me that I didn't get the role and they've been generally pretty good at replying to emails (although they haven't given me much information). I'm just wondering what this all means? 

Has anyone got some insight into what might be going on?"
1189,Leaving a job soon and want to flag up bad management. Can I do it by emailing the executive director of the department or do I need to go through HR?,jobs,"Tldr: it is a very long post because I wanted to give as much background as possible. I am too young and don't have much experience in the world of work to know how to deal with the situations described below. The short version is that management at my cleaning work is incompetent and this makes my colleagues miserable. Many are leaving. I want to address my concerns to an executive director but maybe it should instead be addressed to HR. The exec director seems like a man who appreciates the ""small"" workers whereas I have the feeling HR will just ignore the issue. Could you give me any advice?








So a bit of background.
I (20ish F) am a university student and work part time on a zero hour contract as a cleaner for my Uni. 
My colleagues are a mix of employees on a contract and temp workers like me.


We have been in a dire shortage of staff and been given double and triple the amount of work which with Omicron has been becoming exponentially worse. Our supervisor, instead of sticking up for us in front of management, comes along and cleans even though she's not allowed to. While I do respect her hard work, I, as well as all my colleagues, are incredibly disappointed in her ability to manage her role as a supervisor. Instead of flagging the issues that the work is becoming unmanageable due staff shortages, she covers them by giving us an increasing amount of demands and joining in with the work so long she keeps the managers happy. I.e. she has no backbone and does whatever management says.


Then there is, then, the issue of the manager at the building I am working at, who, even though everyone is working as hard as they can, never says one good word to staff and complains daily to the supervisor about tiny things that no other building manager cares for, and to be honest, this is the reason no other supervisor (or cleaner for that matter) wants to work at that building. This man also had no shame in contacting one of the covering supervisors on her personal phone, which she has given in case of an EMERGENCY, to complain about standards not being met this week (mind you, a lot of people are off with Omicron or on holiday still so standards are bound to fall when there is no back up staff)


Then our departments managers (different to the building manager) have been treating my colleagues with utter disrespect. Guilt tripping them for taking holiday, moving supervisors between buildings as a punishment for them speaking up about struggling with the amount of work etc etc



All of this has No impact on me whatsoever, because I don't have a family to look after, I can quit whenever I want, as a student on a zero hour contract I can decide not to go to work if I have an assignment and they can tell me nothing and so on. Also, as I am significantly younger than my colleagues, I can finish my work (even when given triple the amount) in half the time needed. But this is only because I have a healthy body and work part time. Many of my colleagues are older and work 9+ h per day...




So why am I writing all this.. 



I am fed up with looking at my colleagues being treated as literal slaves by incapable managers that don't understand that cleaning a massive building is not like hoovering your room at home. I have seen a woman who used to work for years in the hotel services business, a cheerful, outspoken and strong woman, be completely shut down and broken
.. Another woman having to quit work because of a medical condition related to her shoulder, because of overworking herself with no proper break... a supervisor, that is not afraid to stand up for her staff, taking days for mental health issues and breaking down in her office because she feels bad about giving so much work to her staff ... and not even one nice or encouraging word from either of the managers. Only complaints and criticism.



A lot of staff are currently looking for new jobs and soon most of my team will probably have left. I hope it will be a wake up call for the managers.
I personally am leaving in a couple months as I need to focus on my studies. 



So I was thinking, there is this man, the executive director of the department our cleaning services are part of. He seems like a man that thinks ""lowly"" staff like us should be treated with respect. I was wondering whether it would be appropriate to email or message him on LinkedIn about my disappointment with management and some supervisors. I don't know whether mentioning names would be appropriate or just giving a general feedback would be better.
Or whether contacting this man is ok inappropriate and instead I should speak to HR?



Again, it has nothing to do with me. I don't care, I'll be gone in 2 months. I just want someone to inspect the work of these managers, because for so many staff to be leaving and feeling depressed, it must be to to with management.



But then I am worried about this backfiring. 



Please, is there a way I can make a change? It hurts seeing my colleagues so unhappy and broken... 



Disclaimer..
I joined in October.  The problematic managers were pretty much hired at some point in the last 2-3 years. Most of my colleagues have been working for Uni for more than 10+ years and have said they were very happy and proud to be working for such a good institution. All until management changed and now people are leaving and no new staff is hired."

Couple of months ago I accepted new job offer. Regardless of the area I work in, I have had some period in which I only did a freelance work because of my health issues, so this is my first job after a period of over a year. Before that I had done a slightly different things, but comparable and in the same industry. Nevertheless, I am currently at a Junior position in that company.

When I came there, they wanted me to do some project that didn't come through. Since then I had couple of smaller tasks, one of which is still blocked from completion by other people, and two others I have completed, with some issues, because when I asked for more details needed to complete the task I was shown some other task and told to copy that (and in the end it wasn't that simple so I had to redo the whole thing).

Right now I have a lot of free time at work, waiting around for another project and it's leaving me filling underutilized and anxious about my future here. I also feel like even if I would be offered permanent post here, I have no idea how to decide because I don't know how to evaluate if I want to stay based on my experiences.

I wonder if any of you had such experiences at work and how did you handle that. I am kind of thinking that I want to leave, but I could use the money and it makes me feel like a quitter üòÖ

Also, from the point of HR and recruitment - how would you look at person that has gap in employment followed by failed trial period ?

Because of the industry I work for, unfortunately, I will have to inform my future employer of every place I worked for, so if I skip it in my resume, I will still have to inform my future employer about working here during a background check.

I have no idea btw. what flair to use, maybe that's even a wrong sub to talk about it, but I talked a bit about leaving a job, so I am thinking - this might be the flair and this might be a place üòÖ"

The working hours are great for a work-life balance with my young family (10am-6pm Monday to Friday). Our company is basically a 24-hour, seven-day operation, so I have worked nights, evenings, weekends a lot in the past. I've been WFH since March 2020.

Out of the blue yesterday I got a call from one of our main bosses offering me a decent pay rise for a job that will, more than likely, throw me back into working 2-10pm, 3-11pm and some weekends. I was honest and said that I appreciated the offer of more money, ut due to my home life, it wasn't all that attractive at this stage.

They got a bit snarky with me and said if I wanted to remain in my current position, I'd have to commute to an office that's two hours away after the Covid waves passes, which I thought was in bad taste. They said my contract states that they're able to change my hours. If I HAVE to take this new position, I want guarantees on my hours and days off, which they say they're unable to do right now.

1200,Is this a red flag?,jobs,"About 2 weeks ago, I got a call from one of the companies I've applied to.

A day or two later they sent me a text that says \[enter generic 'we're sorry' text here\].

And two days ago, about a week from that refusal, they called me again and asked if I'd be willing to breach the contract with my current workplace and start working for them from Feb 1st because they liked my skillset; and that they're also willing to negotiate to pay me 2k/y more than my last workplace. I said I'd rather not unless they can give me an absolutely solid job offer. In the end, I agreed to show up for an in-person interview tomorrow because I thought 'why not' but I wonder if this could be a red flag because 1. They said 'no' at first, and 2. Now they are willing to re-negotiate. What do you think?

TL;DR: Company said they don't want me at first, but a week later they called me up and said they'd like to process with a further interview process and also want me to start working in 2 weeks (which makes me break my freelance contract)."

Life is a trip, no pun intended, because the apps that I used to get me here I've been deactivated from during the holiday season.

I have a car too that I rent but it's giving me a lot of problems and stress. I want to return it but I'm afraid that may come with more problems because it needs some fixing.

Preferably I would want to do driving gigs with same day payouts or work-from-home gigs that provide the same thing but what would you suggest how I should go about this?

I have experience working from home for about a year but pretty much did the virtual call center setting thing in my house at the time.

I have driving experience and could provide an abstract.

I am tech savvy, proficient in macOS and Windows although vaguely familiar with the Linux ecosystem.

I do not mind doing manual labor as well. Some of those Instacart and Shipt orders felt like manual labor anyway.

Someone please help. I am not a beggar. I am not afraid to work and I am not a dumb individual. I've busted my ass all last year trying to get back on track in life after having the rug pulled from under me by my ex and fake people I was associated with.

90% of the jobs posted by Indian recruiters are fake. When you apply for the job they don't respond to the job applied. Instead,  they start sending other irrelevant jobs and request for an updated resume. What the hell is this practice? What type of resume farming operations are these? They already have the latest resume.

Further, I love to work on 1099/C2C contracts but Indian body shops have taken over the entire contract market.  They pay peanuts on W2 hourly while charging $120+/ hr  to the clients.  Indians have Monopoly in every company's IT department and they give these contracts to their own indian body shops.

Enough rant. Upvote it if you agree."
1213,Weird interview timing?,jobs,"So I applied to a job a few months ago. Got an interview but didn‚Äôt get selected. They told me I was a strong applicant and they would keep my cv on file for future opportunities.

Same company posted another job that is basically the same but at a different location a few months later.

I applied for that one as well and simply stated in my cover letter that I had interviewed for the other position and they said they would keep my application on file so wanted to let them know I was still interested.

Also sent them a quick message directly as I had their email from the first interview basically saying the same thing.

I first got an automated message after a while saying I hadn‚Äôt gotten it. The expected start date has already passed now as well.

Today I got a surprise invitation to interview. In person. TODAY! 

I said it was short notice and I was at work so couldn‚Äôt just leave for an interview today.

This seems weird. They already know me and what I can bring as they interviewed me for an identical position before. And the expected start date has already passed. And i was super short notice.

Back when I started in this field I only had one client and a 6 hour work week now i have more and a 60 hour work week. I have started to get physical pain from my job as my ankles have been killing me to where I need compression socks. I stopped looking forward to work due to the other adults involved in these cases that I just am full of anxiety every time I go to a shift. Also when it comes to the office, they constantly have me signing paperwork that we never discussed about in advanced and expect me to extra things from that paperwork, with no option to say no to the stuff they have us sign. My supervisor also has given me multiple panic attacks and is one of the main reasons I want to give up, she even has put me in awkward situations and lowered the value of my contributions to the company while supervising me at one shift recently. I could switch to where I won‚Äôt work with her but I just keep thinking I am bad at my field and my supervisor is one of the things that keeps making me think it. 
I know I am not perfect and sometimes I want to go the extra mile somewhere I shouldn‚Äôt but even then it‚Äôs like only rare that I let things like that continue. Sometimes my job is consisted of doing nothing while watching everything and others get into something, it‚Äôs not great anymore.

I thought I had a good salary for my current position: 110 000 a year as a software product owner. I recently received a job offer for a similar position, same industry which is 2-3 times higher.

I love my current job: the team, the project, even the relationship with the boss. So 1) I am wondering if I am way underpaid in my current position (or is the job offer crazy good ?), and 2) I am hoping to use this job offer to negotiate a raise in my current position. Any advice ?

The tdsb janitors start at $20.80/hr

After 6 months I would make $22/hr

Full time goes up to $25/hr

It‚Äôs unionized

The superintendent job is a salary of 50k split between my boyfriend ( so 25k salary each yearly)
And it‚Äôs live in. 

FREE rent in Toronto. 
Commission based income opportunities. Free parking spot. Nearby all necessities. That‚Äôs really hard to find here. I don‚Äôt know what the hours are gonna be like so I‚Äôm very unsure if I should take the opportunity. But I REALLLLY want to have my own apartment!

So it‚Äôs either take the tdsb job, do the work and live with his nagging parents or go do the superintendent job and move out by next month‚Ä¶ which is gonna be an awkward scenario if I do take the position.

I knew 2 weeks in, I just KNEW . But I gave it some time. The training was a disaster, and now that I‚Äôm ‚Äúfully trained‚Äù I‚Äôm working 12 hr days (salaried!!) . I am a supervisor but I have such little adequate training I cannot help my team. And I can‚Äôt even do the typical supervisor duties as I am busy trying to get my team out of the weeds as they also are working until 10pm! I have never witnessed such a toxic culture. Newbies leave in droves , and I can see why. Zero training, zero support system. All in all, it‚Äôs been an absolute strain on my mental health. 

But it has a few pros . Very few. 59k salary with a 6% bonus (to me this is very good , (Midwest for ref and no degree). They are very lax on time, too lax people never show up. But I do like flexibility and not being watched like a hawk that I log in 8am on the dot. There is absolute no way I could lose my job, this place is utter chaos (which they admit) they know the problem. But they pay entry level embarrassing low, and train like hell. So it‚Äôs a never ending cycle that I don‚Äôt see changing. 

The job I may get an offer for, I had an offer back when I took this job. It was 45k hourly though so possible ot, and a bonus I forget the percentage . I was able to see benefits in the offer letter and they are just as good as current company. The recruiter loves me and we have been in contact since dec , as there wasn‚Äôt openings until Jan. I just am so fearful, what if it‚Äôs worse. Is that possible. That is what scares me, because I never knew a job could be this bad until I started my current role. I don‚Äôt even understand how upper management got into their positions. And not in the boy club type way. I mean legit my boss told me to just clear out our teams emails that were over a week old. That was a legit ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to clean up the emails, by acting like they never existed . 

I say all this because the recruiter reached back out today, and I do not want to turn down a second offer that just looks bad.

I didn't get a PhD to support operations and customers. I know why I'm being sent to a customer site to troubleshoot: because even the field service guy with 20 years experience can't figure it out. And I know why I'm being pulled into operations, because this is a new tool config and there's literally three guys in the entire company capable of doing the work, we all have PhDs, and one is a manager. So it falls to me. But I just don't want to do it. I haven't done a single bit of *interesting* work since November. My recent days are filled with meetings with 30-60 minutes break in between, which is not a long enough to focus on anything. I am so wiped out. On the days I work from home (possible because I'm just in meetings all day so what's the point of being in the lab?), after the first few meetings I am totally meeting-fatigued and I start playing pokemon and only half listening. It makes it bearable. Yes, I got a PhD so that I could play pokemon in an attempt to make my day bearable.

I struggled for so long, had so much passion, and chose to be totally poor through my whole 20s for this? I want to quit and take a huge salary cut to work at a national lab or NRL or NIST or something, but I cannot because I am stuck where I am for eighteen more months for non-job reasons. I was initially ecstatic to get this job because it meant I was able to do high-paid technical work while I was stuck here for three years longer than I wanted. And then three years became six. I can't do it. I am done. I made it 4.5 years of the 6 and what?

Now I'm pigeonholed and there is no way I can transition in my late 30s to a totally different field, the one I actually want. I mean I could, but it would mean doing a postdoc for two years? Or maybe, just maybe, I find a company willing to take a chance, but also take a salary cut because my skill level, in their product line/field, is the same as a 27 year old.

It would be one thing if I could relax, just do my job, and enjoy other stuff like hobbies or travel. But my job is incredibly stressful. I have no free time. Required to work crazy hours. Customer calls to China from 9-10 PM. Weekend work to get process runs through. Several week+ trips to customer sites that totally interrupt my life. I often get home incredibly late."

However, I don‚Äôt have the time to schedule the next phases because I now have an offer from the another company. The best delay I can manage is perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday next week. 
Therefore; how can I ask the recruiter if she can speed up the interview process? This company is my #1 choice. I feel that I am a strong candidate but also don‚Äôt want to come off pushy. I know I‚Äôm not giving them too much time either. I was hoping to send an email tomorrow on Thursday."

The job is great for robots, someone that doesn't want to learn, and do the same task 1,000 times. But even if that is the case, I find I rarely ever have 8 full hours of work. Today, I spent about 3-4 hours, just  ""looking busy."" People that say this is amazing truly don't know how mentally taxing this can be. Doing nothing can be exhausting.

I‚Äôd be freelance/consultant at the new position.

I accepted the position only because the pay increase is huge for me and the title change. I‚Äôm leaving my ‚Äúsafe‚Äù job because I‚Äôve been there for 3 years and in that time haven‚Äôt received a raise and honestly I‚Äôm looking for a challenge. Also virtually zero growth in this place.

I‚Äôm 29, healthy and looking to take a step up in my career. Both positions are WFH for the foreseeable future and with this new temp position, i‚Äôm exploring S corps for filing my taxes.

1250,I Finally Did It!,jobs,"I just accepted my job offer on Tuesday as a Human Resources Assistant Administrator with a multi-state healthcare organization. I am so relieved that I finally got my foot in the door for a career path I have always wanted.

For over a year now, I have been job searching and applying to over 50 job applications on most days, not just in my state, but all over the country, work from home and/or in office. I was constantly receiving rejections over and over for my applications. The beginning of this year, I started to give up since I was having no success, but I gave it one last try. I spent one evening and night applying to numerous open positions. I got a call last week for a phone interview, then a Zoom interview 2 days later, an in person interview on Monday and the offer on Tuesday. It was a big sign of relief.

I do not have a college degree, but I have experience from owning two, very small, business, working as a full time lead in a big box store, working as a store manager at a cellular store, and working as a customer service advocate for a health insurance company. The no college degree was definitely not helping. I come from an area that is well below the national average poverty rate and from a family that does not have to financial means to pay for a college degree for 3 children. Any financial assistance did not come from my parents when I went to school for 2 semesters before I had to drop out for medical complications.

Back to the new job. The minimum job requirements, on the job posting, requires a bachelors degree in business administration or similar along with 3-5 years minimum of experience. I still applied to this position, despite not having a college degree. This is the first employer that actually looked at my real world experience rather than seeing that I have a paper from a school that says I can do it (no offense to those that do have a college degree).

Now, it is grind time. I have my foot in the door and finally have the opportunity to put my skills and experience together as a whole. My goal is to eventually work my way up to a Director of Human Resources or an Executive Director of Human Resources. With this, quite large, bump in pay, I will finally be able to attend school without the financial stress I had before. I know there will be a lot of learning along the way, but that is how you become successful.

So basically, don‚Äôt give up. There is and always will be an opportunity for you to shine! It might not be today or tomorrow (in my case, over a year later), but you will eventually make it. Believe in yourself find something that you are passionate about. If your are passionate about the job role you are applying for, it will show if and when you have your interview(s). If you are someone like me, that doesn‚Äôt have a college degree, try to accrue as much diverse experience as you can, that way, in lieu of a college degree, you are able to put it all together to meet the experience in total for the job type you are passionate about. You might not get the exact position you want, or the exact company you want, at first, but, it gets your foot in the door for better opportunities.

Again, DON‚ÄôT GIVE UP!!! You‚Äôve got this! It might be tough now, but it WILL pay off in the future!


btw, I‚Äôm not really sure which flair to use, so please forgive me if the one I used does not really match"

I have some relatable experience, but my background and job title differs slightly so I am going up against candidates that have direct experience within these types of roles.

With that being said, I have had about 30 interviews within the last year and have made it to the last round every time, but I do not get the job. I feel like I must be doing something right to make it so far, but at the same time I can't knock that last interview out of the park enough to land the job. I was concerned it may be a personality thing, but every single person I interview with always comments on what a great personality I have. I am not sure if they are just being polite to make the let down easier, but I am growing so frustrated and my confidence is knocked.

I really hope that I can land an interview or referral or something next week. What should I do to maximize the chance that I can work there? Sorry but this is my first time applying for a big big job."

1257,i need some improvement advice.,jobs,"today, i got fired for the first time in my life at pita pit. first they started by taking me off of the schedule leaving me asking my manager if i was working this weekend (because i work only weekends) with her responding
 ‚ÄúYa sorry I didn‚Äôt reply last night. Because we‚Äôre closing early this weekend I had to cut a lot of peoples hours. ‚Äú 
which was complete BS, because i go on for a couple more weeks asking again why i wasn‚Äôt working, she finally answered 3 days later with 
‚ÄúHey, do you want to come in tomorrow to talk to me. Anywhere around 3-4 would be great.‚Äù
so i go in.
she ended up telling me i was fired for being on my phone (without warning me at all for anything i did wrong) and not listening when told.
I never thought i was a good worker but at this job i constantly had to ask people what to do, since i was only working weekends i only got trained to use the grill and to do register, i usually would only do register because they didn‚Äôt teach me what went into the pitas they just told me what to throw down but when there was someone to grill i would let them do it. it was super slow and when i could i would use my phone since the girls would go in the back room and play on tiktok during the empty times. for me i would either go with them or stand by the register like some would do. 
Even once i took out 3 weeks old of trash by myself because i was NEW. they had me as their butch. i asked if people needed help and would take initative but if someone told me not to do something i wouldn‚Äôt. i feel like such a disappointment."

My step-aunt recently got a job delivering food to patients at a medical center right down the street from me. Said she applied, got a call 2 days later, and they did a phone interview and hired her on the spot. Then she said I should apply and we could work together. 

So I did. I applied on New Year's Eve and sent my aunt a text telling her I'd done so. She said she'd let her supervisor know, which she did and that I'd probably hear back pretty quickly as she had.   


Nothing. I texted my aunt a few days later and she mentioned that she'd talk to her supervisor when she went in for her shift. Later that night, she came by to visit and told me they had ""assigned me to a recruiter and I should be expecting a call within a day or 2.""

This happened on Jan 5th and as of today, I still haven't heard anything. I didn't just rely on that job though and have been applying to others while hopefully waiting for the call, but I don't get it.

1267,What am I doing wrong,jobs,"Hey guys,

 I wanted to ask what I am doing wrong in my job search?

 I have been job searching for close to 8 months now with little to no success in even getting an interview. I have applied to entry level jobs, jobs I have 10+ years experience in and a few jobs I have no business even applying for just to see if I could get engagement. Initially my goal was to start a career in IT, but that quickly turned into any job I can get. 

I am halfway done my CompTIA A+ cert. Meaning I have about half the coursework done, and passed my 'practice tests' for the first part.  I'm hoping that is the big secret to at least getting an interview in IT. I would like to point out that is my goal in the end, to get into IT and work into Networking or Cyber Security. But as of now it took me 8 months to get turned down for a deli counter position, to have a headhunter fail to find me anything, and I have been ghosted 3 times by potential employers. There is something wrong with me and my appearance to potential employers. I would say 50% of my applications are for IT, the other 50% are for any entry level job I think I can tolerate. I'll chalk the IT fails to me not having the basic certification. I had hoped for at least an interview or two, perhaps an aptitude test, but nothing at all. The other 50% are entry level jobs in all different sectors. 

What should I focus on to improve my odds and what skills do I need to go get validated by a 3rd party to be considered adequate for employment? I have a solid resume, I've had multiple people look at it and help me revise it to the point it's a work of art.  I interview decently, it's likely my weakest ability, but the majority of my concerns are because I don't make it to that point. If I'm failing interview after interview then I'm most likely a giant asshole who needs to work on their personality. But I am not even getting considered for interviews. Most of my skills are in the construction sector, which due to injury is not something I'd like to pursue. But even those few jobs I have applied to in that sector have gone nowhere. 

I do not have a college degree. I went to work for my family construction business, which has since gone under. I can only assume that not having a college degree is why I can't get any interviews? But then why is it considered entry level, or why would that be an issue for something like grocery store or drug store? I ended up applying to these positions out of desperation and I still get turned down? These are skill-less jobs that anyone can do.

So my potential employers, please tell me the best approach to getting an interview currently? Is there something I can do to stick out among the other applications? Is there a certain sector that is hurting really bad and ups my chances of getting in? Any other tips or tricks? 

I realize that the CompTIA A+ is likely what is holding me back from IT jobs. But even if we take what I have experienced and 1/2 it to remove all the IT stuff, it still paints a very bleak picture of what the job market is and how it has been for me. I'm 34 years old, deli counter isn't what I dreamed of but sometimes you have to do what you have to do... and I can't even get that? Something is off and I need help figuring it out. 

Oh and I have a clean record, and a clean driving record, and don't do drugs and have never failed a drug test. So the idea that my 'extra curricular activities' holding me back isn't valid either."

I have been applying to jobs in my field, and there is a good economy for my field in the city I‚Äôm
living in. I am very qualified and have many valuable skills. I have a couple interviews scheduled, but not as many as I‚Äôd like. 

Currently, I don‚Äôt have a job in my field. I interviewed with one company that wants to hire me, but they need approval for 2022 hiring from their larger corporate structure. To make some extra cash during my undergrad, I got a job as a waitress, but everyone‚Äôs hours at the restaurant have been reduced because COVID numbers are extremely high where I live. As a result, I am making almost no money, and I have bills to pay. I can‚Äôt get another retail/serving job because they‚Äôre not hiring due to COVID.

Turnover is insane now, but it hasn‚Äôt always been this way. This company used to be very reasonable and was enjoyable most days. 

I‚Äôm intelligent, I‚Äôm efficient, and I do a good job. I am enrolled in college with no debt, pursuing my 2-year and afterwards I will shoot for my 4-year.

1286,Asking for a Raise When a Project Keeps Getting Pushed Back,jobs,"Hey all. I'm looking for some perspective on my situation. TIA!

Last year I was promoted within my company to work on our new platform. Our company has two older platforms that our clients use and the intention is to -eventually- move them to mine.

Right now, I am the only person working in my particular department/in my role on this new platform and it's an unspoken understanding that I hardly do any work all day between medium sized projects. This would be fine and ideal if I didn't need more money to live.

There was a large project that was going to be launched in November 2021 where we were meant to onboard a new client but this project got pushed to May 2022 and may be pushed back further still. If we launched this project successfully, I could make a strong argument about the value I bring to the company and advocate for a promotion. At our end of year check in my supervisor indicated we could work toward a title change (no timeline mentioned) and didn't mention any areas I could improve.

Ultimately, I think I'm out of luck until the large project launches. I know the common advice is to change jobs to get the compensation you want but I would need to experience of launching this project to put on my resume if I were to have any luck elsewhere. I believe I am capable but I don't have the exposure and experience I need at this company to get a promotion here or somewhere else. I don't think I can argue about my future value without tangible results for my boss to present to his boss. We're in a big corporation so decisions have to go up a chain just like the project delay has nothing to do with my department.

Would it be out of line to ask for a raise in my current role with my year anniversary coming up? Would it be out of bounds to argue for a promotion a few months from now but before the project is launched? Or, ultimately, do I need to sit tight/pick up side work until after the project is launched?"

I'd like to get something in the range of $14-15/hr, of course I would prefer at least 15, I doubt I'll get it. But honestly even if they offer anymore than what I make now and can work with my college schedule well, I'll take it.

I am okay with resolving client issues however I dont like the pressure when it comes to generating sales. The delimma comes in because I am 21 and I live alone so I have no one that can back me up if I end up jobless and I have school trying to finish my degree still in 2nd year of college. I love my job because it gives me weekend days off and the schedule is not shifting, the pay is pretty good as well and the complex issues are challenging, so I will loose these benefits if I decide not to continue with the company on top of not having a salary for a few weeks or a couple of months and compromising my school due to schedule. so not really sure if I just wait it out see until when I will last until they decide to terminate me or to just proactively resign risking so much especially time (school) and money (bills etc) just to prioritize my well being coz sales makes me anxious.

1295,Should I take the job? Designer here,jobs,"**Here is a little bit of context:**

I am a graphic-turned UX/Product designer. Have been doing graphic design for a little over 5 years until a year ago when I decided to transition into UX/Product. I enrolled in a couple of courses/Bootcamp to obtain my certificate in User Experience design. During that period of time, I volunteered at a non-profit organization as their UX Designer (none of their products have been shipped yet, they are in the funding process). I did learn a bit during this period of time but what I really wanted was to work for a for-profit company that focuses on SaaS mobile &amp; web platforms because that is where my long-term goal lies.

Thing is, where I am from, majority of the job postings you see require at least 2-5 years of experience. in UX, which I do not have. What I do have is the upper hand when it comes to UI/visual design process because I come from a GD background. Honestly, I think that is partially the reason why I have been getting interviews because there is no way a company would hire a designer based on less than a year of experience in UX/Product unless it was a junior/intern position. And coming from 5 years of GD, I do NOT want to start over with a ""junior"" title.

My portfolio is just good at best because I do only have one project to show for (a capstone project I did during my Bootcamp). Not going to lie though, my website is quite interactive and I do have the visuals/aesthetics nailed down. My one capstone project is also quite in-depth and goes through the entire UX process. So that is probably why I have done over 10+ interviews for a UX/Product position..

Now that y'all have a bit of context where I am coming from, I am stuck on whether I should accept this job offer or not. They are a for-profit company that focuses on Saas mobile/web platforms. It would only be a contract gig (until the end of March) but the pay is pretty good. They did say there is a possibility of extending after the contract ends. And it is definitely the most I have ever made in my career. It's just I'm not entirely passionate about lawyers (it's an app that helps lawyers communicate/interact with their clients safely). **Also, my friend (who is also a UX/product designer) indicated some red flags throughout the interview process..**

1. They asked me to review the UI and give them tips on how to enhance the user experience. I wouldn't necessarily say this was a take-home assignment. it was very casual and I completed it by sending them a brief email, literally only took about 15 minutes. The only red flag here is, they asked me to perform the study based on THEIR OWN company user interface. Wouldn't this be considered a big NO within the industry?
2. The CEO texted me at night during dinner time asking me to check my email (it was the job offer email) - This was a little bit strange to me haha
3. I would be the only UX/Product designer within the company
4. I did the interview on Friday and got the job offer on Tuesday (seems a little quick?) - They also had 50+ applicants (I saw on their LinkedIn job posting)

I mean, I am waiting to hear back from 2 other companies that will likely have a higher pay/not on contract but I am not entirely certain I will get either of them. I mean, the interview went great but I don't want to risk losing all 3 jobs?

So now that y'all have a bit more context, should I take the job? I would casually also be job hunting on the side because if they don't end up continuing my contract, I'll be jobless again by end of march. Some people are saying take it but others are saying don't. I am stuck. Are the red flags really red flags?

What do you fellow UXers think?

I filled out an availability sheet as soon as I knew what hours/days I would be working my new job, and even gave them two weeks to put out a new schedule before I started this new job. The days I am working my other job are Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays. Everything has been fine until this past week. Golf course scheduled me for a Monday closing shift. I figured it was an honest mistake and my boss just forgot. I shot her a text just basically saying ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm not supposed to work this day I‚Äôm still doing Mondays at my new job‚Äù not exactly that and more professional/compassionate. Well, she decided to not bother answering my text message. I didn‚Äôt go in on Monday and thought all was well. She sent out the new schedule about 30 minutes ago for the rest of the month. Apparently, she decided to not only cut my hours to ONE DAY A WEEK, but the one day that she chose to schedule me? Mondays! I‚Äôm too frustrated to text her right now and figure out what‚Äôs going on. This hasn‚Äôt been an issue for the past two (almost three) months, and all of a sudden it‚Äôs a major issue. I love my job at the golf course, everything about it! And usually my manager is really awesome and keeping in line with everyone‚Äôs availability, which is why I‚Äôm so confused. If anyone has any advice on what to say, I‚Äôd love to hear it. If not, thanks for reading my rant, lol."

1299,A family member thinks I could be having trouble finding a job because of racism. Could this be true?,jobs,"So, my family moved to a more rural area of the country (where we lived before was very diverse) and I have been having difficulty finding a job even when I have loads of related experience. I've tried working on my resume and the other usual tips. My mother told me that she thinks a possible reason for me having trouble finding a job is that there is (according to her) lots of racism here. My family is Italian/Greek and most have lighter hair and skin tone, but my father and I have dark hair, skin, and eyes. My father claims to have dealt with the same thing because of our last name and how he looks. This sounded ridiculous to me, but people have thought before that I am not white or that I am middle eastern.

My mother thinks I will have better luck applying and getting through interviews if I change my last name on my resume to something more white and she has also dropped hints that I should change how I look (hairstyle, shave beard, etc.). The only evidence that really backs this up is that I used to have no problem finding a job, but here it has already been a while without one.

I'm going to keep on working on other more likely factors, but is this something I should actually consider? I know I sound incredibly ignorant but I'm honestly wondering if employers are really discriminating against a person based on assumptions about their last name and skin tone."

I have been searching and learning remote job postings online and found out it will not be an easy switch based on my background. Most remote jobs require programming skills, IT background.

I‚Äôm told it is a company culture thing, but I think it‚Äôs great tactic on their part to save money.  Recently I have been contacted by past managers (2 different companies) asking that I consider coming back to work for them.  The pay being offered is more than I am making now, the work is interesting and the coworkers are good.  The only draw back is neither of them will commit to letting me work from home full time which my current employer does allow.  

I do like my current job.  My manager brought up promotion on 3 different occasions in the last 2 years.  She said she would talk to her manager about it, but nothing has come of it. 

Is it advisable to use these other offers (yes they are solid offers) to negotiate a promotion or at least a better raise?  And if yes, how does one go about this? I‚Äôm not sure what I would say to her exactly. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm threatening to leave."

1322,Job Seeking Advice (Context to Follow) - Looking for experience with this particular situation,jobs,"Here‚Äôs my situation: I have worked in a financial administration position for three years. In my department, most of my team‚Äîsix of eight‚Äîis looking for employment elsewhere because of our perception of the leadership within the department (e.g. culture issues, promised rewards that do not come to fruition, inadequate pay relative to our performance, etc.). 

One of my colleagues may accept a position in the next week or two, and, if this colleague leaves, my job becomes intolerable. I am expecting to receive two job offers in different departments with my current employer, but I realize this employer is a toxic institution and I would like to leave asap. While I have a very strong resume, I seem to only be able get interviews from my current employer. Due to my concerns of my colleague putting in four weeks in the next few weeks and the impact of his departure on my job, I am considering accepting one of these two positions, even though both will likely offer less pay, because I cannot hear the thought of being here open-ended once my colleague leaves. 

Thus, I am inquiring about experiences/advice/current thought process/new school thoughts around accepting a position elsewhere at my current employer to get out of my current department, and then continuing to apply to other jobs that I actually want. Normally, I would never consider such action, as i have always remained in a position for at least 18 months before looking elsewhere, but this situation is different. 


What‚Äôs your advice? Ideally, I would accept one of these positions, continue to look, and hopefully be gone within 3 months after landing a job that I really want‚Ä¶ in reality, prhaps it‚Äôs shorter than 3 months, perhaps longer. But I realize doing so is sort of a fucked up thing to do to the hiring manager and potentially have consequences should I ever pursue employment again at this company (which I likely won‚Äôt). I don‚Äôt fee lik I owe my employer anything after being screwed over by their impute equity values that limit my pay scale in terms of salary, among other things. 

Is it a bad idea? I really don‚Äôt think I can stay should my colleague leave and I‚Äôll want to jump ship ASAP. However, I think there will be better external opportunities for me over the next six months, but I can‚Äôt wait to get out so I‚Äôm inclined to accept one of these other jobs and then Continue looking even if that means resigning from the new job within the first six months. 

As a final note, if I accept one of these job offers, whether I resign from it 3 weeks later or six months later, I would tel the hiring manager that someone offered me a job that I couldn‚Äôt refuse since I would only leave for a position that I really want (and could potentially say I know I don‚Äôt like working in this field whereas this other field is my dream job)."

I work in a small team of 4 and recently I'm starting to feel like the 3 of them are forming a clique. A part of our work is to get client feedback and it's not so easy to gather as most clients tend to not offer feedback. However one client did for one of the workers and our manager honed in on this to nominate the team for their work. The feedback was mainly about the support of one worker though. Anyway the nomination was shortlisted for an award. Our manager insisted that the 3 workers attend and not myself. I was not sure why but I was ok with it. However I found recently that one of the admin team workers nominated 2 of the workers yet she has no clue what we do as she isn't involved with our work. They have been shortlisted for two awards. I'm starting to overthink this but I feel it's becoming a bit political and I'll tell you why...

We all do the same work. The other 3 are more extroverted, chatty, loud when in the office. They are the only ones like this. I'm the opposite and consider myself introverted and tend to keep my head down and work. I'm starting to think these awards aren't given on merit really but more about likeability amongst workers. I now feel ostracized and don't feel comfortable working with my team. I'm just curious if others have shared similar experiences or if not am I being paranoid?"

1338,Has this ever happened to anyone? What does this mean and what do I do?,jobs,"I am putting this on a throwaway just in case. 

I am really bothered by some feedback I just got from my boss and I have no idea what to do about it.

Backstory - I‚Äôve been with a large company for 4 years in multiple departments. I love the company. I received an internal promotion about 1.5 years ago in the midst of work from home (we still are). It‚Äôs a small team of 4 people. Combined, they have over 150 years of experience at the company in the role. 

The work is variable and usually heavy at the end of the business quarter. There‚Äôs not really assigned tasks, the work is due at a certain due date and how you get there is up to the individual. I assumed when I took the job there would be some troubles with the tenure of the team members because that‚Äôs just how it goes. 

What happened - So it‚Äôs the busy time. As I stated, due dates and work is heavy at the end of the quarter. The job is rather unique and difficult, so training was intensive and this was the first quarter I was let to do all the work on my own.

I saw this as a great opportunity to prove to the team I have listened and learned carefully. I wanted to earn their respect and show proficiency.  So I have busted my hump the past 3 days often working late to complete 35% of my quarterly workload already.

All the work was verified as correct and not the least bit sloppy. I was very excited because I could feel my confidence growing. We had a team meeting today where we share what we‚Äôre working on. My boss even said, ‚ÄúWOW, awesome job getting that done ALREADY‚Äù. All other tenured members of the team hadn‚Äôt completed anything. 

All good, right? Well, no. My boss calls me this afternoon and I could tell there was an impending coaching. I‚Äôm sure you all know the feeling. The awkward small talk when they know you know this is something deeper.

She essentially tells me there is concern from the team that I‚Äôm working too fast and not asking enough questions. I‚Äôm floored. I don‚Äôt know what to say. I could hear in her voice that she didn‚Äôt want to be having this conversation and was almost embarrassed by it. I merely reply the work is correct and I don‚Äôt have any questions - I‚Äôve been trained for a year and a half. 

She then responds, ‚Äúwell, even if you don‚Äôt have questions, maybe talk to the team and reiterate what you do know so they can build trust in you‚Äù.

Essentially I was coached for working swiftly, efficiently, and independently. I thought I was proving to the team my abilities and commitment to the role. Guess not. 

What should I do? What does this mean? Am I in the wrong? What can I possibly do differently?"

I am a recent college graduate and had recently gotten an internship at a radio station.. and I am extremely excited because this is the first step towards my career in broadcast media/journalism. The thing is, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs paid, so I would possibly have to keep working at my current retail job‚Ä¶where the schedule isn‚Äôt that flexible at all. We are extremely short-staffed, with people taking off because of vacations and workers calling out sick. 
The internship would be from 9-4pm Mondays &amp; Wednesdays (and on Fridays from 9-3pm) I currently work Monday thru Wednesday (with Thursdays off) and Friday and Saturday (Sundays off) all from 4:30-9:30pm.
I currently live with my parents, and they are concerned about the possible 12-13 hour days that I would have to be pulling off, as they think it would exhaust and possibly burn me out. My mental health isn‚Äôt the greatest, (depression, anxiety, I‚Äôm also on the autism spectrum, not a mental illness, but something of note) so I am worried about me becoming burnt out as well, but I have student loans that I have to pay back starting in May, and I am currently saving up to buy myself a car.. does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? Should I quit or try to work it out? Thank you!"
1342,Interview Thoughts?,jobs,"TLDR: had an interview with hiring managers (no other interviews as this was the final). Hiring manager asked about start date, advised will ask for reference next week, told me the salary range and what my expectations were with respect to the compensation. I did not give them a figure rather indicated I'll consider the top of the range. Can I negotiate when(if) an offer is presented?

I had an interview for a position at a Canadian crown corporation.

The interview was with a panel of 2 managers. The interview went well as far as I think as they were really engaging and gave positive feedback when I answered their questions. 

The hiring manager asked when I could start, what my salary expectation are? (Hiring manager had shared the salary range for the position during our initial phone discussion (50-65k) I responded by saying given the responsibilities and my experience I am expecting towards the higher end of the range. Prior to this the hiring manager did mention in their email, that new employees start at the mid or just below mid point. 

My question is can I still negotiate if they formally put an offer?

I would have to relocate to their office location as it is in the Greater Toronto Area about 2 - 2.5 hrs north of Toronto

Secondly they said they would be getting in touch next week (week Jan 10-14) with all candidates irrespective if they are selected or not. 

During the discussion the hiring manager also asked me if I would be interested in other location within GTA as she is responsible for a few locations.

I sent each manager an individual thank you note and one of them replied the next day saying it was their pleasure talking to me.

Do any of those point towards a potential offer?

Thanks.."

Even as I have been doing relatively well, I'm not going to have much to live off of when I get home as the average wage in this country is about $300/mo.  


So that means I will also have to find a job to get by almost immediately after I arrive. I only have a BA in Education (History) and, like many teachers, I've burned myself out of classroom work. My age is a concern for me as it seems too late to start from the beginning again and also the inherent ageism in the hiring process.  


So I'm asking you, Reddit, what suggestions would you have for me in transitioning into a different field? What areas would fit well with the kinds of skillsets I would have honed doing this kind of work for 14 years?"

So I've managed to land an offer which I'll most likely get the contract by next week. It's a good raise and have what I want. However, I'm still getting more interviews and some of these have a lot better remuneration, better perks and in a new industry that I wanted to go for. 

It's great I also have bargaining power from already having an offer, but what if I end up landing the other roles that are a lot better than the first one? I'm guessing if I decide to back out of the offer or the contract after signing it  - it would blacklist me from that company and sour things up? 

Any advise on navigating this would be much appreciated.

I am a licensed real estate agent and work as a full time staff member at my brokerage. I‚Äôve been here a a few months. Shortly before I was hired, I had an interview for the same position at another brokerage that would have paid me $20k more a year in salary. That $20k would have made a huge difference for me because right now my salary is around $34k with bonuses. My salary is nowhere near enough to qualify for a decent apartment in the city. I basically had to take this job because I made zero commissions after 8 months of working only as an agent. Luckily, my job gave me the option to work temporarily remote so I am currently splitting rent with a family member outside the city. I am also participating in a program that will allow me to buy a house with no down payment and the mortgage would be a little less than the average rent in the city. My plan is to close on this home in March since I need to be back in the office by April. 

I love my job and the people I work with. I just don‚Äôt get paid enough for what I do. It is extremely frustrating that my salary is barely enough to afford a crappy apartment. I work a part time job as well but it is more of an ‚Äúon-call‚Äù arrangement. I am also in college and working on getting my NMLS license. I am getting more licenses and education to develop more streams of income for myself.

Recently I interviewed for healthcare positions such as ophthalmic technician, physical therapy aide, medical assistant, and today another medical assistant job. My experience with healthcare began last April in a fast-track nursing assistant program. My instructor was one of those instructors who micromanaged and made me feel worse when I made a mistake at the long-term care, it took me 3 times to pass the class for the skills portion and since I didn't learn things as fast as the other classmates, she almost dropped me during clinicals

I have experienced doubt usually after for all of these positions the aide, assistant, and the technician. when inteviewer took me on tour to meet many staff members it was kind uncomfortable (i didnt know how to act), and not really excited about the opportunities since I wouldn't know how the day-day would feel until I actually start working in the position. I like to help people I know that cause I recently helpd shovel other cars out of the snow next to mine, when I could of just did mine and I ran to help other people push someone elses car out of a snowbank

My current job is a teacher assistant for a headstart/childcare facility and I don't have those doubts being there 2 years (its more i get frustrated and take it personal when the kids become challenging a, I do however enjoy being center of attention during circle time (inattentiveness causes me to come up with creative ways to teach abcs or come up with transitions), but when its free-time its non-stimulating and not want to get down on floor to play with kids, when I began it just felt different and when i interviewed I saw things that excited such as watching the teachers lead the kids. I'm about to give up in terms of career fields, I considered electrician or data center installer, graphic designing (taking classes now), cook (low pay), x-ray tech, working at fredmeyers at cashier taught me I love to talk to people

I began suffering anxiety after being a health and safety professional 8 months which is what I went to school for first, i believe the cause was negative interactions between co-workers,lack of interest of the job, and that job was easy to leave since I experienced that and talked to my dad about how i felt every week, didnt look forward to going to work on monday, doing lots of data entry and any office oriented task especially if I was on night shift I would easily get carried away and get on my phone or google things for career searching."

Even taking problems to HR and resulting in nothing.  I‚Äôm not confident that even after sticking it out a month I would feel any differenent. I don‚Äôt know if I should leave after such little time. Or force myself to be here everyday when inside I‚Äôm hating myself for putting myself there. 

I have another job also which is also even more understaffed. I can‚Äôt change my availability there either because of it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Or how to communicate any of this."

This job would pay like $15k more than my current one, so yeah... I really want it! The only thing I'm unsure about in this listing is this:

&gt; Position is 60 to 80% time depending on salary range. 

That's an entire paragraph between the general description of the job and the description of the organization. It's the only mention of ""time"" in the listing. Does anyone know what this means? I tried searching but found nothing.

I don't know if this is relevant to deciphering that sentence, but the job pays on a scale of years of experience. I don't think figuring out the meaning of this is necessary to my application, but I am curious!"
1400,How to Explain Abrupt End to a 1st-time Senior Role on Social Media and CV,jobs,"Hi r/Jobs people. I have a request to handle a job-related thing that requires finesse.

I came to the U.S. last fall along with my spouse who started grad school here and this led me to get promoted to a senior position in the U.S. branch of my company. I'd never worked in a managerial capacity before, but the management entrusted me with this because of my hard work over the last years in my home country (I'd made some really cool things happen with my company). 

I thought things were looking great. 

But only 3 months into my official transition I'm having to leave the country because my spouse wants to divorce me and send me back. How do I explain to my future employer that I have stayed in this managerial position for only 3 months?

I have thankfully been admitted to a grad school program that will start this fall, but there is still an 8 month gap. But my PhD research is closely connected to my company's work, so I don't know how my abrupt departure will reflect on the admission committee who have yet to start the paperwork for me. 

So, I want to handle this transition as professionally as I can (on social media and so on). My abrupt termination may negatively affect the reputation of the company because I don't know how to publicly announce my departure without getting into my situation and my spouse won't want me to talk about family affairs on social media.

Man, I have so many projects to do for our company (We're a small organization and most of my colleagues are foreigners without the necessary skills to complete the projects our company and I myself have been personally promising our patrons and partners to complete this year.)

Has anyone ever gone through something like this before? Any advice and thoughts would be appreciated.

TIA"

I'm a 21 year old hungarian unemployed guy sitting at home with covid, who is therefore unable to leave his house. For reasons I won't discuss here, I need to get 2000 euros until the end of january, or I will be in a very bad situation, both physically and mentally. I'm at the end of my wits, hence this post. What legal ways could I possibly make that amount of money from home? I speak english pretty well, I did 2 years of university studying english linguistics, and have translated stuff before for money. I'm pretty good with computers as well, I had an IT job before, and I'm the go-to guy in my family when it comes to computers and technology. I have access to the internet, and I have a pc, a laptop, and a phone. Other than that, I dont have any real talents, or experiences. Would it be at all possible to collect this amount of money in like 2-3 weeks, without resorting to begging, or illegal things? I would appreciate any advice you could give me, cheers."
1407,Seeking Advice,jobs,"I‚Äôve been in my current job for just over a year. I‚Äôm treated very well and feel well-respected, but I also feel underutilized. I‚Äôve spoken to my manager about this and they have said not to worry. And when I periodically ask around at my smallish company (&lt; 50 employees) to see if I can help out, I‚Äôm often told there is nothing I can help with at the moment. 

In many ways, I enjoy the free time since I use it to learn new skills. But then I also wonder if I‚Äôm doing myself a disservice by not continuing to ‚Äúdo the work‚Äù and continuing to build my on-the-job skills. Because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù I also feel like I don‚Äôt really have a purpose - I feel like I‚Äôm not adding value to the company (or, more abstractly, to society at large). For what it‚Äôs worth, I have about 10 years experience in the workforce.

Here are my questions:

1) If you were in my shoes, would you stay in the current role (treated well, paid well, respected, given autonomy to work from home and train myself) or think about jumping ship to continue building skills on the job and to hopefully rediscover purpose?

2) As noted, I‚Äôve been in this role for just over a year. In my prior role, I was at the company for 1.5 years. (The job before that I was there for over 4 years.) Would 3 jobs in a 2.5-3 year span look bad?"

I couldn't make jokes with her and I tried to break the ice with her but I got nothing. I was in there for less than 10 minutes. She wanted me out.

1414,"Company is changing compensation structure to ""bonus shifts"". Why would a company want to do this?",jobs,"I work in the finance industry. Our compensation structure is usually made of a base salary plus a variable (based on company and individual performance) bonus paid on January. This year, the company has decided to do ""bonus shifts"" in which they take a part of your next year bonus and add it to your base salary (e.g. if you're base salary is 50k and your bonus in 2023 was going to be 10k, they might take 5k from it and make your base salary 55 for 2022 instead). I have never heard of anything like this in the industry and I'm quite curious to understand the reasoning behind it. Why would a company do this? Do they benefit in some way? I suppose for the employer getting the money earlier rather than later is a good thing as long as bonus levels are kept consistent."
1415,I feel like I was bait and switched into a job,jobs,"After a long time of searching, I finally got a new job. I was really excited about the offer and the job, as it‚Äôs in marketing and social media. 

I knew when I applied that there would be a possibility I would work with the activities team, but it would be very rare (once every two months or so). This was made clear in the interview. 

During my first week, my manager decided to train me on some event planning and facilitation, including hosting exercise and classes. I had no issue with it because I knew I would be helping at some point. In my second week, the exercise host got injured during class and I was asked to take over. I agreed because I didn‚Äôt have any tasks for the morning. That day, a resident asked my manager if I would host more often because they liked my energy. My manager said that I would become the host of six exercises a week; she didn‚Äôt consult with me. 

Yesterday, my coworker came back from her injury and wanted to host the class but my manager said it was my responsibility now and my coworker could take over the social media. We were both upset about it because we had applied for the other job, and I told my manager that she said I‚Äôd only help with a few events. I was happy to take on more work but didn‚Äôt feel comfortable having my job changed and I felt like she was dishonest in the interview. I was well aware I‚Äôd be helping, but this was a lot more than expected and I wasn‚Äôt going to be doing the job I applied for. My manager said that she had the right to change anyone‚Äôs duties and I could quit if I didn‚Äôt like it. 

I‚Äôm off today because I tested positive for COVID (asymptomatic) and I am not sure if I should go back."
1416,Is it worth to go through this pre-interview process?,jobs,"I applied to a US company a couple day ago and just got an invitation to start an assesment process that. It is a role as Junior Software Engineer, $60k/year.  
It wound be a big increase from my current salary, since salaries in my country are much lower, and the role is supposedly remote from any timezone.

But this assessment process takes, according to the website itself, about 4 hours and a half to complete. And after that you might get an interview. Just watched a video after logging into their platform where they talk about how they want to find the best 1%.

To me all of this sounds like an incredible waste of time, but I don't know if that's being too picky.   
I feel like they didn't even check my resume and they'll just say I don't fit their requirements after dedicating hours to this.

1417,position i was ghosted from is still posted,jobs,"so background - 

&amp;#x200B;

In August I applied for a communications job with a national nonprofit. Exactly the kind of work I'm hoping to be doing (making a change career-wise!), fully remote and with the pay range I'm looking for. The recruiter - aka the supervisor for this position - responded hours after I applied and I arranged an initial interview the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

The interview went really well - really loved who I talked to! - and the recruiter outlined the next steps. However, the recruiter suddenly went on leave for family reasons and my interview process was handed over to someone else at the organization. I knew my new point person was not expecting my recruiter to go on leave and definitely wasn't prepared to take over this process.

I ended up sending a few follow-up emails and eventually did a communications assignment for my next step. However, after sending a follow-up email two weeks later, I never heard back. This was in September/October.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I was ghosted by someone who wasn't really supposed to be interviewing me, and the position I applied for is still posted. I really hate the concept of chasing someone for a job - I feel like reaching out now is kind of like texting an ex, it just seems desperate - but the position is still posted.

It‚Äôs more of my style and the pay is better. I emailed my boss last night stating that I appreciate the opportunity,  but I‚Äôll be accepting the job offer with another company. He texted me this morning asking what my new job is where I‚Äôll be making more money. Do I need to text him back? I feel like he thinks I‚Äôm lying.

If they outright ‚Äúlet me go‚Äù I‚Äôd get a severance plus be eligible for unemployment. By forcing me to go part time, I think they‚Äôre hoping I‚Äôll quit (so they‚Äôre off the hook) or that it‚Äôs just a stepping stone to firing me so that I can‚Äôt get a severance or unemployment. 

I‚Äôm also assuming I‚Äôll lose all my benefits when the change takes place (healthcare, 401k, maternity leave, vacation days) on top of a major reduction in my salary.

1430,Need advice on possibly leaving new job,jobs,"I just started a new engineering job two months ago and when I took the job it was sold to me as a hybrid work situation but mostly remote. I relocated to the area and live about a 25 minute drive away from the office. Now they want me to go support off site testing about an hour away. They are expecting me to go everyday.

I understand this type of situation happens and I was fine going for a week because I thought it was an extenuating circumstance around the holidays. But now they seem to want me to do this 3 or more times a week. I have a life outside of work and this is really irritating me especially since they didn‚Äôt ask if I was ok with this situation but just told me I am scheduled to go. Especially when I have no expertise with this testing and if anything happens I will need to call someone else. I provide no help being there.

1434,Working so your family/SO doesnt have to,jobs,"This is something Ive thought a lot about. (By family I mean the people you live with).

This is me thinking ahead.

I know that Im going to definitely marry my gf. She's funny, adorable, we barely fight, and she loves me. She doesnt really have any major goals in life regarding a career (although you never know what will happen) and Im fine with that and Ill support any decision she makes. She's content with working at a coffee shop the rest of her life and being happy (with benefits and good pay, for a coffee shop worker). This is nothing against retail/food or other lower paying jobs. If you like and manage well working at one of these, I envy you.

Anyway, I know that, this isnt enough sadly. If we both worked at coffee shops as workers or even shift managers, we would be scraping by for the rest of our lives. We would barely get to go on vacation and we'd constantly be checking our bank accounts when we go out to eat. Retirement would come at 70 years old AT LEAST.

I just know that my gf will eventually get burnt out and start hating it someday (most jobs are like this). The only difference between hating her job and me hating my job, at least Ill be getting paid more. I have a career path that could eventually end up making me over 6 figures.

I think that eventually (maybe when I hit a certain salary), I wouldnt mind her quitting her job (or working significantly less), for her to be happier. Considering I may end up making triple her wage, it almost doesnt seem worth it to me for her to be unhappy doing a job that makes that much less than me.

This isnt something I would tell her because I dont want her to feel bad or even hope that one day she wont have to work (giving false hope). Let me know if you already do this for someone or whether you would ever do this. Again, I dont want to offend anyone, I think all of us have thought about this before in some form.

Generally, I'd like to hit the midpoint of my range. If they go for the lower end of my range, am I in a position to negotiate higher? I don't want to seem rude, ungrateful, or aggressive or anything. And honestly even if it is the low range I'll probably take the position. I just want to have a little wiggle room if possible.

First time transitioning like this, so was just looking for some pointers and input if possible."
1436,Which path would you choose?,jobs,"I was brought into a department as a manager by a c-level executive that has since left the company. I was an internal hire, I had all the qualifications for the role with the added benefit of not needing to be trained but there was still a little bit of resistance to get me approved. My company doesn‚Äôt have many women let alone any people of color at the management level and I‚Äôm not sure if that played a part but it was definitely an observation I easily made. 

My manager left after 2 months of me on the job (she didn‚Äôt like their business practices and professional relationships had gone awry because of lack of trust and transparency - mostly on the business side.)

For the last 4 months (6months on the job now) I have been working my butt off, not only handling my responsibilities but assuming hers as well. I have been the only one in the department and so I was was the only thing keeping the department running. My department needs at least 3-4 people so it‚Äôs been a lot of work and I‚Äôve been hearing nothing but praises. 

I helped hire the new manager who I like and since then I‚Äôve started to hear things from my current interim-manager like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a junior so you have a lot to learn from him it will be great‚Äù, ‚Äúhow old are you‚Äù(to communicate how young I am but mind you there are men with less experience that are my age or younger in more senior positions at this company), ‚Äúwe will make sure to get another hire that you can report to‚Äù which has sounded like I won‚Äôt be reporting to him and they are planning to essentially functionally demote me. I have been improving processes and leading meetings and acting as head of this department for the last few months since I was on my own so I really expected to be the next managers number 2 and help them build the department. Especially since I‚Äôve been going above and beyond with multiple leaders recognizing my work and process improvement initiatives. However it doesn‚Äôt sound like my expectations align with what they are saying.

My previous manager who had hired me said she is now looking for her number two and wants to bring me on at her new company. I would help her build the department which is exactly what I want. I think this is my better option but not 100%. 

Here‚Äôs a summary of the options, what would you choose and why?

Option 1- stay at current job. 
Pro: The new manager is really great and knowledgeable - I want to learn from him. I already get paid pretty well. Lots of room for growth since the company is growing so fast.
Cons: business has some unethical practices that make me pretty uncomfortable. There is a chance I could be functionally demoted.

Option 2- move to new company with previous manager
Pro: I have a good relationship with manager, change for salary bump (20-40%). I would definitely be their number 2.
Cons: manager is more type b personality wise whereas I am type a (prob something I need to figure out how to navigate. New company - grass may not be greener but manager said I would really like it.


I think what I want is a job where I can learn a lot to fast track my path/career advancement."

I'm almost 30 and I've been at my company close to 3 years now, and recently a job has been posted in Florida that my manager says I would have a good shot getting. This job would be more work, but also a significant pay raise(30k min) and a much better resume builder.  I really hate my current day to day and I am getting a new manager who I can see we won't get along, just the way he is metric focused I know the clock is ticking to get a new gig.

I'm having thoughts on applying, but wondering if I could leave family/friends as it's a 3 hour plane ride move for me. 

I'm engaged, but no kids and set to be married in mid 2023. I was thinking if I accepted the job, I could just do it til then and move back home and find another job. I wouldn't be able to move anywhere once I have kids. The Fiance WFH but would want to move back in a year.

I'm not a big fan of change, I see my family once every two months or so, so it would be a big change for me and am unsure if i would regret it.

That isn‚Äôt a huge problem, since I‚Äôm already working, but the longer I‚Äôm at this job past the point when I expected to leave, the more I hate it. My performance is slipping and I‚Äôm going from one of the more productive people on our team to someone who can barely do the bare minimum and sometimes less. It doesn‚Äôt help that this job is remote and I‚Äôm getting really tired of that. 

So does anyone have any advice for staying motivated? I don‚Äôt really want to mess around and be let go because I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do this anymore. I‚Äôm trying to find a way to adjust to the fact that I‚Äôm going to be here longer than I thought and be more productive, but it‚Äôs just such a depressing thought.

I am going to postgraduate as a Masters in Computer Science in a couple of months, so right now I am trying to find my first full time job. I have over 3+ years of professional experience which I gained through part time and contract jobs while I did my studies.

I have applied to a couple of jobs that matches 100% (infact more) with my skills but I still got rejected without even an interview. WHY? I am sure there are resume scanner bots responsible for this because a human review wouldn't do this.

Can you tell me why this might be happening or if you had similar experiences? How can I improve my job search?

1448,Best way to gracefully leave job?,jobs,"Hi all, 

I'm search for some advice on how to gracefully and politely leave my job. 

I've been at this job three years now and I work in a very small team, 2 full time and 2 part time; so it's really just myself and my boss for the most part (within a larger company). I'm ready to move onto another job (no more fulfilment, aiming for higher salary) and want to start applying asap. 

We have a couple of big events coming up in May and July, so I would like to have left way before then to have given my boss and team enough time to prepare for them without me. 

My issue is, I don't want to leave until I get a new job. And so there will most likely be a quick (2 week - 1 month) turn around and I feel that's such a short amount of time given how close I am with my team. 

Now my boss is pretty cool and has, in the past, encouraged me to take opportunities that may come up. So would it be weird to tell her that I am thinking of moving on? Applying for new jobs? 

Thank you so much in advance for your feedback!

1457,Should I accept a position in my dream industry that is far less than what I earn now?,jobs,"Hi everyone!

I own a company in a niche part of an already niche industry. After expenses and subcontractors are paid, I earn anywhere from $100,000-$150,000 on a given year. I love what I do and will always be involved in my company, whether it mean scaling back hours or handing the day to day off to my fianc√© who I've trained.

Through my industry connections I was able to swing an interview for a position in a successful firm in the larger industry of which my niche is part (Let's use an example so I don't dox myself. My company, hypothetically, makes bottle caps for small water bottles, while their company makes bottle caps for all sizes and shapes of bottles).

It is an ""in"" which I've been working towards forever. Their company is expanding and this is the chance to be there at the ground level and grow with them. I was offered $55,000 and was astonished at the low salary. This is an *important* position which will most likely mean I attend meetings with heads of state and travel frequently for conferences. The position also allows for us to work out a commission scheme so for every account I work on, I get a cut. Sure, it means I can grow with the company but I feel I am being extremely undervalued given the visibility and importance of the position.

On the other hand, it's the ""in"" I've been looking for, I have a chance to possibly create my own department, earn commission, and it's in the exact industry in which I intend to work long term. It's an incredible learning opportunity and I will also have my business being run by my fiance to fall back on.

I'm not into the idea of working full-time alongside it, as I'd have no quality of life, but I like the idea of keeping both going. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do:  


1) try to pitch to new job a 4 day working week to give me one day a week to focus on my business? I *haven't had ANYTHING official yet, so it's not like i'm changing terms/conditions of a written agreement*

2) withdraw from job offer, and look for part-time roles only?

1460,I love my job but I‚Äôm starting to notice an unfair task distribution in my team,jobs,"I (25F) work as a recruiter.

I absolutely love my job. I work in a great team (we all get along really well) and most importantly - I‚Äôm allowed to work from home full time. However, lately I‚Äôm starting to notice some things, which are annoying me a bit. 

We are a team of five - 4 recruiters and 1 team lead. Most of the time we don‚Äôt get to decide which open positions we take on, they get assigned to us by managers. However, if we are unhappy about something, it‚Äôs our team lead‚Äôs job to communicate that to the managers.

Lately I started noticing, that most open positions get assigned to me. At one point before the holidays I felt that I couldn‚Äôt take any more work, as it started to become technically impossible for me to concentrate on everything at the same time. I started loosing track on what exactly I have to do.

I had a talk with our team lead and her response was ‚ÄúI get you, but it‚Äôs like that for each one of us, we all have it difficult, we just have too much work‚Äù. 

Well, this week we got introduced to a new type of reporting. Long story short, now we have a joint file, where all the positions are visible for the whole team. I made a short ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù and here‚Äôs what I discovered:

Team lead - 14 open positions (she also does some tasks outside of recruiting)
Colleague 1: 10 open positions 
Colleague 2: 11 open positions 
Colleague 3: 13 open positions 
Me: 29 open positions 

On top of that, everyone except the team lead are each directly responsible for the communication with two hiring managers. I am responsible for communicating with four. 

Here‚Äôs the time to mention that Team lead and colleague 3 get paid at least twice as much as the rest of the team, as they are seniors. Me, colleague 1 and colleague 2 get paid the same. I know that this isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault, but I still think it‚Äôs not exactly fair that I have so many more tasks in comparison to my colleagues.

I‚Äôm now wondering what to do. I feel like lately I‚Äôve been losing motivation and don‚Äôt give my full 100% for the job, which is a pity as I love what I do. 

Am I overreacting? Am I right to feel unfairly treated? What would you advice me to do in this situation? I was thinking about talking to our team lead again, but I don‚Äôt want another ‚Äúwe all have it difficult‚Äù response. 

Any advice would be very appreciated!"

Both roles drew on my skill set, had the same pay,  and I've liked the company so far so I said yes. The 4th interview, and final from what I gather,  was with the manager of that department. All interviews went well, for both roles, and now I have a 5th call set up for today with the COO (who interviewed me a few weeks ago). He said it was just to chat for a few minutes.

I'm trying to think what it could be about so that I can prepare, I always like to have at least two questions but after 4 interviews I can't think of anything to ask or really anything else to say.

I am 35 years old, female, from a southern european country. (where women are not seen as equal with men. need to point this out). I have 10 years experience in Wall Street, in investment banking in ethical hacking. I actually never got a job offer in my home country, but i did manage to get jobs abroad, and even Visas and things, which makes this whole thing even more 'heartbreaking' on on hand (cos of the rejection from my home country). I also have the certificates that go with that, OSCE and CEH.  My first degree is in International Relations and Terrorism. My MSc is Cybersecurity.  I have been applying to jobs in my native country ever since i left (2011) because i wanted to move back. Ive only gotten 2-3 interviews, for junior roles (even though i was already a VP). 

I had an interview for a cybersec role a month ago, and the HR told me 'since your first degree is international relations, we think you would be better off as a secretary in our company'. Though, the rest of the cybersec people working there, are people with no experience There are only a handful people in my home country that have OSCE. And im still being turned down. They prefer men i think. I applied for a pharma company who had a cybersec role, and the guy who 'won' the role is a geology graduate. 

I actually feel quite broken. Ive hidden degrees, ive changed name (just in case they didnt like my name, you never know), they just dont hire me. Im not even getting interviews. I do need to point out that in souther europe, women are seen as baby machines, and companies do prefer men because they dont go on maternity leave.

She was completely fine with it, but recently I applied for a different job which was much more in line with my interests as well as great for getting ready for uni as I am planning on being an art teacher and said job was at my local small business art store, which has craft classes for kids and such. Is it too late to let them know about me leaving and possibly getting a reference? In Canada, employees at said \[massive fast food chain\] get 50% off all meals so I don't want her to think I was just doing it for that, as I haven't been. I also feel bad about leaving after not too long of a time, especially after she helped me so much with being able to accommodate my schedule.

1485,"Restaurant owner/operator looking for a change, advice needed",jobs,"TL:DR
Restaurant owner and manager is burnt out and considering new options. What are good potential careers that earn $200k+ a year for someone with a lot of small business knowledge? BS in small business, econ, and marketing with minors in HR and accounting.

I'm a restaurant owner and operator, effectively GMing 2 restaurants I hold share in. The pandemic was rough on us, but being a quick service drive through concept we have stayed consistently busy. I am getting completely burnt out after 2 years of constant call offs and the craziest turnover anyone has ever seen. My sales have never been higher, and my staffing challenges have never been worse. 

Because every gap on the schedule falls on my plate and I want to keep my team happy and engaged, I'm working around 100 hours a week. It's not outside of my threshold, as it is kind of required when you open a new restaurant, which I've done successfully several times (my 2 stores and several others to help new franchisees). It's starting to become too much while trying to maintain a life and hopefully not fail another SO relationship. 

I've been in restaurants my whole life, about 17 years. Managing ops since 18. I've never had so many problems or felt like throwing in the towel. Until recently, I could manage an operation with minimal intervention, and mostly work 35-50 hours a week in a training role for my management staff after gaining footing and settling staffing. 

I'm very much considering selling at this point and moving into something new. I've tried everything I can think of. I am paying my management staff above and beyond market wages, but they still can't produce results without me. I can't really believe it's a lack of training on my part, as I have always been excessively thorough and available for every aspect of my restaurants, and never had any issues until this current situation. Turnover is killing us, even though are wages are $15 at minimum for a HS kid with no experience,  shift managers are making 40k+, and assistants are around 60k. I've hired and turned GMs but nothing seems to work with out me being very involved. 

Bottom line, I am considering moving and wonder what jobs I may be able to move into that provide better work/life balance and near the same income, possibly with opportunity to advance. I am well versed in all things business and have enough common sense and intelligence to figure out just about anything that's not to specialized. I have a triple BS in small business, economics, and marketing with minors in accounting and HR. 

The biggest problem I see when scrolling job boards is income potential. I currently earn around $275k/ year. I would be satisfied with $200k as long as there were advancement opportunities or the potential to earn more. 

What industry could I look at that may be a good fit? What specific jobs could I move into that would make sense with my degrees and particular business accumen on starting and operating units? Or managing large numbers of people?

Any advice is appreciated!"

1491,"I was a few minutes late to an interview, how much does that affect my chances of getting hired?",jobs,"I just had the interview (done remotely via Zoom), which I think went well, and it was for a small start-up so the interviewer was actually the CEO/founder. But I had the bad luck of having the lights go out a few minutes before the interview due to a circuit breaker tripping. I had to fix that and was late for the interview by 3 minutes. I explained to the CEO and he said it was no big deal. However, I also replied to the company's first email to me 2 days late.

I did not see the email in my inbox which I admit was my fault. I only saw the original email after they sent a second email to me. However, I did give a very detailed reply and apologized for replying late. 2 days had passed since the email was first sent, and the scheduled interview was the next day after I finally replied. It also turned out that that the second email to me was from the CEO since they needed to find somebody for a position quickly.

I'm afraid that the late email situation combined with me joining the interview late, my chances of getting hired were affected. And I'm afraid that since I already replied to an email late, the CEO would think that I was lying when I explained why I joined the interview late.

Am I overthinking? Are they gonna think that I'm terrible at time management and will be late to everything?"

1497,Stuck between two job offers!,jobs,"I‚Äôll keep it brief! Two state jobs in different fields, one related to my degree (Job #1), and one only vaguely related (Job #2). My background is that I graduated college in late 2021.

Job #1 is one I already have, but I‚Äôm currently only part-time. My boss just offered a full time position. I‚Äôve already been with the company a few months.  The work is engaging, and I like the environment and coworkers. I could grow within this company, or at least use it as a hearty reference in the next year or two. The downside is that it has a long commute time (an hour), and no paid vacation time. I could try moving closer, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd make enough to justify moving.

Job #2 would be a transition into another field, but it is related to what I studied in college. I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I would like the work, although it is something I‚Äôd like to explore eventually. Pros are that long term career growth have a higher ROI than Job #1 in the long term, and I wouldn‚Äôt struggle to find work in my area should I decide to move around. It‚Äôs also a much shorter commute time (&lt;20 min). Cons are that it pays less, and seems less engaging (only based on how it was described to me by the hiring manager). Like the other job, no paid leave. 

Both companies are interested in my having upward mobility, but Job #2 seems to have a more clear plan about it than Job #1 (no guarantees for either though). I‚Äôm leaning towards Job #1, but the commute time is a killer and I recognize the value in Job #2. Let me know what y‚Äôall think!"

1520,Interviewing for a job that I'd like to use as leverage for a promotion at my current job. Advice appreciated,jobs,"Hi Reddit. Looking for some advice here. 

I work at a law firm in a southern state as an administrative assistant. I like my job and I really like the people I work with. I've been here about 8 months. Back in the beginning of November, one of our attorneys (let's call her S from now on) called me in her office and told me she thought I was doing a great job and asked if I'd be interested in taking a position as her legal assistant. Of course, I told her I was. S said she'd talk to my boss (who is essentially the office manager, let's call her A) about how to go about replacing me and that she wasn't promising anything but she was considering me. I said okay great, I'll wait to hear from you. a couple days later A calls me in to her office and asked me what I thought about taking the job. I told her I was very interested and she said that S was still interviewing people and that she wished the S had spoke to her before speaking to me so she would have had extra warning to put up an ad for my job because honestly, a lot goes in to being an administrative assistant at a law firm and obviously I'd need to train whoever replaced me, and it was sort of shitty of S to offer this to me without details and without speaking to my immediate supervisor. 

At the end of the week S called me back in and said that she'd decided to go with someone else, that she'd hired her on a temporary basis and that it wasn't because they didn't think I'd do a good job, but because they needed someone as soon as possible and it would just take too much to get someone comfortable in the administrative assistant role for things to work out right now. I was a little upset, I told her that I understood but that I thought it was handled poorly. when I spoke to my boss that day, I told her the same, and she agreed with me. she gave me a small raise and asked one of the paralegals to let me shadow her to learn more about how the job works, which was actually a great experience. 

The girl they ended up hiring for the legal assistant position (let's call her M) started at the beginning of November and while she was perfectly nice, I'll be honest: she just couldn't keep up. She wasn't working out, and that became apparent to everyone within a month. M took the week of Christmas off (her hometown and family are states away and she was going to visit. She informed them that she'd be doing this before she took the job, no biggie.) S asked if I'd be interested helping out with legal assistant tasks for the time M was out. Knowing that M was already on the rocks, I agreed, and I did really well filling in. When M returned the next week, her temporary contract was due to expire and S let her know that they wouldn't be offering her a permanent position. Honestly, M didn't seem surprised or terribly upset, I think she knew this wasn't for her. 2 days later S called me back into her office and asked if I was interested in the position. I told her I was. S said that she'd like to have me do legal assistant tasks in my down time (January has been slow, so I honestly have plenty of time and I've learned a lot!) and that if it worked out she would be offering me a permanent position within the next month. I wasn't sure what to make of this, I just said okay let's see how it goes. S let my boss know about the arrangement, and I've now been doing this for about a week and a half, and they are quite pleased with me, it seems. 

here's the issue: I was contacted by another law firm I applied to a couple months ago (gotta keep your options open, you know?) about a legal assistant position. I did a phone interview and i was honest with them that while I'd filled in for our legal assistants and done well, I was not, myself, an experienced legal assistant. The phone interview went well, now they'd like me to come in for a final interview tomorrow. It's a good job- much more than I make now, decent health insurance and decent benefits. Roughly the same as what legal assistants make at the firm I work for now. Obviously, I'm going to go to the interview. 

Here's my issue: I would prefer to take the job at the firm I work for now, if I knew it would be permanent. I really like the environment, I have a good relationship with everyone and I enjoy it. ideally, if I am offered the job I'd like to use it as leverage to secure a permanent legal assistant position at my firm. 

how do I go about that? If the job is offered to me, should I go to my A (or S?) and tell them what I've been offered and that they can either match/beat it or I'll be putting in my 2 weeks? I hate to do that, I really do like my job, but I'm not willing to stay in the position I'm in and if they can't pay me as much as I've been offered elsewhere and offer me a permanent position ASAP, I will take the other job, because I really need it, and because I'm good at this work. any advice???"

1526,Stepping down from management after only 1 month?,jobs,"TL;DR at the bottom! Little vent below.

I've worked at a greenhouse growing medicinal cannabis for about a year now. Even though the job has serious downsides (similar to that of all labour jobs), the work is really interesting and I enjoy being active, not having to deal with customers, and learning a lot of new knowledge and skills. 

I recently stepped up into a crew lead role. I am helpful and hardworking, and tend to take on pseudo-leadership roles while there are gaps in management, so I was heavily encouraged to apply by upper management and thought I would thrive. I have been in this role 1 month as of yesterday. 

As it turns out, I don't deal well with having to be part of the ""corporate"" side of things. I've butted heads with superiors numerous times over things I think are ethically wrong (strong-arming employees into mandatory overtime with short notice), and agreeing with employees over any complaints (which I consider valid) gets me hour-long meetings about how I'm not being a team player and how supporting the business is the #1 priority. Generally, I hate the politics. 

It is only a $2 difference in pay, and I find that I'm really missing the simplicity of just being a worker. I worked hard, and got to go home without any emotional burdens or a need to be ""on"" while not working. I hate getting emails and work texts at all hours of the night and on the weekend. I hate being told ""you're here first in the morning and leave last at the end of the day no matter what"" when I have a life outside of work as much as anyone. 

I'm heavily considering stepping down back into my old position. I'm nervous though; is there a chance they'll just fire me? We're pretty strapped for good workers, but I'm still not sure. Would it be so awkward that I end up quitting anyway? 

TL;DR: Considering stepping down from my management role after only 1 month, back into a worker role, since I miss the simplicity and better work-life balance. Has anyone done this? What were the consequences? Did you regret it?

Thanks for any help. :)"

Now today, Tuesday, she emails me and asked if we ever connected on the role,  and then she sent another email saying disregard the last email, I‚Äôll talk to you THIS Friday. We never scheduled another interview this Friday and she basically forgot she even interviewed me???

1537,Unsure what jobs to be applying for after totally losing confidence‚Ä¶,jobs,"26F‚Ä¶I worked retail(Bath &amp; Body Works) for 6+ years. Worked my way up to assistant manager, so I had various positions under my belt;sales, stocking, hiring, training, scheduling-you name it, I took it on. Eventually stepped down due do a total shift in the company in regards to the selling culture. Overall, I loved the customer interaction. I was incredibly passionate about the product. The pay was amazing($21/hr) and benefits were fantastic as well. Biggest negatives were the crazy hours and the extreme pressure to hit sales goals.

Switched gears to a local bank. Definitely was a more easy going environment considering the long list of regulations. Worked as a teller for a few months and moved up to a banker. I was always the one to be put on special community/branch projects, or to learn new programs and teach them to the team(was the most tech savvy). Pay was decent($16 and some odd change/hr) benefits also fantastic. Due to it being a community bank, we were always very slow and I have a lot of energy. I loved getting to dress fancy, but I was a little loud/peppy compared to my coworkers. Hated standing/sitting in one spot for 8 hours a day.

I stayed there about 2 years, until I was approached by my old BBW manager(we had our ups and downs working together)about this ‚Äúamazing company‚Äù.  It was a restoration company, like ServPro or ServiceMaster. She had explained it to me as, ‚Äúcleaning clients personal belongings after they experience fires or floods.‚Äù Pretty simple, sounds fun. she saw me as a good fit because I was pretty knowledgeable about the value of things. I toured the warehouse for their contents department. It seemed easy enough and I would always be busy. Plus, it‚Äôs only a few minutes down the road from where I‚Äôm living. downside was the pay, I was at least able to negotiate $15.50/hr, but that put me living paycheck to paycheck. I quit the bank after interviewing to be a ‚Äòcontents cleaner‚Äô or a ‚Äòrestoration tech‚Äô. One of the higher-ups that I had interviewed with asked if I would ever be interested in moving up in position, and I replied ‚Äúmaybe somewhere down the line, I would like to just give this initial position a try first to see what it entails.‚Äù Mind you, everyone heavily stressed that this was a new department for the company, and they were constantly creating new positions. So the job didn‚Äôt have much of a ‚Äúroles and responsibilities ‚Äúto it. 
My first day on the job was an absolute nightmare. There were no managers there, so I was accidentally sent out in the field to a warehouse fire with improper clothing/gear for that week. Once all the managers had come back, everything was sorted and I was put back where I had thought it was hired for-in the cleaning room.  Fast forward a month or two..they fire the warehouse lead and they‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm actually a ‚Äúrestoration lead ‚Äúand that really I should be out in the field, but that they will try to create some thing for me in house-meaning they‚Äôre making me take over as a warehouse lead. This company also still has not got me a uniform, and I am ruining my personal clothing weekly at this job. Once they finally get me a uniform it‚Äôs the wrong size and I‚Äôm told I need to go figure out and exchange it myself.I am no longer simply cleaning items. Multiple times, they have tried to push me to be forklift certified so I can move our storage vaults around. That is some thing I refused, as I do not feel comfortable on a vehicle like that, nor with my pay change having that certification.I have to train all of the new temps(who are actually making more per hour than me), manage our inventory, schedule deliveries&amp;subcontractors, and so much more. The best part-they refuse to pay me more because I‚Äôm already making more than other leads and core staff. I have no problem being vocal about how terrible and how misleading this company has been to me, especially with me reporting to my old(new) manager. All I get is a slew of excuses. This all wouldn‚Äôt be so bad‚Ä¶ what they‚Äôre asking me to do isn‚Äôt all that difficult‚Ä¶but the pay is what kills me. AND their benefits are horrendous. No one I interviewed with could give me straight numbers on insurance cost, etc., and I‚Äôm learning now it‚Äôs because none of them actually take advantage of it because it‚Äôs so expensive, especially considering I am breathing soot or mold in on a daily basis. For $160/month($6k deductible) I only have health insurance. At my previous jobs for less than that amount, I was able to have Health, dental, contribute to a 401(k) that also had a match, and contribute to an HSA. Their only answer for me is to go on government health insurance. I want out of this place, to The point where I wouldn‚Äôt even bother giving them my two weeks.

It‚Äôs my own fault for taking this job, and probably not asking enough questions at the beginning. But in a weird way this has been a huge blow to my confidence. I used to feel like I could conquer anything, and now I don‚Äôt feel good enough for any job listings that I look at. So far, I‚Äôve turned down one job that I was excepted for, due to learning about the poor management. Another job that I had passed the initial interview, I was rejected, due to relatives(my whole family is in this business, and a cousin of mine has been fired from nearly every company due to laziness.) At this point, I don‚Äôt even feel confident enough in myself to be applying other places.

I also feel like I‚Äôm being way too picky with what I want. First shift, Monday through Friday. I never want to go back to having to work weekends and holidays. Good pay, good benefits. I did not go to college, outside of taking a few uncredited courses at a tech school. I‚Äôm A very fast learner, always willing to take on whatever is handed to me. I used to love client interaction, but being stuck in a warehouse with the same peopl has made me almost fearful of having a job where I interact with people outside of my coworkers again. It feels like all of my passion in life has been sucked out of me at this place, and I‚Äôm not really sure where to go from here. I want a new job, but I have this strange fear and I don‚Äôt have a clue what field to turn to. I‚Äôm always finding some reason to say ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be good at that job‚Äù. Any advice? 


TLDR;; My current job is absolute garbage and has sucked the spark out of me, to the point where I feel in capable of thriving elsewhere.  I need to find a new Monday through Friday 9 to 5 job with proper pay and benefits, but I‚Äôm not sure what field will suit me."
1538,Just took off work early for a surprise interview only to find out nobody was there and later be told I was too expensive.,jobs,"This is wild. I had a phone screening for a relatively small company late last week that seemed promising. The recruiter thought I was a great fit for the role and seemed genuinely excited for me to come meet the owner and team. She said I'd get an email invite before COB Friday for one of the days/times I preferred this week. Friday rolls around, no email. Monday comes, no email. So I reached out this morning around 11:00 AM to see what the word was. She said she would send it again and that it was today at 3:00 PM. I'm sorry what? Cue to me rushing home at 1 to make it to their office by 3 with a shaved face and dressed up in a tie. 

Well I get there about 5 minutes early and ring their front desk. Someone answered and was surprised to hear there's an interview at that time since EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME FOR THE DAY. So I have just taken a half day of work only to be told I'd have to come back another time... Great... As I head home I get a call from the owner who is apologetic but doesn't seem to really mean it. He tells me he's sorry and that half the company is out with covid and that's why he forgot. Apparently he didn't even come into the office that day because of it. He asks if I'm able to chat over the phone about my qualifications and the role. I'm like sure no problem. He then goes on to tell me that he hasn't even looked at my resume because his recruiter sent him a password protected copy and he hadn't been able to open it. 

So there I was, driving home, basically reciting my resume to him over the phone. He asked me if I had experience with a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't even on the job posting and I told him I knew about all of it to the extent that I'd be able to pick it up within 2 months; which is honestly better than most people can ask for. He asked me about my salary expectations, and when I told him what my experience was going for in today's market he shut me down and said I'd be a good fit for an entry level position but since I have the experience for a senior engineer, I'm too expensive for what they'd get out of me. 

I dropped everything to waste half a day of PTO and drive 80 miles only to have a 20 minute phone interview where I get told I'm not a good fit. If this company had done a single thing right, I would   
not have had to waste half a day. Fuck job hunting."

1540,What Are the Best Temp Jobs Out There?,jobs,"I'm really trying to figure out what the best work option is for me. Currently, I'm working at Amazon and I cannot take it anymore. I need work that is going to fit my schedule as well as it be work where there is more life/people interaction and that isn't monotonous while remaining safe in these Covid times.

I need hours are flexible, that don't consume my day but still work hand and hand as I am a content creator/rising artist. (looking to do the job for at least 6 months) Any suggestions?? I'd appreciate it !!"
1541,"Is it normal to have a boss, on their day off, create diagrams/give reasons why you should step down and are unqualified, trying to both convince me and his superior about it being the right move?",jobs,"He's been demoralizing me in meeting and my boss personally took I'm aside and brought up how that's not excusable. She wasn't taking my side but brought up how petty it was, and now it's a thing where he has a binder ready to throw down and basically give a presentation about how his training was perfect and that I just am untrainable in his eyes."

1543,Job hopping is a must now a days (venting),jobs,"Hey everyone just wanted to vent for a minute. It truly seems like job hopping has become the ultimate way to get to the salary you want. I have a group of friends and they just completed the full circle all 6 have now increased their salaries by 30% (the last one got his new job offer this morning)and they all were only looking for jobs for 3 months or less. 

To answer none of them are in the tech field but they are all at least supervisors but the fact that in only 3 months or less they have all increased their salaries by a minimum of 30% and none were at their employer for more than a year. 

Also some insight all but 1 are 6 figures with the only one not being around 80k yearly. So why the hell should you stay at your current roles get your yearly 3-4% raise when companies are literally handing out money and need the people?"
1544,Are commission jobs/self employed jobs such as insurance agent/sales worth it?,jobs,"Some background: I‚Äôm 22 with a gf and 10 month old daughter. I am currently working two jobs and 50-60 hours a week and currently make around 30-40k a year. I have been in a job hunt the last few weeks in order to increase my income as well as replace my two jobs in order to spend more time at home at nights and on weekends with my gf and daughter. 

During my job search and multiple interviews, I notice that many sales rep jobs and insurance agent jobs are trying to lure applicants with salaries such as 75k-125k+ from commission where you can sent your own hours and appointments and meet clients and earn weekly commissions with tax write offs as well

As someone who has no direct experience with commission jobs and don‚Äôt know many people personally that have had commission jobs, I decided to post in here and ask here if anyone has commission only jobs/self employed jobs and if these claims such as high commissions and tax write offs and ease of schedule are really true or is it a lot of promises to entice people to apply when in reality it‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows? I wish to increase my income and hopefully save for a house in the near future. Any advice regarding these commission jobs and sales jobs would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
1545,My boss told me that my job is not important,jobs,"I just started a job at a state prison and so far it's been fine. However with the mounting amount of people that are catching covid, we have a bunch of paperwork and shit that needs to be documented and input etc. This is actually a more specialized job that is above my pay grade because these positions have special access to confidential files and what not. They are overwhelmed with work so my boss asked me to help them out. He said ""well all you do is check emails and update logs, your job isn't that important"". 

On my first day he made it seem like I was the central hub for all our business needs and I have to be in constant communication with everyone and that my job is very time sensitive blah blah. When shit hits the fan, he says my job isn't important. It was a slap in the face.

And I'm not sure why I can't work from home if my job is so unneeded. I feel...  used."
1546,Terrified to try the job market again,jobs,"I started a job with a company back in October. It's been terrible the entire time. I can't finish a single project because of the lack of support. My manager doesn't understand most of the issues I'm having as he's only part time, and supervising me is not his main priority.

I've been told another person in the company is being groomed for his role, and she's an absolute nightmare. Every time we are supposed to work together I end up doing all the work. I have communicated this to my boss and he says that's just how she is. 

Some of the people in the company are really nice, but I'm really at my breaking point. I feel bad for wanting to leave after only 3 months. I don't even know how I'd explain it when potential employers ask about it. 

When I was job hunting back in August it was so hard to even get an interview and with the mass resignation I'm even more worried."
1547,Is this email response I received a scam?,jobs,"This is the email I got after applying for a job. It is raising a thousand red flags but maybe I am crazy and paranoid.

1551,Interviewed for a job but no one knows what exactly the role is,jobs,"I applied for a job based on a job description that met my all of my personal and career goals. The first interview went without a hitch, they affirmed the description but when I asked specifics about the role they shared that the position was grant funded and the entity providing the grant would have many more specific details which I could ask about in the second interview. They almost immediately followed up with my references but took 3 weeks to schedule a second interview, I was annoyed but whatever. Today, I had the second interview and they asked me what I understood the role to be (which I literally rephrased the job description) they said no, it wasn‚Äôt that. They then described an entirely different job role that would require a shit ton of different experience. Still I went about the interview and did a good job, when I asked questions again about the job specifics and about their goals for this new position they literally did not have a single answer. I get that the position is new and there may be a lot of room for establishing the role but to have interviewed twice for two seemingly different roles, and still not have any clarification on wtf the job entails is infuriating. 

It felt like they got some extra money and are just trying to create a BS role to throw the money at. The worst part is it‚Äôs in maternal child health which desperately needs the kind of role I thought I was applying for ü§¨"
1552,what is going on with Indeed job applications?,jobs,"I applied for two paralegal jobs.  I uploaded my resume.   I uploaded a cover letter.   Then I was sent to take some ""skills"" tests that were bizarre - looking at three pictures and picking another shape that was closest, that type of thing.  I skipped it.   That brought me to a multiple choice type test that had nothing to do with my job.  I skipped it.   Then I was asked to write some paragraphs.  I skipped that too.  Fwiw, both employers reached out to me to schedule interviews.  Indeed keeps spamming me to finish the so-called skills tests"
1553,Did I make the right decision?,jobs,"So I recently quit my job at a headshop because a lot of things were going on that I just didn‚Äôt agree with and I also felt like I wasn‚Äôt appreciated enough. To explain the story (this will be lengthy my apologies to anyone who reads this) , I found this job on indeed and I reached out to one of the owners. He‚Äôs a younger guy, age 27, and he owns the shop with his older brother whose in his 40‚Äôs. So initially I reached out to the younger brother as his contact info was the only available. I called three different times and each time he told me he would interview me and have me start immediately. It wasn‚Äôt until a few days later when I reached out to him again that he finally allowed me to come into work. I should have known something was fishy from the start when anytime I tried to come in to help set up the store the younger brother kept telling me he would be late coming and he even ghosted me an entire day and left me in my car waiting at his establishment for him. I eventually went home and texted him the next day asking if he was ok and he claimed he had to take his dog to the vet.This was a brand new store that hadn‚Äôt even opened yet. After we finally got some organization, I helped set up the store and it was only me and him setting it up at the time. His older brother only showed up a few days before grand opening. So one of the other issues I had was the fact that I was working a part time job as well as helping these two with their store. (Going on further we will give my ex bosses anonymous names to make this easier lol. The younger ones name is adam and the older one David.) So adam promised me a manager position if I quit my other job and since I wanted full time I went for it. So after the grand opening a few days after I never heard from Adam or David as to when I was supposed to come into work. So I text and call for an entire week and no response so I drive to the store and I saw a new employee working inside ringing customers so of course I‚Äôm furious because I haven‚Äôt worked in an entire week and they never reached out to me so I brought up my concerns to David and he simply said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough money to have you both here‚Äù. So conversation goes on and he tells me I need to be patient lol. So I finally start being able to work after I kept letting them know that I quit my job for this because I was told I would run the store and work 40 hours a week. So as time goes on we hire more people and things start to get worse. So all the employees were getting paid cash and not direct deposit for at least 3-4 paychecks. We have our personal information like Social security number and Drivers license to Adam who claimed would set us up direct deposit but never did. I took matters into my own hands and decided to volunteer to count the hours of each employee and set up the payroll by contacting the Tax Lady who handles the payroll for my ex bosses business. After multiple conversations with the tax lady she tells me that sharif never returns her calls nor contacts her about anything regarding the payroll to help out the situation to go smoother. So I ended up being the one to get everyone on payroll and direct deposit payments. I go out of my way to the library to print of hire forms and direct deposit slips on my personal time as well as a return policy sign. I also decorated the store for Halloween and Christmas and david was totally against giving any funds to decorate but I pleaded with him and he gave me a $100 limit lol. So anyway to make a few more gripes I had with the store besides my ex bosses. All the co workers are legitimately crazy and bad people. They all cheat on their spouses/significant others and bring them into work. One girl loved twerking on camera. The 40 year old man was a pervert and tried hitting on two of the women that worked there. Pathological liars etc etc. I felt like I was on a reality tv show because it all seemed so fabricated. But anywho. What caused me to really decide to leave was there was a girl that worked there named Brittany and she always did what she was asked to do, only issue with her was personal hygiene which I did talk to her about because david asked me to because he didn‚Äôt want to do it. So she was only working with us for a month. And david already wanted to fire her because of her b/o I believe. She didn‚Äôt do anything else wrong. So instead of firing/helping her b/o problem he basically bullied her and blamed anything that went wrong in the store on her. I went in one day to count up everyone‚Äôs hours and she came to me and said ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong but David has me working till I‚Äôm sweating today.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure either‚Äù so I proceed to count hours (on my off day mind you) and david calls Brittany over to say this : ‚Äúyou see all this shelves looking nice and neat? That‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt sit around and do nothing.‚Äù And she replied saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be professional here but I‚Äôve noticed you‚Äôve been taking everything out on me lately and blaming me and I bust my ass everyday I come into work (which she does). And David‚Äôs response was ‚ÄúJust go home Brittany we don‚Äôt need you today.‚Äù And of course she starts to cry and leaves and then he texts her and fires her. That was the last straw for me so I told him I couldn‚Äôt keep working for them anymore. And everything that I typed isn‚Äôt even half of the horrible things they‚Äôve done to me or other employees. If anyone wants an entire list of things I‚Äôll gladly write it all down but my story is already too long. Lol thoughts on this?"

Today I was sent home in the middle for potential COVID Symptoms today. Supposedly I was coughing and sneezing more than usual. I don‚Äôt think I was, but I nevertheless my boss said to go home so I did. I spoke to HR and they said to take an at home test and if I feel fine and it‚Äôs negative to come back to work tomorrow. 

Is this time that I lost paid or unpaid? I work in California. 

FWIW my at home test tells me I‚Äôm negative. And I feel perfectly fine. I did take half a day off yesterday for a job interview I wonder if this is sort of retaliatory. But I doubt because my boss has always been Covid paranoid(as in lysols the air after we talk type paranoid)"

Last week he sent a letter to HR saying the claims were unsubstantiated and that all 7 employees retracted their statements. He lied. All the people involved are very upset by what happened and none of them did such a thing.

1557,Settle a life or move abroad?,jobs,"Hey, I'm writing this cause I'm facing a bit of a situation. I'm undecisive as to what to do with my life. 

To give you a sniff of background, I'm 23 yesrs okd who lives in South East Asia. I graduated from university about roughly a year ago and I possess the bachelor of Civil Engineering. I'm working now in an engineering consultant (project management) at the moment. I wouldn't say I'm happy with my job, other from the fact that it doesn't pay well, I think I wouldn't grow personally and professionally. I always struggle with depression my whole life and I don't think living here is beneficial to my mental health hence I don't think I would achieve happiness here. Why aren't I searching for another job? Let me elaborate my struggle. 

Since a little child, I've always had the dream to move abroad since I don't feel belong here. I'm grateful for that the place my country provides since I've been here my whole life. I'm in my comfort zone at the moment since I still live with my parents. Of course, moving abroad requires lots of money and I'd still be funded by my parents. They're trying to sell the house we are currently living in to gain extra money for my migration. Furthermore, I think starting a new life, I could grow maturely and don't have to depend on my parents anymore. I want to improve my quality of life. I'm planning to move this year (hopefully). I still need to do some paper works and english exam to be considered by the government. 

For that reason, I don't want to build my career here and instead, I want to take master course while working part-time there and then we'll see what happens. It's gonna be a huge bet, but I need to move out from my comfort zone. 

I'm curious and intrigued to gear your thoughts/opinions on this. Thank you in advance for listening."

Always the dreaded question: *""What are your salary expectations?""* \- I'm a female, and I've been under-compensated before. I can't just add $10k to my previous/current salary and call it a day because in many cases I know that's below or at the bottom of their range. 

For reference, I am an experienced Photo/Video Content Producer in San Diego. It's not a cheap city to live in. My hourly rate varies *a lot* depending on if a job is full-time or freelance, includes benefits or not, etc. 

I've read that California is one of those states where employers legally have to provide a budgeted range if asked - is that true? Usually when I turn the question around to them I get ""oh hm well this is a new role/we don't have an exact range/we're still deciding"" from them. Money is not my deciding factor for accepting the right job, but it would be a bummer to find out later that I left $20k or more on the table."

1580,Is it normal for companies to changer your job title or job focus upon hire?,jobs,"Example 1: I started out at a company 3 years ago.

In this role, I did prepare some journal entries.

Example 2: I recently accepted an offer to work as a staff accountant at a different company. The job description listed a lot of G/L type accounting. When I started last week, I was told that I am a Staff Accountant in the Treasury under a Sr. Treasury Analyst.  Most day-to-day duties are reconciling the cash account and no G/L posting. At my previous company, everyone in the treasury department had a title of Treasury Analyst or Sr. Treasury Analyst and worked under a Treasury Manager‚Ä¶ Is this company ripping me off of salary because my title is Staff Accountant and not Treasury Analyst?

Which took me by surprise because very lately all the other managers have been pulling me aside and thanking me for my hard work? 

She told me I need to start running, which I have been doing all day? And what the other managers have thanked me for. 

And she tells me I take too long on the board. But with the other managers they have instead been cheering and complimenting me for becoming faster and better at it. 

I worked as hard as I could, and it's true I did mix up one order that day but otherwise I've managed to not make any other mistakes. And that issue was resolved quickly and the customers were also really reasonable.

She also got mad at me when she had to open the lids to the bags of ice cream for me. But I literally cannot open them myself no matter how hard I try, and usually end up asking someone to open them for me.

1586,How best to prepare for an internal interview?,jobs,"Hi everyone, 

I recently applied for a position at my company for an internal position. My manager will remain my manager, but I will now be under the supervisor of the department. 

My department manager (not in the interview panel) has taken a special interest in me and teaching me what he knows before he retires in a couple days. On several occasions even broke the line of command and requested to my manager that I speak directly to him on certain important projects where we would jointly make decisions before informing my manager. 

In addition to that my current manager was the one who encouraged me to apply for the position since he is aware of my financial position with the rising cost of living. 

The interview panel consists of my current manager, another supervisor (whom I‚Äôve worked with for a few weeks on a project), and a manager whom I‚Äôve never had to report to but thinks very highly of me and talks highly of me to other managers she is close to of my work ethic and my unique way of problem solving.


That being said I‚Äôm qualified fully for the position but have to compete against 4 other internal candidates and two external. 

How should I prepare for this interview? 

I also plan to ask for 4K additional outside of the posted range for the position which would give me a 10k increase and compensate for the exorbitant rise in cost of living. (And I need just to have a $600 a month in disposable income up from $120 after taxes) (still 5k less than what the market says I‚Äôm worth)

If they ask what I expect for a salary I plan to ask if the posted salary range has been revised since posting and if so and that I‚Äôm flexible and would accept a salary consummate with my experience and that I also plan to have my professional license by the end of next fiscal year (which comes with an additional automatic 5% increase in salary). Is this the right approach? 

How should I use inside knowledge of processes and applications to my advantage? 

Is there anything else I should prepare for or know? 

Thank you for your help!"
1587,Anyone quit from working at a job due to the owner and management not caring nor following COVID policies?,jobs,"I started working at my first part time job that did not follow any COVID policies at all which didn't bother me at first since I am vaccinated and as long as I wore my mask and always stayed sanitized but now during the season of winter more cases have been going up and multiple family relatives of mine have been testing positive and experiencing the symptoms. And unfortunately one of them has passed away with it as they were also diabetic. Im starting to get back with realizing how very risky it is now working at my own job as customers, most of my co workers,  one of the managers, and even the owner himself just don't care about it not mandating mask for us or even the customers. The job I work at is a front desk at a gym and this is now telling me how selfish and much reckless the owner and management is doing risking us employees getting sick and having gym members maskless spreading among the facility. I even checked the reviews and found out alot of members tried to cite the place. And management refuses to let county members visiting the place by making us give out envelopes to them denying them access and avoiding any questions they ask which I find very concerning.
So far from working there, I love what I'm doing, i gained a good amount of experience, I'm okay with my pay, my co workers and one of my managers are really nice and cool with me, even had some great talk getting to know gym members checking in, but since we're still basically in a pandemic, even though I knew the risk in the beginning,  at this point its starting to get me how reckless it is and Im deciding on  making the most of my job and think of giving out my notice by the start of early February.

Is it wise to take the PPO right now and join the company after graduation, meanwhile doing an internship parallel to college?

context:

* I'm a year 3 (of 4) Engineering student from India with major in computer science
* internship went smooth
* in a tech stack that I had never worked on
* learned a lot of new things - basically an entirely new stack
* the team is awesome, friendly, and the work is interesting, w/life balance is good
* i'm in college (online) - Year 3 - Semester 6 just started, good GPA, significant OSS experience
* companies come to college for internship/placements in starting of semester 7
* I **really need** to learn problem-solving if I want to interview in other companies.
* I have worked on some very interesting projects, so very confident on that part.
* I plan to do DSA side by side, even if I get the PPO.

questions I have:

* I might face a lock-in, meaning that if I am not strong in DSA, might become difficult in the later future?
* but if I continue for \~2 years and reach SDE-2 level, i get
   * (1) more time to prepare for DSA,
   * (2) interviews move towards design, something that I am good at.
   * (3) lots of learning in a startup in early stages
* are there other companies that I can apply to based on my experience and not DSA screening?

TLDR: should I

1. take the PPO, continue internship and join full time
2. don't take PPO, prepare for interviews this semester, apply to companies (including current one)

I reached out to them after undergrad for an internship but they said it was not a good time (their industry was really struggling in 2017). Right now, they have a lot of open positions and a huge need for people working for them. Im wondering the best way to contact them that will give me the best chance to work for them as soon as possible.

Here are my options:

1) Volunteer. There is a volunteer informational meeting on Jan 18. Pros: I could get to know the organization and network with leadership. Cons: This is a year-long commitment. Ideally I want to bring up working for them sooner than that. I would have to get a different job somewhere else for a year while I‚Äôm volunteering, and they might not be hiring in a year. Now is the time to work for them

2) Intern. They have lots of unpaid internships that last six months and are geared towards college students. Pros: Networking and getting direct experience in this field. I‚Äôm coming from a slightly different background (moving from college student services to social services) so this would bolster my resume. Cons: Is this underselling myself? Its six months of unpaid work with no job guarantee. My family (who I live with while I‚Äôm job searching)wouldn‚Äôt be very happy seeing me as an unpaid intern after years of higher education and debt. I tend to feel that way too. 

3) Apply for a job. I could cold apply. I‚Äôve thought of sending an email to the director explaining how much I want to work there and that I tried back in 2017. I‚Äôve thought of emailing them my resume with a cover letter explaining my skills and asking where they could see my skills fitting in their organization (letting them decide if I should intern or work right away). Cons: they don‚Äôt know me at all and might reject me on that basis. I could also use some direct experience in this field first (see: volunteer or intern).

The person answering the phone may (or may not) end up being the lead receptionist. The lead receptionist just so happens to also perform a few HR functions and may present herself as HR personnel.

1613,"Request: Is there a source for recommended ""lowest wage you should accept"" for each job title?",jobs,"In wholesaling, there's something known as MAP (minimum advertised price) where wholesalers instruct retailers the minimum price they're allowed to advertise the product for.  I'm wondering if there's something similar to this, but for jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

There's all kinds of ways you can price your time for a salary negotiation:

**Market Value of Your Skills**:

‚Ä¢ **Average of what other people with that job title make** (optional: in a specific region, or with companies of a specific size or industry) -- very popular, but I believe the mode is more telling than the average

‚Ä¢ **Mode of what other people with that job title make** (optional: in a specific region, or with companies of a specific size or industry) -- not as popular, but I believe much more effective in a negotiation

‚Ä¢ **Minimum of what other people with that job title make** (optional: in a specific region, or with companies of a specific size or industry) -- not as popular

‚Ä¢ **Based off the pay offered from alternative offers**: other job offers you've received, your current job you're contemplating leaving, or job postings for similar positions in the area who are hiring for a specific wage.  If a place wants to hire you for $20 an hour, but there's an offer in the area for $25 an hour, that's major leverage.

**Your Personal Needs**:

‚Ä¢ **Based off your monthly expenses and debt** (pricing based off the minimum you need to make to breakeven for the month) -- very popular, but the problem with this is there's always going to be someone with lower expenses than you who can do the work for cheaper, so this ultimately drives the value of your time down in the long run if 

‚Ä¢ **Based off money needed for your expenses and future goals**: retirement, car, mortgage, kids, travel -- semi-popular method, but harder to give convincing rationale for in a negotiation

&amp;#x200B;

A great negotiation technique I've come across, outside of salary negotiations, is having the negotiation somewhat out of your hands.  If you have to consult a decision maker, boss, dealer, etc, you earn yourself massive negotiating leverage.  If someone wants to purchase something for $10 that you're only authorized to sell for $15, you have leverage.

That's why I'm wondering if there's a source of information for industries that give recommendations for the lowest amount of money you should accept for a job position.  Something like that could give massive leverage in negotiations."

Since then we have gone from a team of 5 senior resources &amp; 3 junior resources to 2 senior resources &amp; 3 junior resources. Additionally, the only reason we still even have 3 junior resources is because I have now rebuilt the team 2x and it is going on a 3rd time now due to people continuing to leave. My final senior resource who does a lot of the heavy lifting has now been laid off, and all of the work of the senior resources has been trickling down to me without any kind of compensation.

Now, I'm giving notice to my current job that I've had for four months, because I'm realizing they're a mess, and it's really stressful. 

The issue is, I don't know if I want my resume to look like I was unemployed 21 straight months after the pandemic, or if I want to show that it was only about one year and I actually worked for seven months, especially because both of the most recent jobs were comparatively high paying, near or above six-figure roles.

1623,YA Interview Attire post. Specific to STEM (Industry/Academia/Startups). Female input appreciated,jobs,"Hello all,

Yes, I know this gets asked a lot, but it's been a while since a relevant one came up. I think it would be nice to make this into a repository of recent, field-specific advice? For me and others...

I'm a 27yo female applying for research associate/specialist in a STEM field. I've noticed since high school, the interviews have gotten a lot more lax about clothing. I like that, but I'm on edge about it since I was always told to respectfully dress in a blazer, business formal. Well, my business formal clothes are way outdated now (2010 lol)

I've interviewed with a couple startups, both interviewers were totally casual. I was thankfully dressed 'nice' but not overdressed so I didn't feel too awkward. In academia, it's about the same, super casual (but slightly less organized). Now I have an interview for an industry position coming up, hence I wonder what to wear? I'd typically go for a nice, clean, smart-casual look, but this is an older biotech company that's pretty large, so I wonder what the psychology behind it would be, I tend to think go more formal. 

I know that once I get there it'll be scientist casual, but as a woman it's complicated to gauge what to wear for interviews. Guys get to wear a suit, but there's no uniform like that for females. Skirts/dresses seem like a bad idea even though I'm not in a lab for the interview (although I've worn skirts in a lab since I'm a biologist and things are slightly less chaotic/dangerous)."

I just don't know where to go to get the job I want or even where to look.

I have a HUGEEEEEEEEE passion for electronics, both software and hardware, and have messed around with both for many years. I've done things like build and program a video game controller out of Arduinos, made simple GPU like devices out of logic gates in video games, started to learn a bunch of different coding languages like Powershell and C#, and even in spare time I enjoy researching how things like old CRTs (which I collect) and old video game consoles worked on the hardware level. 

I'm just wondering, where can I go? I want a job I'd love, but I've never been to college and my entire family is against it saying it's a debt trap, but here I am currently stuck in retail and still living with family. I just don't know where to go or who to talk to."

I was one of the few people in over Christmas, and my boss arbitrarily took that week off without even an FYI that he wouldn't be in. He then cut his work schedule short and left the site earlier than planned.
Once he left, HR called me into their office and fired me. No warning, no notice of any misconduct, no explanation except to say they could fire me whenever because of being on probation.

1638,This insane job application I gave up on last night blew my mind.,jobs,"I posted the majority of this as a comment in response to another post, in another sub, and then decided it needs its own post as well. This experience was incredible, to me. 

I was applying to a *part time* remote chat gig that pays $*11.50*/hour just last night, to do in addition to my full time remote job for some extra money. 

Every time I thought I‚Äôd completed the app, more steps arose. They had little green check marks on each section completed, with like three sections at a time, and then BOOM, a new list populated. 

Before I quit the app, I made it far enough to complete 

- five fill in the blank style questions that required paragraphs-long responses to how you‚Äôd handle work situations 

- 10 questions that required you search their mock-database to appropriately select pre-scripted answers to customer emails/chats/complaints 

- a portion where you explained via email that an ‚Äúorder had been delayed due to a severe blizzard on the east coast‚Äù and that the customer ‚Äúcould call the phone support line between 8a-8p M-F for more information‚Äù in TWO ways (a ‚Äúcausal, friendly‚Äù answer and a ‚Äúformal, more professional‚Äù answer)

- an incredibly long typing test that required you get 100% accuracy and at least 70WPM (that had unlimited attempts)

- a portion involving describing your relevant experience (in response to three questions about said experience) in three separate blank sections (‚Äúwhat skills do you have that make you a good fit?‚Äú; ‚Äúwhat motivates you to do a good job?‚Äù; ‚Äúwhat experience do you have that makes you well suited for this role?‚Äù)

- AND a question asking ‚Äúhow you display empathy to customers‚Äù that you *had* to record and upload a voice response (using a provided website service) that was 60-90 seconds long for, with a note that you‚Äôd be judged on articulation, vocabulary, grammar, tone of voice and the answer itself 

*AFTER ALL OF THAT*, I was brought to the first of FIVE long sections of a multiple choice assessment. I stopped, at that point. No clue what would have come next. 

All of that for $11.50/hour part time work, no benefits (due to being part time), AND having to use your own equipment (computer etc.) was absolutely insane, to me. 

I wonder if anyone will even make it through that process. 

I genuinely don‚Äôt know where these companies get off thinking that this bologna is acceptable for such low pay and a complete lack of any perks at all.

I can‚Äôt even find the website, now, but believe the company was called ‚Äúwrrk‚Äù or something. I‚Äôll attempt to find the job posting on Indeed, should anyone be interested. Lastly, I‚Äôve gotten several emails saying that my application isn‚Äôt complete and I can finish it at any time, so I tried to respond to one explaining why I am not interested and how ridiculous their process is, but it was bounced back as undeliverable. The email doesn‚Äôt even list the name of the company in it (nor does the email address)."
1639,Are state government jobs overrated?,jobs,"I've been in my current position at a state agency for a little over three months now. Overall I'm not enjoying it as much as I thought I would.

The pros: 

* Hybrid remote schedule (3 days remote, 2 days in person)
* Steady hours (M-F, 8-5)
* Decent pay ($58k/year before tax &amp; deductions)
* Benefits are fairly solid

Cons:
* Poor communication between colleagues/supervisors. The department has grown from 4 people to over 20 people in a short amount of time, and it's clear they still need to adjust their comms strategies.
* Lack of training. I was essentially given a computer and some generic HR training modules 
* Lack of enough engaging/fulfilling work. On some days I go a whole day with maybe 1 or 2 emails to answer. I feel like I wasted my day in those situations.
* Feast-or-famine mode. On some other days a whole tornado of projects come in with an incredibly short turnaround time. The lack of consistency in the amount work is pretty frustrating.
* Bureaucracy. Coming from the private sector I was used to more autonomy and creative freedom. In the public sector I need to have 5 people approve any minuscule detail which holds up most projects. 
* Complicated supervisor. I get the feeling that my supervisor will not stand up for her employees if she needs to defend them. She's been in her current role for over 15 years and is constantly telling us about the rules to follow and how we're essentially on our own with figuring out our jobs. She's not readily available for calls or meetings -- as of right now I meet with her once a week for an hour.
* Job security uncertainty. Our department is being absorbed by another department later this year, and there have been talks of consolidation. If I don't have a good feeling about the status of my position ahead of the merger, I will have to start looking elsewhere.

I will probably end up finding another job that I'm more interested/invested in, likely in the private sector. In my private sector work I felt much more invigorated and had a clear sense of purpose. So far the public sector has shown me that it's nearly impossible for any efficiency and all of the work &amp; communication is so intentionally vague. 

Anybody else work in state or even federal government and just find it bland and unchallenging?"

I've fortunately had a new job offer paying 15k more than my current role.

I enjoy my current job but feel like I'm not progressing as quickly as I should from a career and salary perspective - this was the main driver for me looking out for new opportunities.

So my main question is - How/What is the best way of approaching my current manager (who I'm friendly with and like) without exposing the fact there is another offer on the table? I don't want them thinking I'm trying to force their hand for a promotion/raise, which is what I'm after really.

1650,Resume Question... New Job title but many responsibilities carried over.,jobs,"I am currently working on updating my resume, but I am struggling with how to format my most recent work experience.

I had gotten some really good feedback on my writing skills and was instead given the sole position as technical writer. 

Here's the curveball, even though my title changed and I do quite a bit of the writing for my company, I still have a lot of responsibilities from before. We are a small company, so I will do field visits quite often and will help out other departments like I used to.

How would I phrase this in my resume? I am actually trying to get work more resembling what I used to do since I enjoy being out in the field more."

Employee A is good friends with employee B, so it came as kind of a shock that they came to me with these issues, but they are significant and need to be addressed. I'm not sure how to go about confronting employee B about these issues without throwing employee A under the bus, as employee A let me know that they are the only one who is aware that the problem is taking place. 

For context, the employees work remotely occasionally, more frequently now with omicron making its rounds. Employee B has been clocking in and running errands for several hours instead of staying home and working. Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow for management (or anyone for that matter) to sufficiently track what the employees are currently working on and we must go off of our employees' word. Employee A has provided proof of employee  B not upholding their responsibilities while working from home. 

Basically what I'm looking for is some advice on how I can handle the situation without employee B suspecting that I was tipped off by employee A."

However, I applied to and didn‚Äôt hear back from multiple other jobs that I was interested in before. This last week I received a call for an interview for an opportunity I was really excited about when I applied back in November. Seeing how I had already accepted an offer I decided to let the opportunity go however they contacted me multiple times and I even received a call from the director of the department saying how much he liked my background and wanted the opportunity to speak with me. Since I don‚Äôt have anything to lose I asked him the salary range of the job. It‚Äôs low end is about 15k less than the offer at my new job but it‚Äôs high cap out is 11k over my new offer. 

I have let them know I‚Äôve accepted another offer. Should I tell them I won‚Äôt interview unless they are willing to offer me at least the same if not more than my current offer or should I interview first and then ask. Or should I just avoid them all together since I have another offer and start date set. Any advice is appropriated."
1653,Waiting on VP approvals - What takes so long?,jobs," Hello,

Long story short - I interviewed with a F500 bank, spoke with a few managers, and ultimately wasn't offered the position. However, one of the managers I spoke with reached out to HR stating that he wanted to hire me for a position that opened on his team. It's been about 2 weeks since that call and the HR states that they are still waiting on the VP for a couple of approvals. During my interview with that manager, they stated that they had just gotten the job approved. (\~3 weeks ago). HR told me that I don't have to reapply or interview again, so I am just waiting on these approvals.

My question is, if the job was approved when I interviewed, what other approvals are they waiting on from the VP?"

1665,Internship and advice,jobs,I am going to be graduating after one semester and I already have a full time position waiting in a pretty renowned company. I am taking full time classes next semester so I was wondering if you would recommend that I search for internship while taking classes and as well for the summer until I start my full time position? I don't start until August and I have classes until May but nice 2 months break before I start my full time gig. I do have a work experience and an internship experience prior.
1666,Want to ask for a raise but I don‚Äôt know how much I should be making currently?,jobs,"So I might be moving to a new position and I wanted to ask for a raise but tbh I don‚Äôt even know what I should be making now. I live in North East Indiana and I do not have a degree. 

I work in a distribution center and currently I make $15.75 an hour. I started a year ago at $14.50. On my first yearly review I got a very small raise like every one else and then later the entire warehouse got a dollar raise to compete with the new Amazon warehouse across the street from us that pays $17/hour. So obviously I was like dang where‚Äôs my $17? 

So I started at this distribution center packing boxes. And then over the course of one year management moved me between 3 new positions, each one taking on more roles, learning more on the computer about the companies software, and taking on more responsibility as well. 

Currently I do a job that requires me to know how to use the companies software very well and look at invoices, solve problems, make decisions based on (small amounts of) company money, and also still do some physical labor. I have deadlines every day. I know how to use the reports and software better than many of the supervisions and even some managers above me. And I‚Äôm making the same rate as workers who only pack boxes. (This is not a slight against packers, only a reason I think I should be making more) 

So NOW there is a new position in Inventory and the manager of this team requested me by name. I need to use my current knowledge and also learn quite a bit more and work even more with company money, vendors, and accounting. But i guess it‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúlateral move‚Äù so there‚Äôs no pay raise. 

So I know there‚Äôs a ton of questions about raises on her so I apologize‚Ä¶ but what should I be making with the skills I have learned? And should I ask for more? And should I decline the position if I cannot get a raise?"
1667,"I just got a job offer, but I don't know if I should take it or not. Can anyone provide some perspective for me? What is the correct ""career growth"" move?",jobs," Please bear with me as I give a few details.

I have been working for my uncle for 1.5 years in the utilities industry. I am a glorified receptionist. I schedule appointments, customer service/answering phones, a bit of accounting, accounts payable/receivable, routing for drivers, emails, paperwork for all of our installations, etc.

**Pay &amp; Benefits**: I started out at $17/hr (June 2020) and got a raise to $19/hr in August. I have health insurance for $200/mo which he graciously pays half of for his employees. No 401k. We get a cash Christmas bonus every year, each sequential year we work here we get $100 more than the last year.

**Vacation/PTO**: I get 2 weeks paid vacation per year. I can take off basically any time that I want as long as it's not conflicting with anything someone else has planned already. I get most paid federal holidays. No sick pay.

**Commute**: 25 miles, approx. 30-40 minutes depending on traffic/time of day.

**Other benefits:** Very laid-back work environment. I get to bring my dog to work every day which I love, I take him everywhere with me. I can be myself at work which I know most people probably don't have the luxury of doing. I work through my lunch every day which means I spend less time in the office.

**What I have brought to the company**: The girl who did my job before me did a horrible job, she worked here for 3 years and basically fucked everything up. Most customers' names/addresses/phone numbers/emails were in the system wrong (usually misspelled terribly) which made for extreme difficulty pulling up anyone's account. I fixed all of it. Same with our routing system, I fixed all of it. She did not put any taxes in correctly so the accounting side was also all screwed up.

Customer satisfaction rate and job organization/follow-through has increased due to me putting a high priority on communication, replying to customers issues/problems etc. (Before everything basically just got lost in a black hole because I am the most organized one here)

I noticed last year that there was a LOT of a certain inventory we sell walking out the door not being paid for, so I sat down for half a day and compiled all the necessary information required to see how much money we were (potentially) losing, and came up with a game plan to help fix the issue (a referral form that limits who can carry out this inventory, how much a customer is allowed to receive, and it all has to come through me so I can keep track of it).

**Cons**: While our company is growing financially, there is not much room for me to go anywhere (other than what I mention below) until my uncle retires (3-5 years) then my asshole other boss will be taking over and I've already told everyone and myself that I refuse to work for him, and I truly believe the company will go to pot once he takes over because he cares so little about customer service, employees, is constantly condescending, know-it-all, etc.

I am the only woman in the workplace which I do like, but it comes with a bit of sexism as everyone else that works here is a 50+ year old white man with very traditional views on women working.

**Growth Opportunities**: For example, I have asked for over a year to be taught how to do other things such as our financing program, our third party marketing program, take me out to a job so I can see an installation (this would better help me assist customers with questions, plus I just like learning), take me to a sales call (same reasoning). I've also asked to be given a small neighborhood to work evenings and weekends doing sales.

The last time I asked to do sales (for the 4th or 5th time), my uncle went into this long story about how in the 80s when he first started in the industry there was this woman named Ann and she did just as well as everyone else on the team that was a man! ""So women can definitely sell!"" and that was all he said. Kinda pissed me off tbh. I was IN SALES for four years. It's not a question of IF I can do it, it's I need someone to teach me how to do a sales pitch and the in's and out's so I can do it on my own. I'm a fast learner and usually pick things up after one or two times being shown.

The latest thing that angered me was I was told the company goal for this year is to get to a million dollars. To do this, they want me to call EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER (we have thousands) and try to sell them on service. I said something along the lines of ""Are there any spiffs/benefits for appointments I set that follow through?""

The response was an eye roll and ""How about J-O-B SECURITY?""

Feels like a threat to me and I don't do good with that kind of stuff. Esp coming from my asshole other boss, then when I told my uncle he just laughed and said, ""I agree.""

**New Job Offer:** A gutter/hurricane doors/windows, etc company. Been in business for 11 years, and growing steadily, they are getting ready to upgrade to a new facility.

Job Title is ""Production Assistant"" which will be handling job paperwork, dealing directly with installers, some light bookkeeping/accounts receivable/payable etc, possibly answering phones.

M-F 8-4:30 with a 30 minute unpaid lunch break. Work hours are flexible as long as I work 40.

**Pay &amp; Benefits**: $20/hr (I fibbed a bit when I told her how much I was making now, so they think they are matching my pay), 3 month probationary period before any PTO or paid holidays. No health insurance, but she said that is the company's next goal by the end of summer, and also if I remember correctly she also said 401k.

**Vacation/PTO:** 2 weeks paid vacation per year, &amp; paid holidays. Forgot to ask about sick pay.

**Commute:** 3 miles currently, once in new facility maybe 5 miles. 10-15 minutes tops. (Will save me about $100/mo in gas)

**Growth Opportunities:** I was originally interviewing for a bookkeeping position, but in my second interview I was told there was the other position that I may like more (she was correct), so there are multiple roles which I am qualified for and can transfer to/help with if need be.

She also told me that if there are leads that did not lead to installation in the past, that I could make ""cold"" calls to them to follow up and see if they are now interested, and if so, I make commission on those.

**Other benefits:** From my 2 short interviews, it also seems to be a laid back company.

**Cons:** I guess my biggest hesitancy is taking this, hating it, then not being able to go back to my other job. But I don't want to just sit in the familiar and never go anywhere because I'm comfortable either. My uncle is the type of person, once you quit he MIGHT hire you back once, but after that you're DONE done.

Also it probably sounds silly to some of you but I really love how I'm able to bring my dog with me and it makes me sad to think of him home alone all day. But at the same time, I'm close enough to home if I took it that I could go home to visit him on my lunch break if I wanted to.

**Conclusion:**

I feel a bit as if I am taken for granted at my job now, and there is not much room for growth for me at the current company. Is 1.5 years at a company too short to be changing already?

I'm cautiously excited at the opportunity to learn new things, expand my knowledge and skill set, and try something new, but I'm afraid I'm trading in good things that I can't/won't be able to ever get back for ... what? A dollar an hour? Something I don't plan to be doing in 5 years anyway?

I don't know I'm just very conflicted about it and nervous. I have to let her/my boss know this afternoon.

If you made it this far thanks for your attention and input."

I currently work in Atlanta GA and my salary is in the mid 90s.

1672,Talked to like a child..,jobs,"Sometimes I have an interview and it goes like this:

- interviewer is excited to talk to me because my resume is strong 

- I stammer over my words because I am nervous so interviewer looks at me with a very clearly furrowed brow. 

- as the interview picks up, I speak more clearly and smoothly. Interviewer looks very interested and sometimes even impressed  and excited again. 

- we get to the question portion and my questions seem to reinforce to them that I am an idiot. Now they look slightly annoyed.

- at the end of the interview they ask if I have any questions. I usually ask ‚Äúis there anything I can address from our conversation today that concerns you?‚Äù And they start talking to me like I am a child. 

End interview. 

What the heck? I know I have social anxiety. But it‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs like I am not speaking English when I ask my questions. I have always seemed to think wrong or approach things upside down so to speak. It‚Äôs hard to explain but when I get the question portion I really botch it up. What should I do?"
1673,Should I give a two week or four week notice?,jobs,"Hi there. So, I‚Äôve been at my current workplace for about two years now, mostly unhappily, and have decided it‚Äôs finally time for a change.

I‚Äôm grateful for my employer to have ‚Äútaken me in‚Äù as I was a temp and had no relevant experience beforehand, but this is not the career I had ever imagined for myself and I have been unhappy here for a while‚Äîeven though I‚Äôve done my rounds internally (started from the lowest position, moved up, and switched departments).

I‚Äôve decided to start a completely different career path, which I am currently lining up and will be able to start in the beginning of next month (assuming I give two weeks‚Äô notice). However, my next higher up and only other person beside the ones who are over-qualified to do what we do, will be out of office for two weeks starting the week after. With no one below me or alongside me in our department to fill my role, they would be seriously understaffed for one week and essentially have no staff for two more afterwards.

So‚Ä¶do I A) suck it up, continue in my position I dislike, prolong my new career change that I‚Äôm excited for, and stay an extra two weeks in the hope they can find someone?

Or, do I B) owe it only to myself, give them the standard two weeks, and start my exciting new career even though this would probably cause them a lot of grief?

1674,Should I be wary of this job application?,jobs,"Hey all,

Posted in careers advice but thought I'd try here too.

I recently had a company reach out with a grad scheme role via linkedin and after looking up the company, gov registration, employees, etc it seems pretty legit.  My scepticism comes from the fact that it's a role related to hedge funds (i'm not v qualified for that), the salary is **very** high, and the application process has been really quick so far e.g. sent in my cv and an application form and then literally straight away had an invite for the next stage of a telephone interview (which i passed an am now onto an interview stage).

I'm a firm believer that if it seems too good to be true then it probably is so i'm a bit sceptical. Am I being paranoid for no reason or is this a little too good to be true."
1675,Do employment records and length of time working somewhere really even matter if employers don't care about employees anyways?,jobs,"Im finding more and more in real life and threw anti work, jobs and other forums that honestly employers don't give a crap about any of us anyway,

 they can fire us anytime, any reason, and yet we're supposed to give notice when we leave, they offer crappy wages, delusional bosses and yet we have to spend months, years and literally a 1000 job applications, stupid assessments, zoom interviews to land anything. 

Makes me wonder whats the point of staying really at any job no matter how short is because in the end we're nothing but disposable peasants. 

I'm sure HR, recruiters, others will chime in saying job hopping alot is bad, but honestly as companies discriminate, on age, credit, records, backgrounds, damn near anything and everything.

1679,"Current job (7mos) is being bought out. Looking for new job, but worried about what prior employer (7yrs) will say if contacted",jobs,"Apologies for formatting, on mobile. I changed jobs/careers in June 2021. Prior to that, I had been at the same job with the same boss (who also owned the company) for nearly 7 years. When I left, I gave nearly 3 weeks notice. While my old boss didn‚Äôt seem happy about my departure, I didn‚Äôt think it was completely unexpected given our discussions regarding my work output, my pay not reflecting such, lack of advancement, and the toxicity of the workplace.

After I started at my present company, I was informed by a prior coworker and a prior client that after I had left that my old boss was telling clients (and possibly other professionals in other companies we worked with, though I have not had anyone directly confirm) I had been fired for performance reasons. While it made me upset, I did not plan to change jobs anytime soon and I was already working in my new position, so I let it go.

Now, my current job is being taken over by a new company. If everything was equivalent it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, but their benefits are worse and more costly (2.5 to 5x more expensive) and other perks and additional compensation have been eliminated. As such, I‚Äôve been looking for a new job (as are a number of others, some one which have already turned in notice). My office manager and my direct boss  and I have had number of talks regarding my concerns with the new company and told me they both are happy to have me use them as references.

So now I have a very short history in my current job/field, and a long history in my prior field. I‚Äôve been applying to both just to spread my net a bit wider. However, my old job is the majority of my work history. I‚Äôm not using my old boss as a reference, but I‚Äôm still very concerned that if he gets a call to check my employment history he may say something (or imply) negative things or outright lie given he has already lied to others regarding me resigning. Should I disclose that my prior employer didn‚Äôt take my departure well in interviews? I‚Äôm not really sure what to do"

They still retracted the offer. I had 5 other interviews in the pipeline which I cancelled when I was offered this role. I know I should have been transparent from the beginning but it sucks as this was a great opportunity for me. I'm exhausted with the whole interview process and it was draining and finally when I thought I caught a break, shit like this happens. Please give me your honest thoughts on this. Thanks!

I'm dealing with a coworker with about a year or so more experience than me (both of us under 5 years exp) who I've been tied to due to workload.

He's openly talked to me about all the ways to climb the corporate ladder, how to do it, who to be around, extra work to pick up. The guy is clearly motivated to just move up.

He's been throwing mundane work my way to fill up time, being the middle man between the project manager and myself due to familiarity, and the previous person who worked for him left before I joined. I'll get forwarded emails that were tasked to him. His way of explaining things is to spam me with links to 15+ folders for only a couple tasks.

He self taught himself all the design in the project so it's honestly a mess and difficult to fully understand. The project itself is pretty far outside my experience so I'm forced to rely on this guy for critical details.

It's obvious why I'm doing work for this guy, but how should I navigate this? This is the type of guy that would never let you navigate around him and I'm worried I'll be stuck with this guy for a year plus before I can truly pull away.

Permanent Part Time
Starting wage $18.15 (0.15 raise but now paying union dues of $54 monthly)
No guaranteed hours as part time employees.
No benefits as part time.
No no pension as part time.

I‚Äôve been the district manager for 3 years, and worked for the company for 5 years prior. I‚Äôm 25. I have no degree. 

I am leaving in the next year or so. I‚Äôm incredibly burnt out, and not sure where to go from here. Out of all of the responsibilities of my job, I hate managing people the most. I‚Äôm good at the base job- selling what we sell, communicating with customers, running a store. I really enjoy writing procedures, creating positions, optimizing efficiency- that type of stuff. I just don‚Äôt want to have to go through and enforce things and follow up with people who don‚Äôt want change. We are a franchise, but I only have so much control, as corporate checks in regularly to make sure we do things the way they want it done. The people I manage are all 17-25. I spend a lot of time acting as a liaison between corporate, the owner, and the employees who all want different things. No matter what I do, I‚Äôm the bad guy. I pay people the most that I am allowed to pay them- it‚Äôs not enough. As far as covid goes, we follow the most recent cdc guidelines and I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm an idiot for that amongst the employees too. Corporate sets a rule, im the Asshole. 

I‚Äôm not dead against management, I used to really enjoy it. I‚Äôm looking to move on to something that I qualify for, but I don‚Äôt want to find myself in the same position of being the person everyone can blame but not actually having any real power. I‚Äôm even okay with being the bad guy, but only if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm making real change for the better. Not because I‚Äôm doing something that some out of touch person across the country deems necessary . 
I also recognize that I might have a far different experience running a team with adults and not teenagers and college students where this is their first job. At the same time, I‚Äôm only 25, not college educated, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm qualified to run a team of people who actually have their shit together. 


Anyone have any career ideas? I‚Äôm open to most things, including going back to school for a bit."

1709,Contacting the person you would report to directly?,jobs,"I have been applying to jobs and it seems to continually be going nowhere after the screening interview. I have reached out to a few of the hr staff I screened with as the conversations are always great from my perspective - mostly a basic checklist of do you have xyz designations, have you managed teams on xyz types of projects, etc, etc which are all yes. The few that replied said that I was great, blah, blah but the consistent theme has been there were ""more qualified candidates"". So I went to Linkedin to find out who got the jobs from a few months ago and well.. yes they were considerably OLDER but in many cases their experience didn't even look as closely aligned to the roles as mine.

For context I've been in my current role for 6 years with 10 years total experience (I'm only 33). I was the youngest ever promoted to this position and am still younger now than any previous person in the role - there are four of us with my title and the other 3 are late 40s early 50s. Obviously my org had the benefit of seeing my work as an internal applicant and when they were hiring I requested a meeting with the CEO to sell myself as I didn't meet the years required to apply.

Six years later and I'm bored and stuck - I'm in a position where even a lateral move would exclude me based on the job descriptions I'm reading and it's driving me crazy that I can't even get to the real interview stage to show at least a piece of what I can do. 

I'm considering sending a few direct messages on Linkedin to the VPs of the area I'm applying to. The tone would be along the lines of ""Hi, I have applied to a few positions with your group and would like to introduce myself and why I think I would be a great fit and asset to our team. Few key bullets. Wrap up with I will continue to watch for new positions and hope to speak with you in the future."" NOT asking to be reconsidered for things I've already applied for. 

Is this a bad idea?"

1711,Should I drop a minor I don't care about? Would this hurt me in future job hunts?,jobs,"I am a college senior expected to graduate this May with 3 majors and 2 minors. The whole thing took only 4 years because when everything shifted online in March 2020, I kept taking the max number of credits my school allotted. I couldn't graduate early due to pre-requistes, so I decided to take the excess of courses in an area I was profitably interested in (Molecular Genetics). 

In the process of this, I ended up very close to finishing a minor in Sustainable Agriculture so I decided to sign up for it. I thought it would teach me the scientific principles behind sustainable innovations in agriculture. 

I am 3 credits away (capstone) from finishing the minor. I have absolutely hated it so far because all it has been about is how farms make people feel good and how some communities don't have food. I get that these are important issues, but I am a scientist at heart and I don't really have any input on how to fix any of these issues. I often omit that I have the minor because I can't talk about it at all. 

Ex: I got a 65% on our video final exam for talking about how irresponsible agricultural practices lead to dead zones in lakes. The primary comment was this is a class about social issues. 

I have already applied to an MS program in Food Science with an emphasis on Genomics. Would dropping this minor be unwise for that or the job field?"

1713,Co-worker of mine gave his 2 week notice today and it‚Äôs making me have second thoughts with regards to my job as well,jobs,"For context, he‚Äôs actually subordinate of mine. Great guy and great worker but there wasn‚Äôt much room for advancement for him so I going to stop him from bettering himself. 

That being said, I‚Äôve had some thoughts over the last few years of trying to get out of this industry (HVAC supply house). I‚Äôve been in this since I was in high school, went to college and got a degree in criminal justice but I flipped on getting into law enforcement so this became my career. I moved up to the point of being a manager by the time I was 24 so it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve taken to quite well. 

Now I‚Äôm 29 and I really just don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. In my position you get hit from the customers across the counter, the workers below you, and upper management above you. There‚Äôs stress with every job but I really just want something where I‚Äôm not getting hit from every direction. If I get hit from the people above me because I have tasks to complete then that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs gotten tiring hearing something from everyone and wearing a million hats. Plus a lot of the people in the trade in my area don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing anymore so it makes the job even more frustrating trying to literally do their job for them. 

The one thing that keeps me here is the paycheck. In 2021 I made $98k, the most I‚Äôve made in my life and I have the potential cross that 6 figure mark this year. But I‚Äôve had times over the last few years where I go home in a mood because of how frustrating it is and I‚Äôll be short with people around me. Then I‚Äôm just perpetually mad because something happening the next day sets me off too. I know people with less stressful jobs and they still make solid money. Because of that, I‚Äôve pondered if the money is worth the stress. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? 

Sorry for this long rant. It‚Äôs been pent up for awhile and it was nice to get this out. Any input would be appreciated."

I also keep feeling like a hinderance to my coworkers when I get stuck on a phone call because I don‚Äôt know what to do. The office is crazy busy, and it‚Äôs not like theres always someone to help me out. Yesterday I took my first few calls, and I definitely got lost on what to do. Medications, refills, returning phone calls, dealing with referrals/insurance, are all new to me. Any advice..?"
1715,My boss is angry at me and won't give me any feedback. Should I say something or just leave without saying anything?,jobs,"Hey all, I could really use your help on this, I have no idea what to do. I work remotely as a contractor. At this company, there are projects we work on, and then the project manager will either assign us to new projects or put us back in the pool of contractors where we wait to be assigned to other projects. 

I've worked for one manager for about a year. I've been a hard worker and he recognized that and continued assigning me to projects. He also told me that he would have me work under a senior editor who would train me for a permanent position at this company. I've been doing that for a few months. 

But after only 3 weeks into my most current project, the senior editor suddenly told me that I would not be working on this new project anymore. Then a few days later, I was told that I would not be working on any project at all (I would be going back into the pool of contractors). (I'm sure they discussed these decisions, but my manager is the main decider). 

Because I work remotely, I can only email him to ask what happened, but he didn't reply to my email at all.

I can think of a couple things that potentially impacted this. My work performance was a bit below my usual quality because I was dealing with a family situation (though still definitely up to the company's standards). Also, I forgot to send my manager a happy holidays email due to being really busy with work that day.

But do these things justify the really rude way that he dismissed me after a year of working for him, not giving me any feedback at all about why he was suddenly taking me off the training and even regular work, and not replying to my emails?

Do you think I should email him one last time to express my thoughts? Obviously with the rude way that he and the senior editor dismissed me, there's no way they would ever have me work with them again, so I'm not trying to convince him. But I think this is unfair and I have no idea what even happened and I want to tell him that. I feel like just leaving without saying anything at all would be weird too (like I know what I did wrong and I accept it, when I don't at all). 

What do you all think I should do in this situation, should I send him an email? Would really appreciate your advice."

1742,Technical Worker Local Tours App - UBER for Traveling,jobs,"Hi I am Davide De Blasio, and I am the Co-Founder of ""hobo.""

This is a resume of the pitch, if you want I can send you full pitch (PDF) or jump in a call.

We already have an ALPHA. (hoboaccess.com)

""hobo."" is a quick and mobile-friendly local tours application.

**VISION**

We want to change the way people get new experiences while traveling.

We have the new way people look for local personalized tours, and the way local guides or anyone who has a unique experience offers them.

Making this process fast, easy, exciting and move it online.

We want to eliminate intermediaries in tour booking. We want to make customization and booking of tours simple, fast and cheap. Giving the possibility to anyone who knows a place in depth to be able to create tours and earn extra money, at the same time giving the user the opportunity to earn through the social integrated into the application, through the published posts.

**WHY**

People today book tours through:

1. tourist agencies (offline - 83% market share): high costs, non-customizable tours and often not carried out by local people.
2. online app: little customizable tours, not anyone can operate as a tour guide but you must be accepted. The applications are not mobile-friendly and are often used only at the time of research and do not have a high retention.

Finding a tailor-made tour for us is not easy, with ""hobo."" you individually choose the activities to do and who will be your ""Virgil"".

Our competitor in the tour industry is GetYourGuide, which offers great solutions, but only from the perspective of the tour taker.

It does not grant the freedom to anyone to be able to sign up as a tour guide.

Airbnb experience is our competitor from an ""experience"" point of view.

It mainly offers experiences within the application, which is therefore not ideal for those who want to tour, this slows down the search.

Both if they integrated what is at the base of hobo they would be 100% competitors.

""hobo."" is born as a mobile application, and this is one of the strong points compared to other applications, using fast services and quick searches allows you to book or create a tour in seconds.

""hobo."" will act as a marketplace where guides and tourists meet and will take a 10% commission on each transaction.

**ABOUT YOU**

We are looking for a worker who wants to undertake this project with us, combining our ideas. We already developed front end, we need only to develop backend. The project is highly scalable and in a short time, especially considering the end of the pandemic and the travel boom. Also with ""hobo."" we offer the possibility of earning both the user and the driver, allowing both to obtain advantages. We do not require specific skills, but we need him to be able to develop the app and the website, send previous projects and Linkedin profile privately. My current partner and I are also experts in programming, Flutter and Dart to be exact, so you won't be alone."

I was wondering if anyone here had some advice, as a more experienced translator probably, on how a young freelance translator could go about finding new clients?

Maybe websites with job posts or content ideas to publish on social networks.

I have a website as well as company pages on social networks but I have no idea what to post on those and it's usually down the priority list because I'm simply translating and actually making money.

But recently, one of my client has been a bit dry in terms of work and I think I need to start looking for new clients just in case.

Any advice from other translators or similar self-employed jobs on where and how to get in touch with people would be helpful.

Now I know what you're thinking ""this girl is an idiot"".  Don't worry, I know. I already know that 2 weeks notice has completely gone out the window. I'm not going back, but I want to actually quit rather than like just stop showing up.

I worked at a fast food restaurant that did not pay me enough even though I was definitely the hardest worker in my age group (and that was the majority of people considering it was a very popular first job). The whole reason I stopped showing up is because I was working way harder than I was getting paid for.

1751,How do I ask my supervisor if I can work remotely due to COVID?,jobs,"To start off with some background information, I recently started this position at the beginning of December but I have been able to impress my Supervisor and peers with my work ethic and efficiency so far. I am not sure if this means anything but during the interview, I asked if there was an opportunity to work remotely and I mentioned my parents' high risk regarding COVID (advanced age, chronic illnesses) but at the time they said this position is for office. I do have a work laptop and work phone and my Supervisor has mentioned several time in passing that people have been able to work remotely with it. He also occasionally works remotely as well. The job I am currently doing is perfectly capable of being done remotely as I complete all my tasks on my work laptop. I am currently on my 90-day probationary period, and 1 month into my new job.  


When I got into work today, I received an e-mail from my supervisor that someone in our department contracted COVID and if I had any concerns about the protocols, I should address them with HR. My question is that I want to ask him tomorrow if I could work remotely. How should I go about asking if at all? What I have come up with so far is:  


""Hey John Doe, about the email that you sent out yesterday regarding someone in our department contracting COVID. I live with my parents who are part of the high-risk population. I was wondering if there are any options available for me that could help me minimize the risk of my parents contracting COVID such as remote work?  


TL;DR: Someone at my workplace got COVID and I'm worried that I could get it and spread it to my parents who are high-risk. I want to know if asking to work remotely would reflect badly on me and if I were to ask, how should I go about asking my Supervisor?"

What I‚Äôm worried about is I have a 12 week trial, in my country (UK) the majority of jobs (especially grad jobs) have this. My manager said if I work hard I should pass it, I can tell they put a lot of time and effort into finding someone to hire so I know they wouldn‚Äôt let go of me easily regarding the trial. I was thinking I could update it to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äòcontract‚Äô job and then change it to permanent once I pass the trial. My friends who were on trials posted about their new jobs the first day, so im thinking of doing the same. I know people in general say to wait a few months in case you hate it but even if I did I‚Äôd be unlikely to leave it as it‚Äôs so hard getting a job in my field with less than a year‚Äôs experience.

Recently, I found some contaminated tools we use which seemed to have been used all day until I pointed it out, prepped some food with it before catching the contaminants, reported this to the manager but said I did not need to redo the prepped food. Which shocked the hell out me because
I have worked in quality control, and in that job I would advice other workers what is okay and what isn‚Äôt.

Anyway, I ignored his request because he is confrontational and would have berated me and given an illogical justification about how his drive thru timer is more important than customer‚Äôs health, he‚Äôs just so very inaccessible.

I never had a problem with these type of things with the other managers, a lot of them agree whenever I point out anything to be fixed. But he started telling me how, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all child‚Äôs play and how the other people are working hard and how is it fair that I am doing this child‚Äôs play‚Äù when I told him I was already redoing the prepped food, which tbh I don‚Äôt care about his timer because people‚Äôs health is far more important than his bullshit drive thru timer competition.

He berates anyone who messes with his drive thru timer time, I‚Äôm not the only one he acts aggressive and tells you off to. Should he be reported?"

1769,Struggling with References,jobs,"so i've been working on an application with americorps, but apparently i need 2 references. i can't think of any to ask for a letter of recommendation.

from what i've heard and seen, family and friend references are strongly discouraged, so that's not an option. i'm in college, but for the last 2 years i've been stuck in online classes where the professors and students are hardly engaged with one another, meaning i don't have a connection that i could ask a reference from. the professors that i *have* had a connection with have just completely flown off the radar and i seriously can't find them anywhere :( for this quarter (winter) i'm taking a break to focus on a coursera certificate class, but there aren't any teachers supervising the course that i could connect with.

my only other thought is my therapist from a year ago, but from what i've read, it's not recommended to have a therapist as a reference. even if i tried to, i don't think i'd be able to do that because i can't seem to find her anywhere online.

i know some people have recommended getting a job to get references, but that's the whole point of needing references in the first place. i need references to get a job but i need a job to get references. augh!

others have recommended volunteering and connecting with volunteer staff to get a reference, but it feels so unbelievably awkward to volunteer just to get a reference as fast as possible. especially when the volunteer opportunities near me are group-based and are more about just getting the goal finished than learning names and personal interaction.

i'm probably complaining too much or trying to find ways to complain that don't exist. in any case i'm just struggling to figure out references, and i'm in a bit of a rush because there's a really great job opportunity i could fulfill perfectly at my college, but i'm scared it will be filled soon and i don't have any references to get my application finished in time. i have plenty of skills but no references to verify all this.

A little background, I've decided to work with a Staffing Agency that specializes in placing people in the Admin workspace (Admin, Executive, Accounting assistant, etc) they recently brought forward a client of theres that they felt would be a good fit for me that needed an Accounting assistant which is what my current position is. 

I thought great, let me have a chat with them. I had a wonderful conversation with their HR Director and Senior Accounting Manager. The salary is well within my expectations, theres a commute, but I'd only need to do it once a week, and its conveniently near transit stations that I can easily opt for the Train if I decide I'd rather not drive, but for some reason I feel it'd be a lateral move on my part if I pursue it any further.

I must say that this is exclusively my own suspicion, and my evidence is anecdotal at best. However, it seems to me that, these days, even high positions inside a company (managers, directors) are staying at a job for 1-2yrs and then jump ship.

I heard this was already the case for the CxO suite, which are replaced semi-regularly if they are not producing results, but in my experience the levels below these was were you find the 10-15yrs at the company, started at the bottom type of people.

In my network (mostly engineers and engineering related), a lot of the older people I've met have started their careers at a company, staid for a long time and seemingly in the last 4-5yrs are swapping jobs with regularity. Like, if you look at their CV/LinkedIn, you'll see a 10yr stint at a company and the last 2-3 positions have lasted for little more than a year, often only months.

And they seem to be making upgrades or side grades, not downgrading their tittle.

Are you seeing the same thing as me?

Is this due to shitty work environments for people high in the totem pole? Job stress? Insufficient compensation?

1776,I found a job in an unorthodox way and it renewed my confidence!,jobs,"Every title I tried made it sound like I joined an MLM scheme, and I did not, I swear. Lol.

I'm a stay at home mom currently, really suffering with feeling isolated, PPD, and just not having enough adult interaction. When I quit my job to stay home with my daughter, our income went down by $2400/month, and now we're living paycheck to paycheck, rather than *comfortably.* It's all a means to an end and temporary, but I really wanted to help boost our finances a bit.

I needed something flexible, since we can't afford childcare. I had to be able to take my daughter with me or work from home. I wanted part time work, and I wanted to get paid at least as much as I used to make ($13/hr). I know, BIG ask. I moved to a new town at the beginning of the pandemic, so I had no connections or leads. I couldn't find any jobs on the internet that would work for me, but I was willing to do anything as long as it fit those criteria.

I was bored a few nights ago, so I just got on the Nextdoor app and posted a bit about myself, my degree, work experience, background, and that I was willing to babysit, do some housekeeping, run errands. I said I just wanted to meet more people in the community and make a little extra money. I also mentioned that if anyone needed help and couldn't pay, I would share my time as much as I could - good company is as refreshing to a SAHM as money! I should mention that I'm not overly skilled or experienced in anything. I have a degree in child development, I worked at a research preschool for a year, but I was a supervisor at a restaurant for 5 years before I left to be a stay at home mom. To me, this didn't seem all that impressive. At the very most, I was expecting maybe a couple low-paying offers to clean houses or babysit for date night. At worst, I figured a few people would ask me to help out for free, and I'd do it just to be around someone that knew how to talk. Lol.

I got over 70 replies! People were offering to connect me to the director of their churches and preschools, got lots of full time cleaning gig and nanny offers. I had a couple people tell me I sounded like a great fit for jobs they were hiring for. I had a few people ask to get coffee just because I seemed like someone they'd want to be friends with! I actually didn't have a single person ask me to work for free - everyone offered to pay. I had so many offers, I actually found two jobs that fit my needs, and I got both of them!

One is cleaning for a lady who had back surgeries and just needed help getting her house in order, and one is babysitting for a family, 8 hours a day, 3 days a week, while mom is at work. I can bring my daughter to both, and they both pay $15/hr!

Obviously these aren't my forever jobs, but they work perfectly for me right now,  and I am happy to have the references for when I DO try to get back to a normal job. I am so excited! This all really renewed my confidence in myself as a desirable employee. It also made me realize that if I put myself out there in a genuine way, people will want to hire me. Just some food for thought for anyone looking for a job right now: Put yourself out there and be your genuine self. It might land you something perfect."

1783,"I get chastised at work for using ""big words""",jobs,"I work in the court system and most of my work consists of communicating with delinquent juveniles and their families. I've had instances where my supervisor or trainer observed a meeting I conducted with families where I supposedly used words that were too big. Both times they've pulled me to the side to provide me with ""constructive criticism"" on how not to use big words when speaking with our juveniles and their families. They have also reminded me about using big words when I'm *solely* speaking with them...

An incident happened a few weeks ago where I was explaining to my supervisor why scheduling an appointment for a client was not successful. I said, ‚ÄúI tried to call the agency on the dad‚Äôs behalf but he protested lol‚Äù (dad was very adamant about NOT setting up the appointment right then despite my many attempts at convincing him and I was trying to convey that to her).

And she said, ‚ÄúProtested? What do you mean? What are you saying?‚Äù and seemed very upset by my choice of words.

Today I expressed a concern to my her about something and I, *very respectfully*, said that I feel as though some of the expectations being placed on me were ""arbitrary"". Her facial expression became a bit dazed and she said ""arbitrary?"". And I said, ""yeah, like-"" and she immediately interrupted to very sternly say that I don't need to give her definitions or explain words to her. We went back to discussing the issue and I guess I continued to use big words and she interrupted me again to say, ""you don't have to prove how smart you are to me"".

Honestly, I'm confused because I feel like I use words that anyone with at least a 12th grade education would know with my her and my colleagues. However, when I'm speaking with my juveniles, I always make sure to use ""smaller"" words but if I mess up and use a big word, I always follow it up with additional, smaller words to add context. I've had moments where my juveniles have said big words *back* to me that I said earlier on in the conversation. And I have never had anyone stop and say, ""what?"" In a more recent occurrence, I had a juvenile use a super huge word to respond to a question I asked that had a semi-big word and in it. It was as if my use of the word made him more comfortable to speak freely; or made him feel as though he could *finally* speak and be understood in a way in which was more natural for him. And I felt that. 

My trainer and supervisor work closely together and find pleasure in holding sporadic, 4-hour long meetings on things like this and it also stumps my productivity. 

I don't use those words because I want to come off as smart or pretentious. I use those words because it's the only way I know how to speak without stuttering, saying ""uhhh"", or having to think of multiple words to express my sentiments as opposed to just saying one word that literally encompasses it all.

TLDR: I get in trouble at work for using big words to my supervisor. Today I was told that I don't need to prove my intelligence when speaking to my supervisor."
1784,I've finally found a job after a bit over an year of trying.,jobs,"I decided to only write this a few days after I got the offer &amp; other stuff that would indeed tell me I got the job for real (signing offer letter, an NDA, and sending out the documents for the legal paperwork the company has to do with me). It's a WFH position, i'll get 25% more of what I earn now, plus benefits: food card, health plan... Things I never had (i'm 23 years old as of now), i'll experience. And it's a multinational company. Not a bad start to my career, to be honest. So far i've been well treated and I was recruited in the final phases by the global head of operations, and she liked me, so, i'm quite happy with my own performance.

What I want to say is that, don't give up. If you won't follow any other advice, follow that one. Don't give up. You only need one 'yes', and it can come from anywhere. You don't know where it could be. Do your research, your method of applying - spray and pray or localized. I've done both; at times applying to certain industries only because the jobs being posted weren't in my area, and applying more when more jobs were being posted that I could fill in for. In the end, 'spray and pray' worked for me. but, your story can and will be different than my story.

I want to thank this subreddit and most specially the community at the Discord server. They're a very valuable asset for you that's looking for a new job. It may take you less or more time than me to get a new job. But you will. And you'll see how good it is, how awesome it was, to get something through your effort and no one else's. You can do it.

1785,Think I blew it,jobs,"Been with a company for 1 year and 4 months. Was hired as a case manager. In the job ad, it said something to the effect that there was a large opportunity for advancement as the organization is growing. I like the agency a lot, but I am ready to be done with case management. 

After about 6 months on the job, I started to study to take the exam to be licensed to do counseling. I let me boss know that I was doing so, and that I was hoping to move out of case management because I wasn‚Äôt enjoying it anymore. He said a lot of things about how they‚Äôd really like to keep me so let him know what I would need. He said that a few times in fact. I had many conversations over the ensuing months about wanting to move on from the role. I got licensed for counseling in November, and told my boss I‚Äôd like to be fully done with case management within 6 months, and that I continued to be unhappy in the role, which was starting to effect me (mistake 1).

I have gotten more firm about my need for a plan to move on and began asking to put a plan in place to make it happen, because otherwise I‚Äôd need to look elsewhere (mistake 2). I have been really transparent because I care about my job and my clients and don‚Äôt want to leave anyone hanging. 

I suggested other things I could do to assist the agency, like seek out and train a replacement for my role or other tasks needed by the agency, so that I could at least start doing some new tasks. I have experience recruiting, hiring and training. It all came to a head today, in a meeting with my supervisor and the owner. On the one hand, they said that they thought I could transition in 4-6 months, they also made some of the following statements:

1. That they didn‚Äôt have work for me as a counselor because they just hired someone new for counseling and changed another counselor‚Äôs schedule so they could do more appointments. According to them, I am ‚Äúasking to do someone else‚Äôs job‚Äù (even though I‚Äôve been asking and trying to plan getting into that sort of work for awhile, but they chose to make those staffing changes anyway)
2. They hired me as a case manager so they are effectively shutting down their case management program for me to transition (even though what would really shut it down would be if I just left)
3. My supervisor told me he doesn‚Äôt think the 4-6 month timeline ‚Äúis enough for me‚Äù (essentially saying he thinks I should just jump ship I guess?)
4. That them making time to meet with me today reflected that they want to work things out with me (even though it was during an already scheduled time with my supervisor)

I told them all of that made me feel pretty guilty (which I‚Äôve already been struggling with) and they were shocked that I‚Äôd have that reaction. I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. Is that reaction bizarre given all of this context?

My appointment attendance is often the highest in the agency, often rivaling the doctors who prescribe suboxone. I work hard and have been told by literally every person who works there something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the best case manager I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù I‚Äôm more than qualified to start counseling, based on 5 years of experience in the field. Clients don‚Äôt even always know the difference between a counselor and a case manager. They will talk to me about the same things as they do with their counselor and I‚Äôve always been ready to jump in. In group meetings, I feel that my assessments of clients progress are often more accurate than their counselors when I reflect back after a few months of watching a particular client. I just don‚Äôt get it and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm working myself out of a job and/or there won‚Äôt be anything at the end of this tunnel."

Just for being on call and available. And also if we needed to come in, we would be paid 5 hours overtime minimum. He also told us both that every time our phones rang between 11 PM and 6 AM, we would be paid an additional hour each time. The 3rd mechanic has been there for 26 years. Today, as I was putting in for 69 hours of overtime, My manager (who originally told us the on call policy of 1 hour per call between 11-6) started 2nd guessing himself and asked the senior mechanic. He said that policy is incorrect and we are only to get paid one hour. No matter how many times the phone rings. Unless we need to go in. I think this is wrong. I like the job. I like my manager. He took a chance and hired me out of a contractor position despite me being under qualified. I have since been thriving. So it‚Äôs worked out for both of us thus far.

I haven't applied anywhere else recently, since I've really had my heart set on this job. 

My dad died very unexpectedly this weekend, and I am together with my family and it has of course been a shock.

The company is looking to make the decision between me and one or two other candidates soon, and this final interview is very important. Earlier, I was fairly confident that I was the best candidate and could do well in the interview to get the offer. However, now I am not sure whether or not I could get through the interview without crying, if they ask me how my 2022 has been, or whether I would be in an emotional place to convey enthusiasm for the role. I might be able to interview just fine, but I can't know for sure.

The job would only start late February, so I believe I would be in a place where I could start the job by then. I am staying with my mom the month of January to give her support so she's not alone in the house.

However, I am wondering if I should inform them in advance of the interview that my father died. If I am emotionally off during the interview, I wouldn't want them to discount me because of that. At the same time, because it is a very demanding position, I am afraid if telling them I am in a vulnerable place will mean they discount me immediately, and I lose my chance.

They want to make the hiring decision soon, so asking to postpone the interview would also be risky.

Hope y'all are doing well. I am a 30 yr old guy, first generation immigrant living in a big metropolitan city. I graduated college while working full time and I landed a job related to my field as a Financial analyst. I really like my job and my coworkers but I am eager to learn more and more everyday that goes by. I am really interested in switching into bank investments, because of the high salaries and bonuses but also because I've heard that you get to travel a lot as well.

1810,Need advice on how to maintain professionalism when extremely frustrated‚Ä¶,jobs,"Hey everyone! A little background on the situation: I am a nursing student, and had previously worked for a part time very popular cake place. I applied for this job (detox and recovery center) on the First of December, and was called for a phone interview within 2 days of applying. (Went very well, they loved me and I was more then experienced enough for the position, and met all requirements but the age) I was not 21 at the time (which is required by law but I had not known that) and they told me they would contact me when I had turned 21. 

Fast forward to December 15th (21st birthday) and I got an email about an interview on the 18th. Had a great interview, they told me I was hired and they would be in touch very soon. 10 days later, I received a call offering me much more than my previous job, and inviting me to join said company. I was thrilled, as this is within my nursing career field more than a cake shop is..

Obviously said yes, and was sent over paperwork (at 9 pm that night) to fill including a background check and drug test. Sent back all paperwork same day and got drug tested early the next day. I was told in the interview that this paperwork only took 24-72 hours to be completed and done including drug test and background check. Now for reference were sitting at December 29th. 

As of now, January 10th, I have emailed and emailed about updates and whatnot and haven‚Äôt gotten responses. I got my first one in 12 days yesterday, saying how I had 3 pending things and we would talk tomorrow (now today) Still have yet to receive an email. I even messaged today saying I was free all day and they could even give me a call. 

Understandably I am super frustrated with the whole process, and I really want to work for them! What am I doing wrong here? Why is this taking so long? As a newly 21yr old female, I am just dipping my toes into a professional work place, and I feel like I‚Äôve done everything in my power to get this job started. I will post the email I am about to send, but PLEASE if anyone has any advice for me or what I should be doing feel free to let me know. I‚Äôm so sorry this is a lengthy post!

Email:

I apologize for all of the emails I have sent- but I have been waiting for responses since December 20th or so to get things started. I am really trying to get this process going, as I am eager to start this new experience as well as having bills to pay. You mentioned yesterday about having things you still needed from me and I have yet to hear from you about that, and just wanted to check in."
1811,Work from home jobs‚Ä¶,jobs,"I‚Äôm hoping that some of you wonderful Redditors will be able to provide suggestions or recommendations for WFH jobs that I could qualify for that might be a fit.

1813,"Destroyed my life, got it back, now what?",jobs,"Background: 25m. Dealt with Major Depression, ADHD and severe addiction to drugs/alcohol from 16-24, managed to mostly get my shit together (still need a car and a job), now coming up on a year sober! I'm on medication that works for me, I see a psychiatrist and therapist regularly, and mental health is my number one priority now. Bonus - I managed to get out of that lifestyle with zero criminal record, and I never got anyone pregnant. I'm also financially independent (outside of health insurance; still on my father's plan until my 26th birthday this summer) and am renting an apartment with my younger sibling.

Work History: This is where it gets ugly... Dates are approximate - I was under the influence of something almost 24/7 for 8 years so my memory of that time is extremely fuzzy sadly. My work history begins in the Midwest. First job was at a chipotle type place at 18 years old. I think I made it a month or two before quitting. Then I worked several different positions at a grocery store, and left after 5 months. After that I worked in different front of house positions at an upper-middle tier non-chain restaurant, eventually ending up as a server/waiter. This is the job I stayed at the longest - I know I worked there for at least a full year but beyond that I have no clue exactly how many months it was total. After that I moved in with my father on the west coast and begin working as a server at an independent restaurant that went under literally 2 weeks after hiring me. After that I continued serving at a different restaurant for several months (not sure exactly) until I impulsively moved in with an ex-friend in a different city (same west coast state). I couldn't get another server job in enough time so I started working at Starbucks. Eventually my mental health issues got extremely bad and I was asked by my roommate to move out (I wasn't on the lease). I want to say I was there for 3 months but again, not sure. Moved back in with father and continued working at a local Starbucks. My guess is I was there about 5 or 6 months. Then he kicked me out due to my addictions and I was forced to move back in with family in the Midwest. I spent several months there unemployed, trying to get sober. Eventually got a job at the local grocery store deli, relapsed and quit. Was probably 2-3 months, not sure. Cue several more months of unemployment, then got a pizza delivery job in either September or October 2020. Worked there until the end of May 2021. So 6-7 months. Saved all my money and moved back to the west coast June 2021, got an apartment with my sibling, I'm paying $600/month in rent and around $100/month in utilities/other bills. First job was in a bar's kitchen, left after a week because it was a total nightmare job and extremely underpaid (even boss said he can't blame me). Next I got a serving job at an upscale restaurant. Mental issues got bad again and I quit the job and was hospitalized. Finally, I got a connection through family and got hired at a bodyshop/collision center in the parts department. The environment was incredibly toxic and my supervisor had similar severe issues that made every morning a struggle of panic attacks etc. After two months I took a leave of absence to complete an intensive outpatient program (daily therapy basically) because although I was sober at this point, I could tell the job was causing me to spiral again. Several weeks go by, program is changing my life, but my leave of absence was up and they needed me back. But I still had 3 weeks left to complete in the program, and to top it off I was told my supervisor had quit for similar reasons and I was being promoted to a manager position (with a dollar/hr raise) when I return. My supervisor had her struggles but she was the only ""friend"" I had there and the only person I connected with and that wasn't mean/toxic, so the idea of doing 5x the work I was already doing, going into a now 100 percent toxic culture, and once again not prioritizing my mental health all for an extra dollar an hour didn't make sense to me. So I quit at the end of November and completed the program, and I'm doing better than ever! But now I'm unemployed. I don't own a car. I paid December's rent and bills with savings. I have two grand left so I can do it 2 more times if I absolutely have to but I really want something ASAP so I can get a car sooner and not burn though my savings. 

Not sure if anyone will read that huge wall of text. Hopefully someone will. I just need advice. I want a career in IT. But for right now, I need something to pay the rent while I study for certifications etc. I want to stay out of the restaraunt industry if possible but my work history is so abysmal I don't know if I could get hired anywhere else (don't have any other family connections). I was thinking about working security possibly. A driving/delivery job would be great but I don't have a car. I might be able to negotiate use of my sibling/roomates' but I can‚Äôt count on it.   I can handle a certain degree of stress but my last job took every ounce of attention I had and it caused me to spiral, so I need something slightly more casual. If I could get a WFH customer service rep type job that would be perfect but I have no clue where to start and my work history makes me feel paralyzed? Should I just stretch the dates on my longer-term jobs and omit the other ones so it looks like steady employment? I don‚Äôt think any previous employer has checked my references before but I know it happens, especially outside of restaraunts. Has anybody here ever been in a similar situation? How did you get out of it? What did you  do? I have great people skills and I‚Äôm good at interviews; the problem is just getting them. 

TL;DR: Mental illness/addiction ran my life for almost a decade, recovered but now my resume is fucked. Take a gamble and lie about dates/length of time employed or do something else? Any advice greatly appreciated"
1814,How likely is a employer to call your old jobs? üò¨,jobs,"

Okay I had a job interview today at hooters and I wanted the job sooo bad. So I mentioned past restaurants I have worked for. Maggianos and then a more local restaurant. I normally feel weird bringing up past jobs. not that I did anything bad at them.. but 1. I worked at maggianos when I was literally 16/17 and im 19 now so I personally don't feel as if work I did in literally high school would accurately represent my work or the person I am today but I'm not really that concerned with maggianos... it's the more local restaurant that I'm concerned about.. the manager is a family friend who treated me like absolute shit. I know she Would have no issue throwing me under the bus and bring up my personal buisness. I mean it's nothing to bad.. not like I acted bad at work or killed someone. But I did have times I would call out of work due to mental illness, not constantly.. just one or two times over the span of like 4 months of working for her. I know you might say ""oh she legally can't bring up your personal buisness"" yeah I know, that dosnt stop her. 

She constantly brought up my mental illness and family buisness at work to my coworkers and other managers infront of me. I know she would make me look bad at hooters if it means I will be stuck working for her. The restaurant used to be own by someone else and used to go by a different name so I gave hooters the old name of the restaurant even tho I didn't work there at that time.. I was hoping he would see it was under a new name and not bother calling. What do you think? Is it likely he would even call at all? 

I really just want a fresh start, a job that no one knows me.. my mental health issues.. or my family drama. And a fun job where I get to dress cute and feel positive and I'm terrified of my past employer ruining it for me"

**Here's my story:** I used to have clients and a job as a virtual assistant which I have been doing for about 2 years, however back in October I fell with a really bad depression that made me completely unable to work (couldn't focus, my head hurt all the time, was extremely unmotivated  with no energy and unproductive). I worked until November and then was forced to quit due to complaints of work inefficiency. After that I decided to take  a rest and take care of my mental health while I relied on my savings and aid from my brother to survive those two months. I recovered from depression completely after that break but now the problem is that I lost all my clients (and they already replaced me so won't hire me back), don't have a single penny of savings and don't have anyone to rely on.   


I seriously need a job right now as I'm from Venezuela and the situation here is not easy at all, and I can't rely on my family as they can't afford helping me either (I was a huge burden to my brother those two months and he can't afford helping me anymore as he's struggling himself). I have a rent to pay, pets to take care of and basic expenses to cover so I'm desperate in finding a job. I tried posting on r/slavelabour and r/Jobs4Bitcoins but they won't allow me to post as I ""don't meet the minimum karma and account age requirement"". I also applied for jobs in person but due to the economical crisis in my country the wage they are offering me isn't even enough to pay my rent.

In one of my positions, a candidate went through the entire interview process a week before Christmas. Since it was right before the holidays, there was a small lag between getting all the feedback from the different interviews and making a hiring decision.

Last week, I reached out to the candidate to let them know that we want to give him an update (basically to make him the offer) and wanted to jump on a call.

I know this hiring manager, and though he complains about not having enough people on his team, he lags quite a bit when it comes to hiring/making the offer to the candidate... So I told a white lie (I know, it was wrong of me) that the candidate sounded like he potentially another offer coming to the candidate as a way to light a fire under the HM since this position hasn't been super easy to fill. He started getting super weird, asking about the other offer and just seemed either taken aback or potential offended (?) that the candidate could have another offer besides us

Today, I was trying to push the HM to let me make the offer today (since we've gotten the offer approved by everyone necessary) and since it's been a little over a month since I first spoke with the candidate and we should make a move. After speaking with the candidate and making the offer, the candidate asked for a few days to make a decision.

When I came back to the hiring manager with this information, he wants me to forward him all my email correspondences with this candidate to him, even before the offer was made.

I've never had a HM asked to do this, and I've always thought this was a privacy issue because I've never thought to read someone's emails.

I also, clearly, have no correspondence with the candidate about a potential 2nd offer in email, and now I've put himself in a hole with my white lie.

I know it was wrong of me to lie, but how can I get out of this? Should I just pretend I didn't see it and hope he doesn't come back and ask again?"

1835,Is my new employer shady or am I just paranoid?,jobs,"My current job is insane and I think I'm slowly being ground down into the kind of employee they want. I'm only going to share the most recent experience.

I've been told that I should always do what my manager says. This includes moving materials that need to be stored for a certain period before that time period is up. We test products that are used by the public. I've been told that ""if something happens"" then the blame will fall on the manager. 

I'm not convinced by that and I'm not comfortable with the ethical implications - that someone (me or someone else) could be scapegoated and that people could get hurt. I think the idea is that the chance of ""something"" happening is rare and that they possibly know how to hide the trail i.e. blame components or the end user.

In this business, things like health and safety only matter when they are convenient. I've had some strange experiences that could be gaslighting or could be me being crazy and/or inept (maybe all of those things). I think higher positions that certain people would not normally get are dangled in front of those people. A load of new and young people have been promoted into positions that they could not feasibly have elsewhere. There is a lot of politicking and these same people have compared their jobs to certain TV shows.

There are other issues. My hours get changed frequently and whilst I do make genuine mistakes, there are some that I'm certain have not been done by me i.e. components moved around. We don't have proper HR and contracts are riddled with errors.

I feel like I have good days in this place and then are days where I question how the business is still in operation. I'm also wondering if it is going to collapse in the future."

Before being let go I was interested in finding a new career field and would like to make the transition. I am looking for advice/tips into finding a new career.

I don't know what direction to head in.  I have acquired a lot of skills that are related to the landscape industry but I believe would translate to other fields.  I have managerial experience of delegation, training, quality assurance, scheduling, payroll, budgeting, purchasing and ordering of materials for production.  I have technical skills of equipment operation, machine calibration, mechanical troubleshooting and repair.  Along with industry specific skills of agronomy, chemical application, irrigation system, and condition monitoring.  

I have a bachelors degree in general studies with a concentration in landscape architecture and minor in business foundations.  I'm not opposed to more schooling to change careers but there needs to be a clear translation of new degree to new job. At this point I am just looking for a job to get income and gain experience outside of landscape maintenance.

I entertain job interviews all the time, because I get contacted quite a bit. I got one from Accenture Federal Services, a subsidiary of like the top provider in my field, but my issue with Accenture was that they had no career growth, this position does.

The pay is about the same, but this new role would see me as a senior role and a lead, one step away from manager. The new company provides better resources and more in-depth training. I lose out on the people I like at my job and unlimited PTO, but I would pick up more seniority and responsibility.

The thing is I think I can hit all that at my current company in like a years time.

My current pay is about 90k with bonus coming up and the new job offered 95k with sign-on bonus of 5k. I feel like I should only really switch if they offer 100k or more?

New job provides better training resources and a more defined methodology. Both are remote.

What do you guys think?"

They are suggesting I apply and ask for additional benefits, like an extra week of vacation or dedicated WFH days (traditionally was in office full time)....they are desperate. I think I could get a higher wage then what my new job pays. Has anyone gone back to an old job, and so soon? Any regrets? Any benefits I should ask for to get the best deal in negotiations?

1848,Jobs for new immigrant,jobs,"I have an Algerian friend who wants to migrate to America soon-ish. As a fellow immigrant, I told him the difficulties of migrating here but he still wants to come. 

His credentials: a bachelors and masters from Algeria. He studied electrical engineering and has a job within that field in Algeria. He is also aggressively working to improve his English, he speaks fluent French, Arabic and his tribal language. I stopped seeing jobs that say they'll sponsor people or give people a work visa. Are there any companies within the electrical engineering sector that sponsor immigrants?

Any other advise that you can offer will be greatly appreciated.

1849,Rejections rejections rejections‚Ä¶,jobs,"Great‚Ä¶sorry to sound negative but I just don‚Äôt really know what to do with myself.

It‚Äôs hard to know where to start, but since I graduated in 2016, I‚Äôve basically struggled to get a job. The only proper paid one I got was a customer service one. Everything else was unpaid or lowly paid writing/content writing/digital jobs. Everything has revolved around me getting a job since graduating. I don‚Äôt have the money to move out because I don‚Äôt have a job‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt meet people because I can‚Äôt afford things because I don‚Äôt have a job, etc. 

I‚Äôve wanted to work within digital content since 2018. I have about three years experience of editorial/publication writing and two years experience of digital content - mix of unpaid and paid.

I was made redundant from my customer service job in June 2020 as the building is going under construction. Since then, I applied as much as I could to the industry that I felt I should be in.

A year later in June 2021 I finally got a paid digital job. I was so happy until I basically realised that my manager wanted to do the job herself. She bullied me all the time, belittled me and then made me redundant Dec 17th. 

So back to the drawing board I go. I‚Äôve been applying since mid December and have already received copious rejections. I thought a paid job for 6 months would give me an edge but it seems not. 

On Christmas Eve I started an application process for a junior copywriter role for a stationery company- the same field I just worked in, and as a digital content creator I‚Äôve created a lot of copy. Got to the penultimate stage and was told that I missed out because a candidate had more experience. I had to talk about a task I wrote up for them today, received a lot of praises and was then rejected. So, they liked my writing, but a candidate had more experience‚Ä¶this is a junior role and I kind of assume that experience isn‚Äôt really supposed to be at the core of it?

Honestly, it felt like the closest I‚Äôd get to a chance, I feel like I‚Äôm just going to be stuck again for a year applying for jobs‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt really know what I expect people to say because I know nobody can really help, but I just wanted to vent. I hate the job industry‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all about connections and experience that people have likely gained through these connections - it feels like anybody who is simply just good at what they do will get kicked to the curb merely because they don‚Äôt have a friend of a friend or something."
1850,what is wrong with the job market today? why is no one else talking about this?,jobs," ive applied to probably 25 jobs just this year alone. i saw a job listing locally that pays $33,000 a year that requires a bachelors in business administration AND 4 professional years of experience. why would anyone with a brain work for 15 bucks an hour with a bachelors in business administration and also has 4 years of professional experience when literally target is hiring high school students at the same pay rate. you are stuck at 33,000 a year for 3 years and then you gradually move up the pay scale, but it levels out at around $48k to 50k a year.  gee, thats wonderful. making less than 3k a month before taxes working full time at a ""professional"" job that requires a college education and 4 years experience, not even enough to pay the rent in the city i live in. and yet, its because ""No one wants to work anymore"" and ""You gotta start somewhere"". what a load of BS."
1851,"Offered to interview for promotion, now regretting my initial ""yes""",jobs,"It's amazing what 12 hours can do in terms of mental clarity.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been at my company for around a decade now.  I have a regional manager who reports to the national manager.  There are ten regional managers in total throughout the country.  A few years ago I interviewed for one of those regional positions, due to the amazing location, but was not selected (this was expected, the individual that got it was better qualified).

&amp;nbsp;

Today I was offered to interview against three other individuals (in company) for another regional position.  The other three, as told to me by the national manager, wanted the end of the week to think about.  Instinctively I jumped right in and said I was interested and would like to interview.  Unsurprisingly the national manager was happy.

&amp;nbsp;

*That said*, he mentioned one thing during the call (he's in a different office) that didn't initially hit me.  He said this was for the regional manager who has to travel, and that the expectation would be a good amount of traveling.  Maybe I was just riding the high of getting the offer to interview, but it didn't hit me for a few hours.  And, when it hit me, it hit me hard.  My spouse said they fine with me traveling (I travel only once-twice a year now, that would increase to once a week), but I could see it in their eyes that they weren't happy about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Is the best move here to call the national manager tomorrow and say something like, ""After sleeping on it I've decided I can't commit to the travel expectations of the job.""  The national manager is a pretty dry person, and I can't see them not being thrilled that I've done a 180.  Also, this might get me passed up on the next promotion (has a history of doing this).  That said, I like my current role and location.  It's giving me a lot of anxiety just thinking about the travel requirements.  Even traveling [for work] a few times a year was wearing on me.

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, how would you guys best go about turning down an acceptance for an interview the following day?  My brother thinks I should just ""sandbag"" (professionally that is, don't get me wrong) the interview, but that sounds like a terrible idea.  I also don't think going through the whole process only to turn it down [potentially] would be wise either.  I'm of the mindset that I just need to call my national manager tomorrow and say that after sleeping on it I'm not interested in the position."

And i was like cool, it can give me time have that money saved after tax season for me to look for a new job.. So i quit my FT job to do a seasonal tax season at a cpa firm

We were all pissed cuz we were told interview day that itd be 12 hours, 7 days.. 

WTF, isnt that messed up.. Bascally quit my FT job in hopes to rack up or work a lot during tax season that way i had enought after tax season to quickly look for a  new job.. Finding a job these days takes LONG, thats how i got my first job if i remeber correctly..

1858,I had to reject a potential job that I had been eyeing for years because I got a better one,jobs,"Just got a new job and cancelled a bunch of interviews. I've been job hunting for months.

One of the rejected offers was at a big company that I've been eyeing for literally years. This was like my third time applying for this company. The interviews went very well and you have no idea how happy I would've been to take the job.

But then my backup job came through sooner with an offer. It was a backup because although the work would be great, the salary was lowballed for the level of experience on the job posting. On the actual offer, the total comp came in so much higher than what was advertised (almost 30%!). Higher base, bonus, cost reimbursements, stocks, etc. It's the whole cushy package and I just couldn't say no to it! I thought I had bombed the interviews too

Just two weeks ago, I was rejected for another job at the very end... interviewer called me and said I was one of the two final candidates. I was bitter because obviously the interviews were great, I was hopeful, and I had no backup. In hindsight I'm so happy it happened!

2022 so far so good!"
1859,Passed up for a promotion which caused a paradigm shift in my outlook,jobs,"Just looking to vent and get a little third party advice from people who can act as unbiased (to the situation).

So back story. I‚Äôve been at my job for almost 3.5 years now. I‚Äôm late 20‚Äôs, college educated, no debt, working fully remote in the supply chain industry. I started as an analyst about 3.5 years ago and was promoted to teamlead around 1.75 years ago. When I got promoted, I told myself I‚Äôd make supervisor in 1.5-2 years. In November, I was interviewed for the position but did not hear. Last week of December comes by and I find out another lead has gotten the job. There were also 2 analysts that were promoted to leads. 

So I got passed up. All three promotions were to women with young children aged 1-3 (covid babies). I have no problem with this if you can keep your work life on track. The problem is that I‚Äôve been covering for the woman who got promoted to supervisor for 6months any time she needs to take care of her kid (kids sick, day is closing due to covid outbreak, boyfriend got scheduled for a shift). I‚Äôm the kind of guy that believes if you do the dirty deed of bringing a kid into the world, no#1 priority should be to raise a healthy, happy, productive men ever of society- so I‚Äôve always said take care of your kid/family and I‚Äôll hold the fort down. This has also happened multiple times with the two promoted to lead. They are all nice people- just work isn‚Äôt priority no#1. The 3 single guys/ no kids/ work full hours kinda guys all got passed up for promotion even though We do more than our fair share of the work.

I‚Äôve talked off line with everyone individually and they‚Äôve all noted that the path upward is seemingly blocked with these new promotions and it seems like failing upward is the only way to get a promotion. All are considering leaving as the market is hot for supply chain right now and leaving this mess to the 3 people who got promoted. I don‚Äôt want to be left holding the bag of responsibility when my coworkers/supervisor are all taking care of their families on company time. Can I even go to hR with my concerns and not make it sound sexist? Or should I just find myself a new job ASAP."
1860,How do you not feel guilty about leaving work 'unfinished' if you have more tasks than 1 person should?,jobs,"Hey Redditors, looking for some advice!

I recently started working for a large corporation. In my short time there so far, I've realised that our team is grossly understaffed. 

All my colleagues are doing the work of more than 1 person. 

Because I've only recently started my workload has been quite light. But we are now heading into a busy time and I'm expecting my workload to ramp up dramatically.

I even managed to speak to the guy who was in this role before me and he warned me the reason he left was an insane workload and was working silly hours.

Now, I like to think I'm not a pushover. I've already set some precedents, e.g. I switch off the computer at 5pm and I do not check emails outside work hours. I also see my job as a means to an end. 

Despite all this, I'm still a bit apprehensive about my workload ramping up to unfeasible levels. It looks certain very soon I'll have more workload on my plate than I can do in my 9-5 hours. 

With more workload than hours how do I just do what I can and not feel guilty about leaving the stuff I can't do? I am unwilling to work past my hours but at the same time I'm slightly afraid of the consequences if to others it looks like I'm leaving work 'unfinished'. 

Also how do you communicate that you will do your hours but if there's still work after this, tough?"

They knew this and asked that we ""grab a beer"" together.

What's my goal here? I've never had to network for a job before, this concept is somewhat foreign to me. Until this job I've basically been a peon and never had to meet with any big wigs or (for a lack of a better term) schmooze other companies in hopes of making lasting connections.

However, I did give a very detailed reply and apologized for replying late. 2 days had passed since the email was first sent, and the scheduled interview was the next day after I finally replied. 

The original email about the interview was in a friendly tone, but after I replied to it, the reply back to me was in a neutral tone. Does that mean the hiring manager was already thinking negatively of me?

I just had the interview, which I think went well, and it was for a small start-up so the interviewer was actually the CEO/founder. It also turned out that that the second email to me was from the CEO since they needed to find somebody for a position quickly. But I had the bad luck of having the lights go out a few minutes before the interview due to a circuit breaker tripping. I had to fix that and was late to the interview by 2 minutes. I explained to the CEO and he said it was no big deal. However, I'm afraid that the late email situation combined with me joining the interview late, my chances of getting hired were affected. I'm afraid that since I already replied to an email late, the CEO would think that I was lying when I explained why I joined the interview late. 

Am I overthinking? Are they gonna think that I'm terrible and will be late to everything?"

I'm a job seeker and I received a text message from an ""Olivia Wright"" from ""Nordic Pharma Inc"" saying that she wanted to interview over Skype chat. During our chat, she said that I was accepted for a job offer, and they sent me a ""job offer document"" the same day. I was really excited about this as the pay was $21/hr during training and $35/hr after that, which involved data entry/accounting/CS/admin work.

Then they sent me a check for $3990 to allegedly buy equipment - PC, software, scanner, printer and fax. I asked her why she's sending a check to me, and why can't they purchase it themselves then forward the equipment to me. She said that its their company policy for new hires to receive the funds in order to show that they can manage it well. I received the check, deposited it through ATM, and it CLEARED the following day.

When the check cleared, Olivia asked me to transfer funds to several people. She said these people were ""vendors"" who will then ship the equipment to me. I transferred the funds to the ""vendors"" as she had advised.

Today, Wells Fargo sent me an email saying that my account is in a negative balance because the check was bad. I called Wells Fargo and was basically told to file a claim and that they will investigate it. I am devastated, because WF is holding up the money intended for our rent and utilities. I did not transfer money out of our own funds, and instead forwarded the funds that were cleared from the check. I just feel so stupid and dumb. 

I'm posting this so that other job seekers would be able to search up the name of the fraudsters and hopefully avoid them. I failed to do that. I didn't do my research and instead got too happy/excited that I found a job and I can finally help our family.

I'm currently finishing my degree (bachelor's), which I have put on hold because I started working a lot while at uni. Aside from that, I'm unemployed with a 1 year gap on my resume. 

So I am technically a grad student, but with years of work experience.

The job I'm aiming for is Project Manager, I have worked in Operations/Stategy and Client/Marketing in a small team company, I have owned a small business. My job title has never been on official contracts as I wasn't directly employed by the company but was a long-term external collaborator, so I just use well known titles to convey what my duties were. 

My degree is relevant to my desired role, but it's not a direct 1:1 correlation (example, Computer Science degrees lead to Devs/SoftwareEng roles, but Tech Project Management is still relevant).

Do you think WFH jobs will stick around or dramatically decrease in volume? Many companies have proven increases in productivity from pre-pandemic numbers. Office buildings are huge sources of overhead that can be eliminated/reduced.

And then there‚Äôs the people who packed up and moved due to WFH. Will their employer cut them loose in a couple years or ask they come back?"

I am 10 days past my last time I smoked THC and not planning on continuing for a long time. I know I cannot pass a test right now, but should I apply for jobs now or wait until I'm clean?

1895,Applied to *remote* job and they want me to relocate on my own dime,jobs,"I applied to a job for a company in another state that was labeled as \*remote\*. The recruiter reached out to me and asked if I would be willing relocate to the city of the company headquarters, and then added that it would be on my dime and there is no reimbursement available. They want the person in the physical area to meet with clients and staff from time to time.

I countered ""since the job description said 'remote', is it possible to conduct meetings via video like Zoom? I wouldn't be opposed to occasional travel, but do not want to relocate, especially if the vast majority of working time will be spent remote anyway.""

Like a robot, she replied ""the hiring manager is requiring that the person is located near the headquarters"". Meanwhile, this recruiter is emailing me from a state that is neither my home nor the headquarters, so she is definitely remote.

I would be interested to know if the hiring manager is aware how stingy the recruiter is being here. Companies are really missing out in this time of The Great Resignation by not only not being flexible to work remotely, but also expecting someone to relocate with no reimbursement. No, thanks!"

I realized it was a position I had never applied for, but the person who contacted me sent a job description and everything looked good. There were instructions included on how to schedule an interview which involved downloading a software called Wire (kind of like Zoom or Teams but I'd never heard of it before), setting up an account and connecting with the HR person. I did this, then the HR person messaged me if I was available now for an interview. It would just be a text chat through Wire in which they would ask a couple questions and would take about 30 minutes. I said sure, and went through with the interview. 

I saw a few potential red flags -- 

1. Is it weird that it was a text-based interview? I have never done an interview like this before. 
2. HR person said I would need a work cell phone - ""A second physical phone and line best from your already existing post paid account on your carrier."" Does this mean I would have to set up a line for a work phone using my personal cell phone plan? I asked for more clarification on this but they just moved to the next question.
3. The company and job description seem legit, but the job description emailed to me isn't listed on their website. 

Is this weird? Am I overreacting? I've never had an interview experience like this and am trying to make sense of things. Thanks!"

It's unfair to the rest of us and there's only four of us total in our department.  If someone's out more than they are working they shouldn't have a job.

1908,Ghosting or something else?,jobs,"TLDR; interviewers and HR are ghosts, and don't keep their word.  Best way to extract updates/find out if the position is filled without blowing what may still be an opportunity?

I've applied for a few jobs over the past six months, based on location, position and pay.  One organization stated in the posting that all applications will be acknowledged.  A month went by, so I emailed the HR contact listed and only received a generic response, but no true answer to my inquiry of was my resume and materials received intact?

I interviewed for another position at the end of October, and was given the anticipated start date, told that I would be told the next week if I was out or if I was coming back for another interview.  No follow up at all from them.  This was well before the holidays could've interfered.  

I applied to yet another and received an interview, seemed to go well, spent some time listening to their HR talking about how they set interviews and candidates don't show up or drop out of the process before they can be hired, so I thought they get it, if I'm courteous and responsive, they'll do the same.  It's been a month since that interview and no follow up.

Shortly after that, I received an interview from a place I had applied to a month earlier and forgot about.  It was the best fit and most desirable position.  The interview was great, my qualifications and experience matches well, and the interviewers either loved my responses or were just BS'ing me for whatever reason.  

I continue to apply and interview, and I could be receiving an offer from someone that doesn't ghost me like these other places, so at what point is it appropriate to reach out for an update?  I don't want to be pushy and blow an opportunity that may be in the pipeline, but how can employers expect to get quality workers if they leave you with such uncertainty?  I hate the prospect of accepting an offer and starting only to have to leave because a much better offer comes through, but I owe it to myself to get as much compensation as possible, and frankly, need to.

I believe if an offer is coming my way, it will come without me having to follow up on it, and calling HR or an interviewer for an update might actually make them cross me off the list for being ""impatient,"" but it is hard to make decisions without information.  I'm not applying to huge, distant corporations, but rather small local organizations.  I would expect more courtesy from them when they have local reputations to project, but mostly I find that not only are they incapable of issuing a rejection letter, but don't even follow through on what they say they will do by giving the promised updates.  Are they frightened that a candidate might yell at them, or worse?  I can't understand the juvenile way they conduct themselves.

At what point is it appropriate to ask for an update on the process, and what is the best way to phrase these requests?"
1909,The Choices I Made...,jobs,"I'm feeling stuck. I don't regret the choices that I've made but I feel like the roads and turns my life has taken me has left me in a spot where I'm not sure how I can progress well with work. 

I studied the environmental field in school - specifically ecology. However, I wasn't aware and also lacked the discipline to get field jobs - which I later discovered I probably wasn't well suited anyways to days or weeks working remotely. I'm a person of habit, you see. It gives me comfort to know what grocery store I'd go to to get food for dinner. 

Since then, it took me a few years after university to find a ""career"" and I now work for an environmental engineering company. A massive, global one. And I hate it. Mostly because the department is deteriorating and doesn't get much work, yet the manager keeps hiring people and it has made me feel so completely unappreciated as a worker there. To be honest, I took the job to keep my relationship with my now husband. I was worried where I would find work and this was my one interview and job offer with a good salary so I took it - knowing it was my way to be able to get married, buy a house and start a family. And we did, which I am so grateful for.   


However, I'm feeling so lost now, since I just returned from a mat leave in the past year, and I'm now expecting our second in a few months. I have desperately wanted to quit my job but I didn't want to start with a new company and leave for mat leave again a few months later. I'm scared that I won't find another position with a salary that could still help support this family of ours. I would not trade them to have a successful career, but I guess I was hoping to at least not feel stuck in a dead-end career track. 

I would love to hear any suggestions or similar stories of people switching work after mat leave, dealing with job searching and careers in the environmental field, or anything you think will help."

Also, my current job seems less stressful because I have some downtime. Whereas, the other job would be doing 40-50 calls a day, with chats, and tickets.

So, I work for a company which outsources people and our boss is from another country.

Nothing wrong with that except he always is bragging very loud about his life - how much money he/they outside make, how he travels a lot, has always best and newst cars, lives in best city, how he is very successful with women, he is partying a lot, belittle our religion (in a subtle way and he belongs to another one).

My team (including me) ignores this and we always try to keep everything professionall (don‚Äôt say anything), but it‚Äôs kinda very rude to say you are making 7-8x more than us, because we are underpaid for the work we do.

1942,How would you approach accepting and then going back on a job offer?,jobs,"I like the company I work for just fine, but the work I do has become a little stale and the only way to get a significant pay increase is to leave and go somewhere else.

I put my resume online and immediately got a response. The new job would be challenging, fun, and they offered to pay me about $15k/yr more than what I currently make. I accepted their offer and put in my two weeks notice at my current employer. I didn't remove my resume from the job site it was on, and during the first week of my two week notice, I received a response from a headhunter about another opportunity. I told him my situation and he said it might not hurt to go on the interview, after all, it is an employees market right now. So I agreed to the interview and the second job is a lot like the first, it would be challenging and fun. They usually have a lengthier interview process, but they sped things up after I explained my situation. I told them if I started at the new job I was staying there regardless of their offer and they understood that. I am meeting with them later today to talk about an offer they are drafting up. I have a feeling it is going to be $10k-$15k more per year than what the other company is offering ($25k-$30k more than my current job). If it is, I intend on breaking my commitment to the first company and going with the second.

So as the title states, how would you approach this situation? I feel bad for accepting and then going back on the offer of the first company, but I do have to look out for me and my family first, right? I would like to thing that if I was doing the hiring, I would understand the decision, but my opinion in this situation is biased. Any insight from employees/employers?

In two weeks I have the opportunity to either get a back piece or change it to an intricate chest piece that is simply line work.

For the record my job is secure and stable."
1944,"Hardly getting any tasks during probation period, and I'm getting worried",jobs,"The second month of the 3 month long probation period just passed by, and I'm getting worried.

I'm working as an AI developer, and it's my first job ever. I remember even back when I was like 5 years old, I wanted to become a ""robot builder"", and I guess it's close to that. Point is, it's a job that I've always been interested in ever since I can remember, and I love the atmosphere and the colleagues at my place. The salary is pretty good as well, so it's like a dream job for me.

However, there's one issue. The first 2 weeks of the probation period were supposed to be the training, and after that I would've been put into a newly created team. The issue was, that after my first month of work, the team still wasn't made, and it turned out that it wouldn't be made either, because the client changed their mind.

So after a lot of organization, my manager told me that there would be a different, but also new team made in early January that I could join. Time passed by, it's been over 2 months since I started my job, but I still don't have a team, nor do I have tasks. During these 2 months, I wasn't given the opportunity to do anything noteworthy, all I was able to do is watch training videos 8 hours a day and put some of that into practice. I did have a week when I was able to help another team and did some unit testing and code refactoring, and during that week I felt very productive and happy that I was able to finally able to give something to the company, even if it was small in the grand scheme of things. Aside from that, I'm attending to meetings daily and learning from training material, but that's about it. And I feel guilty for earning almost as much as my parents combined while just watching training material in my worktime. It also gives me really strong imposter syndrome.

There's less than a month left from my probation period, and I don't have much which they could judge my performance on. I asked my manager a few times for updates on the new team, but he seemed rather annoyed by clients not being able to make up their minds. He also told me he would update me if there were any news.

Should I be worried of getting fired after the probation period ends? I wasn't able to prove my worth due to the lack of tasks I was getting, but at the same time a company wouldn't pay someone for 3 months, giving them training material they pay for just to fire them, would they? I've also been trying to ask for tasks in the team I helped earlier, but due to the lack of access I have, they can't really give me anything.

It's like a dream job for me, I love the building, love the co-workers, my manager is really kind as well, and the area I'll be working in (once I get a team) is something that has interested me for the longest, but I feel like failing or passing the probation period is out of my hands, unless my new team gets created really soon.

Do you have any experiences/opinions with similar situations? How strictly do companies take the end of probation period? Am I more likely to stay with the company after the lot of training I've done, or am I more likely to get rejected for not being able to perform due to the weird circumstances? As far as I'm concerned, the company is still trying to grow and have more employees as of now. How worried should I be?

Thank you everyone for the feedback in advance!"
1945,Advice on taking an LOA vs quitting,jobs,"In short, I've been in my job for 2.5 years and have known since month 6 that the job was not a good fit for me.

I know that if I take a LOA I will be pushing off the inevitable (resigning) but staying with the organization doesn't seem like a terrible idea, in case I somehow change my mind (doubtful). Has anyone been in this position and/or have any advice on what to do?? TYIA."
1946,I feel so guilty,jobs,I have been invited to interview to a job that I know for a fact that I would hate. It is not really related to anything I want to work on in the future and I particularly hate this area of work. It doesn‚Äôt pay well and it‚Äôs a very small company. But everyone around me keeps telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be picky and that I shouldn‚Äôt come crying to them if I didn‚Äôt find anything. It is hard to find something where I live but I have only been out of a job like less than a week. Would I be making the wrong decision here if I didn‚Äôt accept the job? I really think I will be miserable if I worked there but I‚Äôm afraid that I won‚Äôt be able to find anything

What do I do to make this less awful for me?,jobs,"I work for a large international consulting engineering and architecture company (10,000+ people). My very specific department in my location however has 3 entry-level engineers (including myself) 1 mid-level engineer, and a handful (maybe 5 total) of senior-level engineers, managers, and scientists. 

My company is requiring that all employees be fully vaccinated by the 18th of this month (they have to because we work on federal projects) and the mid-level engineer has made it abundantly clear that they have no intentions of getting it and doesn‚Äôt qualify for any exemptions. 

They are almost certainly going to lose his job over this, and no one has mentioned anything about it and there are no plans for replacing them. This means that the other two entry-level engineers and I will need to pick up nearly all of their work until the company replaces them (which may not even happen). 

I assume that there are others in the same boat as me. Any advice?

TL/DR - Going to have a lot more work to do when my co-worker gets fired for not getting the jab. Any advice?"

Predominantly searching/applying via Linkedin and Indeed. Had my resume reviewed and tweaked by a professional recruiter friend-of-a-friend. Just not getting any positive replies.

Is it just a matter of putting more time/energy into it and finding ways to get more applications out there? The only must-have's I'm looking for are pretty basic: full-time work, remote, and at least X salary (should be ""easy"" since I'm objectively underpaid currently and only looking for a modest increase). Not particularly picky about what/where, beyond those.

The only thing I can kinda see as a potential negative is that I have significant experience in one field but there's limited opportunities, so I'm open to/looking for an industry change (similar position in a different field, if that makes sense). So I have the skills, just not the diverse experience elsewhere - like a director whose made 10 action movies trying to get into comedies."
1956,Starting to get sick of my job,jobs,"From 18-25 I worked for myself owning businesses and trading stocks. I decided last March that I should put the skills I taught myself to use and start doing freelance media buying (advertising management). That quickly turned into get a job at a small marketing agency where I work 9-5 (which I am not used to). At first I loved it, I still had a side business, time to day trade in the mornings, and I was getting a steady income.   


I was getting raises every 2-3 months. Now I've gone 4 months without a raise and the amount of work I have to do keeps growing since I'm the go to guy for a lot of things and I manage most accounts the marketing agency has.   


I feel like I'm getting overworked and underpaid (making $6k/mo which is a decent amount, but not for how hard I work). On top of that from Mon-Wed, there is nothing but meetings. In total there is only around 2-3 hours out of my day to actually do my job.   


I know that if I were to confront him about this he would just say well you will probably have to get up earlier and work a little later. I definitely screwed myself a bit by being an overachiever for the first couple of months by working later than normal just to hit a couple of deadlines. That, however, was justified by the constant raises. Now I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and my quality of work has degraded because I'm in meetings for the majority of the day from mon-wed.   


Just to clarify these meetings didn't start until 4-5 months into the job. For the first 4-5 months there would be 1-3 meetings a week.   


Is this the norm in the 9-5 world? Since the last 9-5 job I worked was Subway when I was 17 I don't know what the norm is. Should I confront my boss about this?   
I really don't want to live to work, especially for $6k/mo; but with this job it seems like there isn't much of an option.   


I honestly need the consistent income as my income has always fluctuated but I'm not sure how much longer I can take it. Not only has it affected my day-to-day life, it affected my mental health, physical health, drive to keep my side business going, and drive to day trade stocks.

I graduated in 2020 and sent out my resumes with the following headers in order:

* Education
* Relevant Skills
   * (Job Specific Skills)
   * Computer Skills
   * Safety &amp; Certifications
* Technical Projects (Regarding the degree)
* Work Experience (Only 1 job listed here, as hotel clerk, completely irrelevant to my degree/career)
* Volunteer Experience
* Professional Memberships

I ended up getting a job, but now I am trying to broaden my scope with the experience I have gained.

How should I end up laying out my resume? I would think now with the experience, I should perhaps put it first? Should I add the hotel clerk position as well? Do technical projects matter 2 years after I've graduated? They regard professional memberships (designations) fairly high too. Is volunteer experience something they look for? I hope you are able to help me.

1959,How to prepare for full time work after MH leave? and CV questions,jobs,"I dropped out of university and went on disability benefits/stayed legally unemployed for a few years. I've started volunteering for 8 hours a week since the end of last November, and am wondering how to make my way into employment. I don't plan on going into the industry I studied because I didn't enjoy it, couldn't network, and I've forgotten a lot of what I was taught. I'll probably end up in retail or as a receptionist. I don't know what I need to prepare. 

My idea was to volunteer for about 3 months to work up my momentum and make sure I don't have a breakdown or something, then get a part time job (while still volunteering) for a couple months, then either phase to full time there or go somewhere else to work by July, maybe? not sure about that time frame. 

Given that I went out of uni into unemployment, I don't have the most exciting CV. I volunteered a couple other places but that was only once or twice a month. Should I create a LinkedIn profile? Pick up a hobby that would look good? I don't know what my personal statement would be or what my skills are. Should I mention my degree (more like a diploma of higher education) even if I want nothing to do with it? I'll probably speak about this with the job centre in the future, but I had to ask here because I feel like if I'm capable of volunteering then I should move as quickly as I can into employment, right? And if that's the case then I need to do some foundation laying in my own time."

I worked for a non-profit as a research scientist before I left the plant/science path and switched to a different non-profit.  And then the pandemic hit and I was let go for budget reasons.

Since then I have been working as a barista.  I don't hate my job, my manager is really incredible and the company as a whole is good to work for.  But I don't have health benefits (or really any other benefits other than taking home day-old pastries).

So basically first 2 weeks gonna be filled with endless lectures in a classroom and then exams at the end of each week. 

It takes 1 hour to commute cos of the peak hour, will be just listening to the trainer talking for 10 hours and then rush home to attend another class for another 3 hours(night class).

My colleagues are quite young except for few of them. I think they‚Äôre quite nice. That‚Äôs the only thing that is good about the job. The trainer seems smug.

So I thought of submitting my resignation letter today however I need to serve 2 weeks(I‚Äôm under an agency). Is there a way for me not to serve it? I don‚Äôt mind to serve but I don‚Äôt see the point because they made me sign a lot of confidentiality forms and I‚Äôm under one month training.

1994,Where to even start after failed music career,jobs,"I am here looking for advice on what decent jobs I could get after a decade of being a musician. I have a Bachelor‚Äôs in Journalism with a minor in Biological sciences. Problem is I HATE the entertainment/music industry and want to completely refocus. I‚Äôm interested in tech and VR but have nothing to offer them. And I‚Äôm at a complete loss on how to re-adapt to office settings and knowing how to not sound like a complete loser to business people. We all know what is thought of musicians, but truth is I was practically running my own business all those years. I learned to market, to network, to engage, to develop websites and ads and email marketing, to write up articles, to plan and run events, to direct music video sets, to understand different markets, and a little of many different aspects it takes to run a business (photography, design, videography, fashion, social media, etc). The problem is now I feel so SO lost where to even begin to explain this on a resume that will land me an interview. I never hear back and I‚Äôm never even given a chance. I‚Äôm tired of struggling and I want a new beginning. I was working 24/7 for nearly ten years without pay until my last few years when I started to really catch on. How can I even explain this and be taken seriously as a candidate? Help please, any suggestions for where and how I can apply? I‚Äôm open to entry level in a field where there is a lot of room to grow!

If you‚Äôd like to understand more in depth, here‚Äôs the longer explanation:

I have been in the music industry as an indie artist for a decade. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a complete failure, my music is now worldwide and has been viral several times and I get joy out of watching the joy it brings people. But it never paid as successful as it was and let‚Äôs be honest, I had to pay my bills no matter how much I enjoyed making music the first few years. (After years of full-time work in it, it becomes just a job; and even worse if you do it wrong like me because there‚Äôs no blue-print just trial and error; a 24-hour job that doesn‚Äôt pay well)

I was a pioneer for the female Latin Reggaeton scene and took some sounds from underground to now seeing it becoming mainstream. I was robbed a lot along the way by major artists who took but never credited and though I took on so much stress, I‚Äôve learned to let a lot of that go. Lots of therapy!

However, money-wise, it never paid more than a hobby aside from some commercial deals here and there and I was starting to be paid a lot for shows. And I worked with so many major artists but those songs were never released. I have little to show. Everyone in the Latin music world knows or has heard of me but outside of that no one knows.

Thing is I got extremely burnt out and neglected everything about my health until crumbs were left and my health forced me to refocus. I injured my spine along the way and can no longer do shows. Basically killing my career, which let me just point out actually made me VERY HAPPY. I didn‚Äôt want to do it any more, I lost the love along the way and grew out of it. Honestly, I can‚Äôt even enjoy music anymore at all. I prefer to sit in silence. 

I say all this to say, now that I am happily moving on I AM STRUGGLING to adjust. It almost feels like I‚Äôm trying to re-adapt after coming out of a mental prison. I feel completely lost because all of my focus and energy was in music this whole time. 

The job market is confusing, I don‚Äôt know how to explain I was a musician for a decade and accomplished little I can show. I feel like a fucking loser trying to move on with my life and go into another field. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I have a nice apartment and can‚Äôt even afford to sit on this long. I have to get a good job and preferably one I can grow in. I‚Äôm super interested in tech and VR, but I just keep thinking who tf will hire a failed musician? I have so much knowledge of the music industry but THAT‚ÄôS IT. I know nothing else and I hate the music industry. 

If you have been in my shoes, I would really appreciate some advice. And I‚Äôm not looking for info on continuing my music career, not interested. Sync deal info ok cool, but more so I‚Äôm looking into how I can change career fields in a smooth way that doesn‚Äôt involve a lot more stress or struggle. I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs sympathy either, job advice only please."

For the longest time, I've wanted to be a surgeon, and so understandably, I've been taking course work in hopes to go to medical school. I've had an event pop up that has given me the opportunity to look at possible career paths, and now after looking, I'm not quite sure what I want in life anymore. I really love science (specifically anatomy/physio) and the aspect of healing people is so amazing to me. No other career path (that I know of) presents that opportunity. I would be so happy doing that, but I also would like to enjoy my youth and care about being financially stable from the get-go, rather than 10 years down the line. Becoming a surgeon would take a long time before I start making money to pay back student loans for undergrad and med school. My youth would also be a thing of the past haha. I'm also interested in technology and business as well as traveling. I feel that the medical world is transitioning into a much more A.I and tech dominated field, and the ROI on a medical degree is decreasing. Are there other career options that give me the ability to deal with tech, business, and medicine? Or tech business within medicine? I'm having one of those moments where you don't know what you want to do with your life anymore and it feels very overwhelming."

I did go to work one day that week when I finally felt better, but the next day I didn't go in because two weeks prior to that I'd requested that time off for a planned trip out of town. I requested off both the Friday and the Monday, which is where I am now. My vacation plans fell through literally the night before the trip, but I still don't really want to go in to work on a day I'm supposed to be off. Yet, it's been eating at my mind all day long only because I know I missed three days already being sick last week. I don't know if I'm just being a ""goodie two shoes"" or if I am seriously being a bad employee by not going in. Also, my supervisor was allegedly looking for me that Friday I didn't show up so that worries me as well, even though she has already approved the days off. This is my first job and though I've been there a year and several months at this point it's just nerve-wracking. But I'm also wanting to take every day off I have because since we are literally always short staffed, sometimes it only being me and one other person on my line at work, I know I might not get a break like this again for a while. I just need some advice on what I should probably do. It's not the type of job to fire me since they are pretty flexible and work with people to get them to stay so I'm not worried about getting fired for taking advantage of my off days. It's more of a guilty conscience. Any advice helps."

I have always been passionate about anything related to technology, and for some reason, it just comes naturally to me. As a teacher, I spent so much time creating assessments using various tools to identify student strengths and weaknesses. I would organize the data in a way that made it easy for anyone to analyze, but I really was doing this for my own needs as a more visual person. When we started using Learning Management Systems, all the other teachers kept their pages basic because they had no idea what to do. I was designing my own course logos, buttons, and doing whatever I could to make it more engaging for my students. I altered code to change the sizes of videos and to change the interface as much as I could through HTML code. I designed most of the games and worksheets for my students because I wanted to make it more engaging than the standard worksheet. 

I also have an Etsy shop that I hear I shouldn‚Äôt put in my resume, but I learned the ins and outs of SEO and held marketing campaigns on various social media platforms to drive traffic to my shop. I got my own domain and host connect my shop to Google analytics, which I used to collect and analyze data based on user behavior. 

I have already left teaching, and my reputation as a teacher is great, but it was time for me to leave to focus on a career that allows me to grow professionally. I know I would be great at a career in User Experience Research/UX Design, but my experience as a teacher can‚Äôt possibly explain my skills in this area adequately enough to stand out. I have it all there though, including the soft skills needed. I‚Äôm flexible, easy going, and great at collaboration. Sure, I can highlight these skills on a resume but I fear it will be impossible to make such a huge leap based on a resume alone. Any advice?"

The county jail corrections deputies are a part of county staff. The most recent Covid outbreak has put an influx of leave requests on the leave specialist due to Covid circulating around the jail. I was told, not asked, that I could work overtime to help the leave specialist get caught up with all the leave requests.

It‚Äôs frustrating that as a high performer in the work place I just get more work with no additional pay. My boss told me I could request a PDQ if she thought I wasn‚Äôt getting paid in line with my classification.

2032,Should I leave my established job for a startup role?,jobs,"Quick backstory:  I left a very successful start-up back in early September. There were quite a few personal and professional reasons as to why I left, but mostly professional reasons. Overall, a lot of management were ""Yes"" people to the executive team and there were horribly managed projects and initiatives that were rolled out which lead me to leave. 

I began working for a more established, very large company in October and at first, it was good. It's fully remote, one task-focused, has fantastic benefits and PTO. But over the course of a few months, I'm starting to feel as if I was only hired to fill a seat. I have hardly any work but yet all my other coworkers are super busy despite us having the same role and tasks. My onboarding was hardly anything and honestly the worst I've ever had. I have hardly any meetings, no one talks to each other (not even small talk), and I sit at my computer for 7 out of the 8hrs jiggling my mouse to stay active because I genuinely have nothing to do. I don't want to work 8hrs+ straight....but come on. I'm also not used to one task roles as I had roles in the past were I was part of multiple processes and decisions. So that fact I have one task for my role is making me feel like I have a restless leg with my role. Plus, I was hired as part of a project team that has a deadline to meet regulations by 2024. I have yet to hear from the managers what will happen to the team after the project is over, even when I interviewed and asked this question. It also does not ease my mind that the company has hired 10 others to the team with the same job role as me in the past year to ensure the project is accomplished. 

I recently started interviewing with another start-up for a role that is closer to where I live, follows suit with my experience and education, and would be paying significantly more than what I'm currently being paid and are allowing me to be hybrid (which I actually prefer). I believe in the mission of the company and the team I met so far is very knowledgeable in their experiences in the industry. They were honest about the role and onboarding seeming a bit unstructured since they are still developing it, but are working on it. They're really pushing their company due to COVID but have post-pandemic plans as well. I do have reservations that because it is a start-up, I would be regretting the job very soon after due to my past experience with start-ups. As well, I am afraid that there might be a chance that the startup goes bust in the next year or so and I'm back to job searching (there is No evidence of this happening, but I'm just worried.)

1.) Would it be stupid to resign from my current position for this start-up? 

2.) How would I explain how I was at this large, established company for only a few months in future job roles I would be interviewing for? 

3.) Am I sacrificing stability and comfort for pay? 

4.) What should I do in this situation? 

I don't really have anyone in my life to talk about this situation to, so any honest advice would be helpful!"

From what they have both said, software testing isn't that hard (at least for manual testing), and is a great starting point for an IT or developer career. All of the ""skills"" these courses taught me were like, 96 percent terminology. So I go and look at jobs to apply to and they are all extremely far beyond me. Years of experience required. Expert level testing and/or automation skills required. I don't have experience in this field. My career advisor just tells me to look for jobs and apply to them; that they'll teach me what I need to know. Weird that they would teach me but ask for 2 years of experience testing.

The most recent course I took advised *against* learning automation until you have become a great manual tester through *working as a manual tester*. Is this good advice? I have no idea.

So I'm at a loss. I've never had a career before and this particular one fits my personality and mindset very well the more I learn about it and the more I practice it. I legitimately think I would be good at it, but I have no idea how I'm supposed to even get into an entry level position when the requirements are so far beyond me. They are jobs I cannot apply to.

Anyways.. I‚Äôve been going back and forth about resigning. Everyday I‚Äôm changing my resignation letter‚Äôs date. And I‚Äôm 3 months into this accounts receivable associate job and it‚Äôs so mind numbing, I can‚Äôt see myself doing this for another day‚Ä¶ Let alone another 25 years or so idk.

I think the reason why I‚Äôm also kinda reluctant to quit is due to the fact that the job market is tough. I‚Äôve been applying to different jobs now but haven‚Äôt even heard back from any one of them. But this job is costing my mental health and I know I have to do something about it too.

Please help me out. Please advice. Thank you in advance."
2044,how can i live off these jobs these days? serious question.,jobs,"seriously. i live in a supposed low cost of living area in the midwest.  over 90% of the jobs they are hiring here pay 14 or less an hour, ive applied to dozens of them and even after interviewing i am not getting any luck.  How am i suppose to make a living making less than 30,000 dollars a year when my expenses are 2,500 a month for the bare minimum, even if i manage to get one of these crummy jobs?  how can i go back to school or learn a trade or just ""work harder"" ""Study harder"" or ""network"" when i am in heavy debt and already  have commitments during the day so i dont go homeless.  everyone here seems to think its so easy just to go and find a job and move up the ladder to the ivory tower positions.  nothing makes sense anymore.  i already know everyone here is gonna say oh go back to school and learn programming or go learn plumbing or electric work and make 6 figures a year, i did it and you can too."

Besides all of that, I‚Äôve been wanting to move up because I know I‚Äôm ready for it and want to challenge myself more. But I feel like if I leave my job, I will be letting people down (the residents I care for). I told myself that I need to do this for me and focus on my career. I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty for leaving them. I did apply for a job as a care manager through another company and interviewed with them back in late December. 

I have not heard back and I sent out an email for follow up. It makes me feel discouraged but at the same time, I‚Äôm trying not to jump to conclusions because of the recent holidays and people taking time off. 

I‚Äôve been on job sites looking for jobs with care manager title and I‚Äôve applied to every other one I saw and no response. Is there something wrong with me or am I overthinking this? (Chronic over thinker here)!"

2050,How do I make my resume catered to a more senior role?,jobs,"I accepted a job 5-6 months ago and it was a bait and switch. They told me it was a specific role and it ended up basically being customer service. I was previously in that industry for 2 years and want nothing to do with it anymore. It‚Äôs very soul sucking. 

The company is a complete dumpster fire and my team of 5 is constantly messaging each other and talking about how bad it is. Every person is talking about leaving and one person sent in their 4 week notice last week. I know another person is in talks for a new role in a different department. 

I‚Äôve been in the work force for about 3-3.5 years and I know I‚Äôm good at what I do. I want to try for a more senior position that‚Äôs below a manager role. 

The issue I am having is tailoring my resume to reflect what I bring to the table.  And I don‚Äôt know what to focus on. 

Some ideas I had would be how I onboarded and trained half the team about 3 weeks after I started and how I made sure they transitioned well. But I also want to focus on my retention percentages because I think that would be helpful. But I‚Äôm not sure. 

I‚Äôm in the tech space if that helps. I don‚Äôt have direct manager experience but I‚Äôve personally trained over 20 people from both my previous job and current role. And have always ended up being a senior without the title. 

Any advice for tailoring my resume is greatly appreciated! Or if you know any resources as well."

They were very forthcoming with questions and information and expectations. Not the usual evade and deny and hang up.

Out of curiosity, I drive to the town that it‚Äôs in. 

I ask around the locals if they‚Äôve heard of ‚Äú_________ organization‚Äù. No one has heard of them. I ask the neighbor of the building the organization is supposedly moving into, they have no idea who the organization is. 

The address on Google says one address, I drive to that address. It doesn‚Äôt match up. I look at the building photo and found an entirely different building address and look. The company site address says something a little different, I drive there and I finally see the building, but no sign like normal shops have. There are just renovation tools everywhere and guess what, my training is supposed to start in office tomorrow but I didn‚Äôt see any desks or any office space. It was a ghost town. 

This organization is claimed to have headquartered in this town for at least five years. You‚Äôd think locals know them or at least had heard of them. 

The only indication of the organization‚Äôs building was a small piece of tape on a mailbox that was easy to miss. Again, the place looked like honestly no one had been there for awhile. 

I looked over the offer letter. It‚Äôs legit. No misspellings or missed spaces. I got a I-9 form, pdf, handbook, w-2/w-4, all were grammatically correct and nothing that was out of the ordinary. I didn‚Äôt send anything digitally, as I was waiting to hand it to them in person. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm freaking out but I am.

I have worked at a restaurant for almost three months now as a hostess. When I got hired, I made it clear that I wanted to work as a server. They told me they just hired a new waitress and couldn't hire anyone new for three weeks, but after that I was set. It's been three months, and they just now asked my friend (who has been working there for six months) if she wanted to start training as a server. I get paid minimum wage ($14), while servers make $18 plus tips. I only get a small share of tips at the end of the day, \~$13 on a good day. I work two days a week for 5 hours, and sometimes less if it isn't busy. I really like the work environment, and I like working with my friend. I haven't really been able to connect with my coworkers as much as I'd like to because I don't speak much Spanish and they don't speak much English, so when my friend isn't there it's a little lonely. (This is just nitpicking, though). My problem is that I feel they have no intention of ever hiring me (or my friend) as a server, and that we do the same amount of work for less pay. I do the regular hosting duties, give menus, lead to tables, and give silverware. I also make the silverware, make to-go orders, clean, rearrange tables, and make coffee, smoothies, and drinks for guests. The only difference between my job and the servers is that I don't take orders (sometimes I even carry out food for them). I am not making as much as I wanted, am not working as often as I wanted (10 hours instead of the 20 I wanted), and don't see them hiring me as a server, if they've taken this long. My friend said she is quitting soon, and I think I will quit with her, but just want some other opinions or suggestions on what I should do."

My current job is for a smaller Homeowner's Club (20 regular employees, about half of them managers because we are so short-staffed and it's our off-season). They switched management a few months back, and we got a small raise. That said, there was no discussion about what my job duties were apparently. At first, this didn't occur to me. I figured they were asking me to step up to help them out, and that was fine. Now though, I'm getting burnt out and I've realized that they want to change my job position essentially. I took this job because it was workable with a college schedule - flexible hours and lots of downtime. I was mostly a warm body to greet people. Now, though, they're pushing for me to be a 9-5 administrative clerk. I like my job, I like the people, but I have no idea how to go to them and tell them this is not what I got hired for (and they have no idea what I was hired for. That became clear to me when they only started asking what time our shifts ran, what we did all day, why we couldn't just go home early, and why it was so important one of us was in our seat all day - the answer is because we unlock and set-up in the morning and lock and shut down everything at night. The job was essentially support staff) and that o can't keep doing this much stressful work given I'm still going to college and barely making rent each month. That was fine when I wasn't packed with duties and was essentially getting paid to do homework.
I'm sure my bosses will at least hear me out - they've been very good about listening when we say something, so far, but I have no idea how to even approach them with this. Any advice on how to even start this conversation because it needs to be had?

My friend who is a business analyst has told me my excel skills are more advanced than most analysts and saying I'm ""proficient in excel"" doesn't make me stand out. He's mentioned sharing some spreadsheets on a website in a portfolio, including some spreadsheets I've made outside of work (I have 3 that come to mind: a Pokemon EV training sheet, my personal budget sheet, and a guitar scales/music theory sheet). How would I go about sharing these on job applications, and would it even be useful to me? I feel these sheets don't highlight the excel work that I do at my job/what employers are looking for (SQL, PowerPivot, VBA).

This is a huge dataset that I don't have much experience analyzing at scale... either using python or database queries. The expectation from my boss is that now that I've set up the tools to gather this information, I should have the pieces of the puzzle to ""figure it out"". This is also a highly visible project that will be given visibility into the C-Suite... and I'm just stuck. This is also a time-critical need, so I don't have the luxury of self-learning on the go. 

I've worked with this boss before at a previous organization, and I was completely transparent with my skillset in the interview/resume. He is probably the reason why I'm there - he was a mentor at my previous position. Between those two facts, I assumed that he would have a good grasp on what my current capabilities are. This is just one instance of being ""talked up"" to myself and others when I don't have that experience, and I've had to correct those assumptions many times. 

Because of my role being more senior, I think that I may have ""bit off more than I can chew"". I've been able to deliver two major projects thus far, but this one I think is where the ""rubber will meet the road"". The organization doesn't really tolerate people who do not know what they are doing, and I think this project is what will end me. 

I've let him know of the difficulties that I am having, as well as giving him regular status updates on the actions I've taken to progress. However, he is very results oriented and just wants it ""done"". There are also many other ""Priority 0"" tasks that have been loaded onto me, and I'm just feeling crushed. 

Should I try to grunt through it, knowing that I'll be setting myself (and him) up for failure? Or should I have an open conversation with him about my capabilities, at the risk of being fired?

As far as savings go, I have enough to last for 6-9 months depending on how far I need to cut back, and I assume I can get another temporary job pretty quickly... what I would like to do is finish my formal education (another 2-3 semesters of work) to plug in the gaps.

What would you all do in this situation?"

At the same time, some of the best people I've ever met work there. I've been encouraged by pretty much every supervisor that's not a total arrogant SOB that I would make a good supervisor, and the thought does sound nice. The benefits are great and I have a guaranteed job and schedule, it's just the baggage that comes with it.
     However, I have been looking into the semi trucking career. It looks like something I really want to do, I've done soo much research into the career.

In my old department I had a 10% of my salary as my bonus (bonuses are awarded in February rather than end of year).

However, when I got the job offer on paper, it said ‚Äúyour current bonus percentage will not change‚Äù but did not have a % defined anywhere.

It showed up that I have some hearing loss, but I need to undergo objective hearing test in the start of February. I called that to the company and they said I have to provide the results, if I am healthy enough to work in the noisy environment. I still want to work there (it's a product packaging job).

A few days ago, I was at an interview in another company and again it's up to me. I asked them I would like to take some time to think about it. I'm not quite sure how to decide. I really prefer the first company, but there is uncertainty if I am fit for the job. In the case of second company, if they will not find somebody better in the meantime, all I have to do is say yes, but I think it's less fitting position for me so I don't know if I would be happy there.

There is also third company, but in this case I wait if will be invited for a job interview.

I was asking if it was possible to send me the terms under which I would be employed (that is, salary, vacation days,etc).

I'm looking for some advice. I'm wondering what sort of etiquette or rules there might be when contacting someone on LinkedIn. The situation is somewhat specific, but I'll try to keep it succinct. 

* A few years ago, I interviewed for a position with X company (and was connected with this recruiter). Made it through 2 interviews, a short assignment, and as far as I know was the 2nd top candidate. Bummer, but it happens.
* I've kept my eyes on other positions with this company, and a new job posting just popped up that fits my experience and skills really well.
* I'd love to reach out to this recruiter again to see if they would be willing to recommend me or push my application to better be seen, however, this person is no longer a recruiter with the company (they've since moved to another role, still within the same company).

My question is: would it still be ok to reach out to this former recruiter that I interviewed with and am connected to, or should I just cold-email another recruiter with the company?

Secondly, how is this message:

**Hi _________ - We met a few years ago during an interview for the position as _______ with _______ while you were a recruiter with them. Though I was unsuccessful after two interviews and a short assignment with you and _______, and I have avidly kept my eye on other opportunities with _________ that would be a good fit for my skills and experience. I have recently applied for the role of _________

I feel well-positioned for this role with over five years of experience in brand communications, coupled with work in film production, coordination, and campaign management (not to mention a nuanced knowledge of your company).

I‚Äôve submitted my resume and cover letter via _________ online application portal, and would love for the opportunity to discuss this role in more detail with your team. I‚Äôd be grateful if you could pass my message on to the relevant recruiter overseeing this position.

I've recently received a job offer contingent on a background check/credit check (which doesn't stress me) and a reference from my current boss.

Basically, the hiring manager said I should go ahead and talk to my current boss and say something along the lines of: ''I've recently accepted a position at X company, would it be ok if they called for references before the final offer?''.

Now, I really want this job since I've done multiple internships there before my current role and really like the company, benefits, and pension plan. Additionally, this would result in a 65% pay raise. The only concern is the situation it puts me in since I talk to my boss about accepting a position but I'm not giving my 2 weeks notice yet.

I even saw a job being re advertised that I interviewed for last year. So that's depressing. Not sure if I should reapply.

I'm extremely mature for my age and have been ready for work since I was around 12, and Now that I've sat all of my gcse's, I'm interested in working 10 times more. I'm just wondering if, if I take time off of school as there's no point me being there, could I get some form of licence/written consent for me to work more than 2 hours a night?

2139,Someone offered me $25/hr,jobs,"Someone DM'd me on Reddit and told me to contact the company he gave me. When I asked him what his job description, he said it was all about managing records.

I messaged the number on WhatsApp out of desperation, and someone ""interviewed"" me via chat. After answering a few questions, I was immediately accepted. He requested my personal information, including my name, location, phone number, ID, and a picture. Which I thought was fine at first, but when I asked what work I would do and when I would start, he said my job would be to transfer the money from the other companies to my PayPal account and then send it back to them using Bitcoin, and my salary would be based on my diligence. I thought about it for an a while. Because they sound unprofessional, I decided to end the conversation and delete all of my information.

Should I be worried?"
2140,I feel trapped. I don't know where else to go or what to pursue.,jobs,"TL;DR: I am sick of working retail as an Optician and I want to do something else. Are there any decent jobs you can think of that pay 20+ an hour and don't require you to go back to college. Even taking certification tests are fine.

I am 24 and I have been an Optician for the past six years. It's the first and only type of job I've ever had. Truth be told, I hate retail and I hate people. When I first decided to study Opticianry, I wasn't aware of how retail heavy it was, and I wasn't aware of what retail was like in general.

I recently got hired at a different Optical as a Lab Tech. I am still mostly on the sales floor but when I do get to be in the lab, I feel very happy, and I actually look forward to going to work. For the past week and a half, I've been more in the lab because our lab manager got sick. Now that they're feeling better, I have to go back to mainly being on the sales floor.

Being in the lab consistently like that was the best feeling I've had in six years of being an Optician. Now that I have to go back to being mostly on the sales floor, I feel anxiety and anger. You might think, why don't I just leave? When your job is as easy as selling glasses and making enough money to where your spouse doesn't have to work, you would stay too.

I feel trapped where I am, and I don't know what to do. I even have dreams about my job. I don't want to go back to college again so that's out the window. I am fine with taking courses or getting certified in something, just no colleges.

Now I would like to hear from all of you. Are there any jobs that pay in the ballpark of 20+ an hour and don't require me to have customer interaction?"

2149,Could somebody give me the rundown on ‚Äúoptional‚Äù teams meeting invites? Confused about meetings in new job,jobs,"I‚Äôm new in my role, I have been in this role a couple of weeks. I have not done much work, the majority of this past few weeks has been spent familiarising myself with the IT systems and learning the procedures of the job.

The role has plenty of meetings. In most of these meetings I sit in silence and say nothing as I do have absolutely nothing to say.

I‚Äôm a tad confused at the approach to meetings though. For a few of these meetings I receive a ‚Äúoptional‚Äù invite.

Now, my boss has always told me to attend these meetings when I ask. However, I‚Äôm wondering if I shouldn‚Äôt.

Firstly, I‚Äôm a tad confused as to the point of the optional. If I‚Äôm wanted at the meeting why bother with that? If I‚Äôm not then why invite me?

I did attend an optional meeting last week. I noticed that they were all joking when I entered, immediately went silent and started talking very seriously. Part of me feels that they weren‚Äôt expecting me, and were either talking about me or didn‚Äôt want me to hear what was said. After that most of them were tight lipped and were guarded with what was being said.

I am slightly confused at this approach as I am eventually going to be working with these people. So why am I not invited to all meetings. Even if only to sit and listen for guidance."

Please help me boundar-ize myself at work. Backstory~

I‚Äôm an analyst for a big company. We build things. I‚Äôve been working from home for 2 years, and the company  wants to start reintegrating into the office. Many people have explicitly voiced their concerns about their health &amp; how unnecessary it is for us to be in the office.

Of course, nobody cares.

Not just ‚Äúnobody‚Äù but like specifically my manager. I let him know that I‚Äôm experiencing symptoms &amp; he brushed it off very quickly. He then added that he, his wife, and his daughter have it &amp; ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù and that we‚Äôll all get over it soon.

Um. Speak for yourself? I have a fever 102 &amp; an insanely gross cough. COVID or not, I should not be around people.

My boss said that we‚Äôll be going back to the office twice a week, and every time I let him know I am not feeling well.. he adds in his unsolicited fatherly advice. I‚Äôm a 30 year old woman, I WANT MANAGERIAL ADVICE.

I asked if there is a company protocol for disclosing our status, and I‚Äôm honestly not sure if he doesn‚Äôt know or if he doesn‚Äôt want to tell me. 

I recently came back from a 6 week leave of absence for a miscarriage &amp; I still regret telling him that to this day. I didn‚Äôt want his pity, I legit thought I was legally obligated to. He called me to tell me his ex wife had 3 miscarriages, so he knows what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôm highly bothered because he never asked me about what I was going through, so he had no idea if he was saying the right thing. I was grieving, and my boss is not a man I feel comfortable talking about my personal life with. His story made me feel worse from specific things he said, and he was so proud of himself for sharing. He blamed his wife AND HER MISCARRIAGES for their divorce. He‚Äôs not the type of human being I want to work for, and I‚Äôm going to find better for myself.

This job gives me extreme panic attacks, and I‚Äôm in the process of looking for another job. No job, no manager how good the pay is, should ever make you feel as shitty as this.

Anyone know of really great resume writers?

Also.

I would love some advice on how to build boundaries at work? I don‚Äôt want to be involved in their happy hour events &amp; what not, but I also don‚Äôt want them to hate me basically lol. I‚Äôm very kind &amp; professional at work, I just don‚Äôt want to be friends with anyone there :("

I‚Äôm taking out loans to pay for school, so grad and undergrad loans will be deferred until 2025. No kids, live alone, long-term partner/plans to marry in 3-5 years, and I own my car. I want to do something now to grow my wealth by then but idk what to do. 

I wanted to buy a house to house hack but haven‚Äôt found a good deal for me yet and need a new realtor. I‚Äôm also a bit wishy washy, so getting into debt for the wrong property is a real and scary possibility. I‚Äôm trying to hold out, keep learning, be patient but I‚Äôm also a trauma survivor who was recently triggered by a neighbor and now desperately wants to move out. Right now I pay $1,079 but found a cheaper place to rent for $799 I plan to move to next month to get away and save money. I‚Äôve also found that properties in my area would run for just a few hundred extra bucks than I‚Äôm paying now, which I feel I could afford , especially with a roommate and ofc once married. Not looking for our forever home but obviously will be ready to live there until we marry and then sell, rent it out, or stay put. 

I work my full time job as a crisis call center specialist working 36 hours a week for $17 an hour and expect to eventually be given 3% annual raises ‚Äúprojected to start January 2022‚Äù. 

I work my second, temporary contract job as a rental assistance case manager 32 hours a week for $19 an hour but want to quit or possibly replace it with a super part job making around a lot less probably ($10-20). I start an unpaid grad school internship in two weeks, making replacing this job with something better a little difficult and honestly I‚Äôm tired lol and want to be off more. I ultimately want to quit due to differing Covid views and feeling that my health is at risk for no reason since they advertised the job as a WFH position but want me to come in to work near Covid positive ppl (albeit only once a week for 4 hours). 

I work my ‚Äúhalf‚Äù job at 6 hours a week for $12 an hour. 

My grad school loans cover tuition and living costs, so I am able to save my income. I have been spending a lot and have had to tap into my income account twice but have saved around $17,000 and counting. The $17,000 is in an account with 3.00% APY. And I have an Acorns account but have been advised by Redditors to switch to Fidelity. 

What else should I be doing? Would quitting be immature or a mistake financially? Should I quit and live on my savings until finding a good fit to replace my second job or begin door dashing instead of getting into another commitment?"

2205,Internal Recruiter Not Responding After Offer is Extended,jobs,"I applied to a large defense company in the New England area and had a recruiter reach out to me asking if they could set up some time to talk about a role I interviewed for. I emailed back with days I was available and the best number to reach me. No call, but I got an offer letter the next day. I then emailed her back with a counter offer to bring the salary up to market rate and a week went by without a response. 

Is this level of communication normal for recruiters with 5+ years of experience or are they just trying to spook me so I take the original offer or am I missing something else?"
2206,Is a 60mile commute to work worth 16/hr?,jobs,"I finally found a job within my career field it‚Äôs 60mile commute or 1hr 5min.

I drive a 2010 Dodge Charger

Is this job gonna be worth it? Or should I move on."
2207,Question about current employer being contacted by prospective employer + general advice,jobs,"So I joined Company A in November knowing I wasn't going to be there for a long time, but I needed work in the industry relevant to what I studied/trained for so I took the job. I am wanting to apply to a job at Company B but I'm hesitant to list my current supervisor and his phone # at Company A in fear that if I don't get the job from Company B, Company A will start giving me shit end of the stick for finding out I'm already looking at other jobs. It doesn't help that I've only been at Company A for two months. 

I know it's technically illegal for my employer to give me less hours or to hold it against me for applying to a new or better job, but I have a feeling it happens all the time regardless and I'm really not trying to burn any bridges. I really like Company A and all the people I work for and my supervisor is cool, but it's just a step below what I actually want to do so I don't want to get on their bad side if it turns out I end up having to stay here for a little longer than intended. Also chances are my supervisor probably wouldn't hold it against me, but I'm just not sure and don't want to risk it if turns out I might have to be here for awhile. It's a medium sized company and I'm still on my 90 day probation period, so it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but I just don't really know. 

I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this. I know sometimes they ask if they can contact your current supervisor and you can say no, but Company B does not have that option in their application, it just outright asks for their contact information.

Lastly to complicate matters a little more, I applied to and just did an interview with Company C in which I did not have to give my current supervisors contact information, with Company C ultimately being my #1 choice and a dream job with a substantial pay increase (130%) that I would take right away. But if I could not get on with Company C, I would be happy to be at Company B... only because Both B and C are actually in the industry I want to be, where as A is a similar industry but not exactly the same and has lesser pay. I just took the job at Company A to get my feet wet and get some relevant experience to help me with future applications.

So really I'm not sure what I should do and I'm hoping someone could give me some advice. Before I decided to switch careers and retrain/acquire new skills and join Company A, I worked at the same place for 10+ years so I am not at all experienced with doing this. Right now my gut is telling me to just abandon applying for Company B and stay with A until I hear back from C... but I would really like to go to B if C doesn't workout while at the same time, not piss off A if neither B nor C workout. 

I'm starting to think that I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and hope that my current employer A doesn't take it personally, but I don't feel confident about that at all for some reason. I feel like it's going to suddenly shine a light on the fact that I never intended to be apart of A for more than 6 months, which is true, but I would rather get a new job and then split, not be in that weird middle ground where they now know I'm trying to leave and I just end up getting treated poorly by everyone because they know I already have one foot out the door.

I realize this post is really vague but any advice would tremendously appreciated... Thank you."
2208,Can any ( junior) random team member send a rejection email to applicant?,jobs,"I applied for a job and the interview process almost went for 3 months - they were slow. I was given a task to complete in the final stage and they said that they will follow up with me where I'll get the opportunity to explain how I completed the task. All the way through, I was managed and interviewed by the HRs and the Hiring Manger.
 
Everything was going well until I receive an abrupt email from a random team member ( he holds the same entry level position as to what I applied for) that he did not like my task and they  won't progress with my application. The HRs and execs who were all in communication with me until now weren't even cc'ed in that email.

I know I should simply move on and not have any hopes but do you think it is normal to receive a rejection email by any team member who is not an HR and who wasn't even a part of the interview process all the way through?"

2211,How early in the interview process can I ask for a company's compensation target for a role?,jobs,"I'm potentially looking for a change, and have applied liberally to a lot of positions on LinkedIn. I've had a decent response rate with recruiters/companies reaching out to set up time to connect or interview with the team.

Some recruiters are direct. They ask for my target comp range (and pro-tip: 80% of the time, if you redirect the question back to them and ask what their company's target range is for that role, they'll let you know). 

In other cases, I speak with a recruiter, I then speak with someone on that team... and find out the salary/comp is where I am now, or in one case, 15% less, for a role of the same title.

**How early in the interview process can I ask for a company's compensation target for a role?**

I have a masters and a bachelors in environmental sustainability. The topic and issues still interest me a lot, And I finally got a job in my field about 6 weeks ago. I do not like it. Everyone is super nice, I‚Äôm qualified, it‚Äôs a relatively chill work environment, but I don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt like my benefits, the work doesn‚Äôt interest me like I expected it to, and I hate that I can‚Äôt work remote anymore. I know I‚Äôd get used to not being remote anymore, but why should I? I liked being able to clean the house on a break or meeting during the day, I liked having time to workout on my lunch hour, I liked having the energy to go run errands after I logged off, I liked seeing my partner more often and being at home with my pets. 

My pay is relatively the same, I was actually offered a 15% increase at the new job, but the insurance is so goddamn expensive I‚Äôm only pulling about $80 more a check. So that doesn‚Äôt really mean anything to me. 


My old job was pretty slow, and I felt bored and unchallenged, but in retrospect I could‚Äôve been teaching myself new skills to make advancement for myself since it was a big company, or even earning money on the side, or just playing around with hobbies. My old boss told me when I left that I could come back if I wanted to. I‚Äôm very seriously considering it now. 


I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just homesick for the familiarity of my old job or I‚Äôm realizing the grass isn‚Äôt always greener and that maybe I‚Äôm just one of those people who has degrees she isn‚Äôt going to use.

2215,How do you manage 3+ rounds of interviews while employed full time?,jobs,"Im currently a paralegal working at a firm I hate and am at my wits end with. I was the receptionist for ~6 months and was promoted to paralegal just under 3 months ago. I have been applying around because I cant stand going into work every day to just be underpaid in a hostile work environment with very low levels of training and a high expectation as to my output. 

I have been through 2 rounds of interviews for another position at a firm that wants to train me and seems like a better fit. My 2nd interview was over zoom on friday. I initially was just going to take a sick day but it ended up snowing a solid 4 inches. My boss wanted us all in office anyways. I overthought it and figured that if I said I was sick on such a bad weather day after being told we had to come in id look like a liar anyways. I made the mistake of just saying I was going to take a personal day because they hadn‚Äôt plowed by me and I didnt feel safe travelling which, if I wasnt already trying to get out of work, would have been true. My office manager essentially pushed me into come in for the second half of the day because ‚Äúthe weather would be fine by then!‚Äù which was after my interview so I went. I had the time to take off but apparently my boss was making it known to everyone who came in how angry he was at everyone who didnt show up, so thats why she was pushing me to come in. I wanted to give in my resignation letter at the end of the day because the situation had me so angry but of course, the a hole left by 2pm :)

The last interview is in person monday morning. Im 95% certain I have the job.

I dont know how to get out of working monday. I am open to just emailing a resignation letter as im not planning on giving two weeks anyways and already emptied my desk. At the same time, im nervous about putting all my eggs in one basket. How do people make the multi round interviews work and what can I possibly do to make monday work? Im not sure if theres really any way around just quitting for me at this point."

2218,"""You're lazy for wanting an easy job""",jobs,"No tf I'm not üòÇ why would I want to work, slave away, break my back for some company? Yeah shit like warehouse and construction is cool, it pays good when you have a few years with it but even then you're still working a lot to make that good money. 

People equate working alot with making good money and being a hustla. Where that's true that the work ethic often times bring more money since you're working longer and harder, it shouldn't have to be that way. Yes we should put in our work to make a living and I'm trying to get that mentality right, but us dedicating our whole lives to it is bullshit. 

Instead of helping people with a little sustainable income, we're spending that money on the military and government corporate funding. And don't get me wrong, I respect the military (I have family members and friends in it) and what they do, but if we took that money and the world would just calm down and quit beefin all the time then we'd be good and able to. But that's not human nature, there's always going to be drama. So that's not realistic. 

Some countries could pull it off but those countries don't need the strongest military because they don't fuck with people and people don't fuck with them. But that's a different story. 

And for us parents. I understand all sides of it. Unfortunately nowadays even when both parents work it could get difficult and that's not good for the kid never really being with their parents like that. If you're a single parent it's just extra. 

And then all the money paid in taxes (government tax but also the taxes paid on every day things, including personal services), they have a difficult time actually helping people when they need it. And that includes low income families It. seems you have to be a single parent just to get some help. They won't really help married couples or just regular couples (unless you go to court for it because any parent that's on public assistance has to sign a thing to allow the government to go after the other parent for child support). 

So we dedicate so much of our lives to be away from our family, friends, having a life, some people work 4 jobs just to make it. 

Then you open your own under the table business because the government doesn't need to know everything you do and tax everything you have, and you're given so many obstacles. Whether it's illegal or legal, it's gonna get fucked with. You sell weed and you're some shitty low life criminal. You do some blue collar shit and they sweep in. And yeah sometimes people do need that cuz there's some real shit people out here doing shit things and exploiting people that are just trying to work. But some of the time, especially when it comes to selling shit like tree, they need to back up. 

So most alternative ways to make money are off the table unless you don't care or you conform to what the society standard is, which is to get a regular job and slave away at it. Unless you're fortunate enough to have a good paying job for minimal work and effort. Which brings me to my whole point... where they at tho??"

That doesn't help me narrow things down at all. Yes, it knocks some off when I make the distance shorter, but still gives 8k listings that are completely irrelevant to what I searched for. Is there something I am missing to prevent it from going outside of my search parameters and ONLY give me jobs or companies specifically for what I searched for?"

I have been working in a technical sales position for the same company, well known and respected in the material handling industry, for the past 7ish years. Currently make $115k base and total comp last year was right under $170k. Job and manager treats me GREAT and I enjoy my coworkers and manager. I basically do what I want because my manager trusts me and we have a equal respect for each other. I typically get recruiters contact me all the time and I usually just brush them off. Recently, I had a recruiter call and I was extremely transparent in how happy I was and my current compensation last year, which was the best year I‚Äôve ever had. He said he understood and still wanted to submit me to the hiring manager which I was fine with and truly thought my salary would end all conversations. Fast forward, I‚Äôve had a few talks with the EVP of the new company and he mentioned that he wasn‚Äôt afraid of my salary and told me that he would give me my total compensation as a base salary + I would continue to get commissions. The new company is a smaller company and doesn‚Äôt offer all the types of technologies that my current company has. Current company is stable and I have job security. New company seems stable and has been in business since 1977 but recently acquired a smaller company in my area, which is why this position is open. New position would be a step up and be a ‚Äúdirector‚Äù. Crazy to even consider not taking this position, if offered, just because of loyalty to existing company and security?"

2228,Deciding whether to leave current job for a 6 month contract to hire job?,jobs,"Ya I've been at my job around 6 months. It's a 2 year contract job that pays 42k. It, started off ok. But, it got annoying fast because my boss would pull us into tese long 45 min to 1hr long meetings everyday to explain things that could take 5 to 10 mins to explain. Then 1 day I was literally the only one working and it was getting near the end of the day. He pulled me into a meeting and asked what I was working on. Then he said I wasn't saying much and went into my stats of how many tickets I did that day and looked into what I put on my tickets etc. Then sometimes he'll email us these random excel projects out of nowhere. I've had worse jobs before, just seems like he's making it more annoying and harder than it needs to be.

I like the job because I don't have to take a whole lot of calls during the day and I have some downtime occasionally though to study for more IT certs. Whereas, my last IT job was constant calls 50-60 a day and chats as well. 

I'm debating looking for other jobs, but idk if it would be a bad idea to levae considering I've only been here 5 months.

I had one offer for a 6 month contract to hire job for 25 an hour. But, idk if it's worth it to take it? I would have to wait 60 days for health insurance to start and the health insurance is 125 biweekly, compared to 65 biweekly at my current job. So, after taxes and insurance the 10k salary gain would go down to 6000. Also, the other job sounds more stressful because they said I would be taking 40-45 calls a day and doing chats. And getting hired on depends on my performance metrics and they said they preferred an average call time of 13 minutes.

So, should I take this job, or keep my current job and keep looking?"

Everything sounds great so I went ahead and applied, only problem is the PM shift starts @4pm and ends 12:30am. It‚Äôs not an issue for me since it seems the role would only entail me working Friday and Saturday, but since Friday I already work from 8-5 is there a way I should approach the situation in the case I get an interview in regards to Friday‚Äôs shift? 

Do you think it would be plausible to ask the supervisor where I work if I can leave early and take a 30min lunch instead of the hour lunch I usually get the days they need me at this new opportunity? Or to not bite the hand that feeds me, should I ask interviewer if I can start Friday‚Äôs shift at 5pm? 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I did mention to my supervisor earlier this week that I intended to seek part time work on the weekends since I could put my time to good use &amp; since we are short staffed atm I doubt I shot myself in the foot since she didn‚Äôt respond negatively to my comment."

2244,Got hired and called to work today but I don‚Äôt think I still want the job. What do I do?,jobs,"Okay so I got called into work at a retail as a part-time sales associate, I was excited at first (they called me on Tuesday) and now I don‚Äôt feel like going at all. They asked if I could come in today, for 3 hours, just to fill up some paperwork and feel the ambience of the work environment.

I drive, but I don‚Äôt have a car yet. And it takes 30 mins for me to get to the job, minus the traffic. *(If you live in California going to the Bay area, you know the traffic can be bad on Altamont Pass.)* and taking Uber or Lyft there costs about $60, back and forth. I can‚Äôt afford that if I were to work everyday for a few hours.

Here‚Äôs my thing: should I call them and be straightforward that I‚Äôm not interested in the job anymore? I also feel it was a bit ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù that they just called me, no emails whatsoever that I got hired. (Maybe just a personal preference) but any advice would be helpful. TIA."
2245,Placed on a PIP after 5 months into the job,jobs,"Like the title says, I was placed on a performance improvement plan 5 months into my first job after college. I was told it‚Äôs due to many small mistakes I‚Äôve made (which my other team members have done as well. Even the ones that have been in the company for 2+ years). My manager made sure to list specific examples - which I took accountability for. I believe these small mistakes are due to poor training and management since I‚Äôm not the only one making those mistakes. Unfortunately, I just happened to be the perfect victim for a manager on a power trip because of my inexperience in the work force. I was really naive as to what a PIP really is and thought my boss genuinely wanted to help me..

The first two weeks after signing the PIP were HELL. I was being nitpicked for EVERYTHING. Not only that, I was made feel stupid for asking relevant questions even though asking questions/reaching out is one of the items listed on the PIP. For one instance, one of my colleagues had a question which I also didn‚Äôt know the answer to. I decided to go ahead and ask my bosses to which one of them replied ‚Äúyou should already know the answer to this, i shouldn‚Äôt have to tell you.‚Äù With the pressure of knowing my job is on the line, I couldn‚Äôt help but to go into the restroom and cry. I felt so stupid for even reaching out. I quickly realized that it was a relevant question because I wasn‚Äôt the only one who had this question. Being treated like that just comes with the territory of being PIPed. 

Despite all this, I have still been trying my best (while also actively searching for new jobs). I noticed after the first two weeks, they stopped picking on me as much. I was happy cause I thought that meant they noticed me trying. I also noticed my manager didn‚Äôt schedule a follow-up meeting (which is listed on the PIP, we‚Äôre supposed to have follow up meeting every 3 weeks to discuss improvement progress). I really thought they were going to schedule since on their agenda from two weeks ago they had written ‚Äúset up last two follow up meetings.‚Äù After reading that I lost all hope of keeping this job but still continued trying.

Well, turns out they stopped picking on me because one of my coworkers is leaving the company. He put his two weeks last week and just announced it to  team. I also believe this completely blindsided them based on their attitude when sharing these news. I had to hold in a chuckle because after going through  those first two weeks of hell, seeing them come down from a power trip was satisfying. They‚Äôve been treating me better because they know they can‚Äôt lose two employees (we‚Äôre a small team, two people leaving would only leave them with 3 people on the team). Wanted to share this because I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about being PIPed. I was extremely embarrassed and just need to share this."
2246,Need Advice On my job status,jobs,[removed]
2247,Should I job hunt before asking to WFH?,jobs,"Overall should I find a new position in my new town before asking if I can just WFH for my current company or should I just ask to WFH first and see what happens?

Hey all I could really use some advice on how to go forward with my career.

I'm a drafter at a small firm that I really love but unfortunately  I need to move back to my hometown for family reasons.
I would love to just WFH at my current firm but I'm not sure how to go about approaching it.

If I find a new position I would have leverage and a safety net which would obviously be good.
But it's also a lot of work and not great to apply for new jobs just to rejecting it.

If I ask to wfh and they say no then the cats out of the bag about my move and what if they fire me then?

I'm a great employee I work hard and it shows, at one point my boss said I'm the best hire he's ever made. However I have a problem being late to work which I know is bad and works against me.
I don't think my company would fire me because I'm very useful and they can't really afford to lose a good employee right now with how busy it is. And if they say no I could spend my remaining months left training a new hire as well as finding a new job 

My company isn't big on wfh we only did it for 3 months in 2020 but it is entirely possible to do my job from home well.
They are just old school. But I feel with my work history it would be worth it to the company to let me do it.

Any advice? Is it worth the risk of asking them first to possibily save stress and trouble of a job hunt? Or is it to risky and I should have a back up? 

Any advice is appreciated!"

2250,I hate my job and want to leave but also feel guilty about it,jobs,"I've been at my current job for about 5 months now and everyday I want to send in my two weeks. The job itself is stressful; I'm a CNA at a mental hospital. Almost everyday I'm yelled at or have to yell at people and have to put hands on with some patients who are actively trying to harm myself or others. Honestly, I can handle that kind of stuff at my job. The worst part is that the facility I work at is so understaffed that more often than not I'm working multiple 16 hour shifts in a row, usually a minimum of 60+ hours a week. During the work week I get barely any sleep between shifts, and then when I get a day off I sleep for half the day just to catch up.

This job is making me very unhealthy. I eat like shit because I don't feel like I have time to make proper food. Just fast food and gas station food has been my diet for the last 5 months. I want to find a nice job in Criminal Justice because that's what I have a degree in, but I need to exercise and get in shape for that and as it stands right now, I have no time to better myself, and on my days off I'm just exhausted and have no motivation to do anything good for myself. I'm also angry all the time and will snap at my gf or my family when they talk to me or try to give me sympathy. I hate what this job has made me become, but I still feel guilty about wanting to leave because I really like the people that I work with.

I've applied at other places and have a phone interview with one coming up, but have nothing concrete lined up. I've never quit a job for mental health reasons before, but I'm seriously considering doing that in this case because I can just feel myself spiraling down as each month passes and getting very depressed. What are your thoughts? Is leaving a job for mental health reasons a good idea?"

I'm an inventory control tech for a large cold storage company and lately my coworkers have been curious on how much I make since they're concerned about themselves not getting an increase after being there for a year. So this has made me curious as to how much other ICT make in other companies so I can build up reasons as to why I should get a raise once I reach my 1 year mark. 

This is my current work situation: I have already been told that my department is the highest paying so was pretty stoked to get hired on so quickly. I'm learning that this job has a lot of walk outs so it makes me think just passing my probation period is enough of a reason to ask for a raise. I have also done a lot more in a short span of time while being trained and  my work environment is somewhat of a hazard since we work with heavy equipment and in below freezing temps. I'm also working the overnight shift as well.

Looking forward to what others have as input."
2254,Has anyone ever left a corporate job to go back to retail/food?,jobs,"Hi, I‚Äôm a former employee of a recruiting agency and it was my best highest paying job but I unfortunately had to take a break for mental health reasons because of the pandemic.

Well I‚Äôve been recently trying to get back into working and have been getting no luck with corporate jobs. I feel that I‚Äôm qualified because I have 3 years of experience but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. The postings even get reuploaded every week showing they still haven‚Äôt hired anyone but all I get is ghosted.

Anyways: because it‚Äôs been a month or so with no luck, I‚Äôve applied to a fast food job once again just to be able to pay the bills and I feel like I‚Äôm cheating myself. I landed an interview nearly instantly after applying. 
It‚Äôs guaranteed I get the job and the max pay (not much) that comes with it because of my experience.

I only have a certificate in Business Enterprise and it is not the full thing, which is at least 4 years of studying in college, instead my one is 2 years.

My English is probably proficient, but in no way fluent. In other words I'm not good in speaking.

2261,My paystub decreased with the new year? Can someone please explain,jobs,"Hi!

I received a promotion/raise in July 2021 with my company. My latest pay stub came in and is about $150 less than all my previous pay stubs.  I checked my paystubs and it looks like the decrease is because the federal withholding, medicaid, and other federal tax deductions increased while my overall pay stayed the same.

 I'm pretty clueless when it comes to finance and taxes and everything, is this because of the high inflation rates I hear about? Essentially since I didn't get an end of the year adjustment it seems like I got a pay decrease instead. Has anyone else seen this?

Thanks for any input!!"
2262,"I've been job hopping too frequently, how do I fix up my resume?",jobs,"So, I have had a bit too many jobs in the past couple of years. I was living in a different area a couple of years ago and was with a company at a job I liked for 4 years. I quit because of personal circumstances that forced me to move almost an hour away and I do not have a car and the job was not really paying me enough to be able to get one so it ended up turning out that half my paycheck a week was going to transportation costs. I tried to stay there as long as possible, gave my two weeks and didn't really want to leave but I did because I had to. I left on really good terms thankfully. Since I've moved, job opportunities have been horrible. I've dealt with really disrespectful managers and being heavily overworked and underpaid. Jobs that were really ruining my mental health, and I don't believe that I should have to be thinking about killing myself just because of a job. So, I quit them when I just couldnt take it anymore. Most of them without notice, and one if them was a temporary job. I haven't been able to keep any of these jobs for more than 6 months max. Most of them are not on my resume, just the most recent one and the one that I stayed at 6 months. I really know I can and will stay at a job that respects me and treats me the way an employer should, but now it's starting to affect my job search. It looks like I've just been job hopping and not caring about these companies, but every one of them I start off excited and ready to work and stay, but it gets ruined when im treated horribly, disrespected, etc. And I dont wanna deal with that. The job I kept for 4 years, from the start they treated me right and cared and I even was promoted and was given rewards for going the extra mile to make sure things got done. I want to show an employer that I can be like that with the position I'm applying for but they mostly focus on the shitty, low skill, less than a year long jobs I have. How can I work on this?"

There's no actual valuable human connection, just the soulless analysis of whether the other person can increase your bank account balance in the end. To me, networking is pointless because I know I'll never trust anyone I ""connect"" with. They'll never trust me because we both know what the point of such a website is.

2272,How do I get my CEO to give a shit?,jobs,"I work for a small organization and our CEO is very young, new to the role, and has spent the last 5+ years working as a mid-level employee here. I'm close friends with the CEO too, I do think they are a great person, but they don't have the knowledge or will power to make this business work the way it needs to. 

Currently, 3 of our 5 services are completely down, employees are leaving every week, and we haven't reached out to our partners to renew our contracts like we needed to. Customers are still complaining about basic things for the past 6 months, but we just keep giving out half assed excuses at this point. 

The real issue is the CEO's eyes are not on the ball and everyone is running around like headless chickens. The new CEO doesn't realize that as CEO they need to be engaged all the time, the business is their responsibility because they took on the role. But, instead of doing work they are just jet setting, taking lots of PTO, and ignoring messages for days at a time.

Then some of the CEO's new VPs have given them a lot of really fucked up ideas like ""it's fine if we lose 10 employees a month, we can hire 12 employees next time"" and ""we can pay less money for the same work and not expect diminishing returns, we just need to be more forceful"" or even ""we don't need to be looking for new opportunities to expand our business, they will just come to us naturally if we keep doing what we're doing (which has proven to be 150% wrong)."" 

I feel like the organization is falling apart day by day and it makes me really sad because I deeply care about our mission. I've been here for 3 years now and I've seen so much progress, so many amazing people come on board, and so many other reputable organizations give us a bump that I know we can make it big, but we can't do that if the CEO doesn't do his job. 

I'm leaving the job now, I found a new one because of these problems, but I know I will stay connected to this org as a kind of consultant. I want to make sure things are good going forward, but I'm not sure how. 

So what can I do to make the CEO realize that the job they took requires them to work 10x as hard as they're currently working?"

I was laid off from my job on Friday, which I'm not angry/upset about. I have a BA in psychology which I intend on never working in psychology again. This weirdly all came at a good time as I being my dual MBA and MS in Data Science on Monday. To make a long story short, I was laid off because the accommodations I need post surgery and for my chronic medical condition were not able to be given at my job. 

The program is accelerated so a semester worth of work is crammed into 7 weeks. On a full time basis, the program takes about a year to complete. On a part time basis, I'm looking at about 18-20 months. 

Right now, I'm undecided if I want to take advantage of FT jobs as the job market is so hot. I do have some WFH job applications out there for things such as data entry, data analysis, and customer service. I just want to ""get my foot in the door"" in companies that are more business related. However, I'm finding it tough as all of my background is in psych/social work.  I'm also finding I'm under qualified for a lot of the jobs for not having a bachelors in business. 

On the other hand, I think it might be wise to continue working PT in the restaurant industry and focus on graduate school full time. Financially, I am fine either way. 

Is this a ""right answer"" to this?"

2287,How to get through period of high turnover?,jobs,"A bit of background: I joined my current company about 6 months ago. They had been acquired by a major corporation in early ‚Äò21, and were/are going through major integrations and re-orgs. 

There have been no mandatory layoffs, as the company will remain a standalone division of the parent organization. In my time here, there have been countless coworkers leaving voluntarily. No surprise during a major transformation like this, but it still makes me feel as if I joined a sinking ship. 

I haven‚Äôt gone through the meat of an acquisition in previous jobs, so looking for advice on how I can put this into perspective. My job pays well and has good work/life balance, and my team is cool. So I‚Äôm not necessarily looking to jump ship either.

2288,What can I do with my useless college diploma?,jobs,"Hi everyone, I really need to speak my mind on this one, because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this.

I finished a program called Theatre Arts - Technical Production, with the intention of being a set builder/carpenter in the supposed booming Toronto film industry. I graduated in April of 2021, and haven't found any work since then. I'm on the call list for two separate unions, and again, haven't been provided any promising leads. I currently work retail, to support myself, but I'm increasingly dissatisfied with my life. I don't have a university degree that (let's face it) will open far more doors than a two-year college diploma that is highly specific. And I just heard that major production companies are pulling projects out of Canada because the American film unions are frustrated that everything is being outsourced here-meaning ***even less*** work.

Setting aside any construction/carpentry jobs, what would you guys say my career options are? The longer I wait, the less enthused I am to do carp/construction, and pursue this dissipating industry. I'm leaning more towards a stable 9-5 job. Maybe one in an office setting. 

I'm not suggesting I'll get a 60k a year starting office job, but if I could get something entry-level, that pays a bit more than minimum wage, I'd be more than happy. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for me, or potential paths to pursue. I'm really unhappy as of late and desperately want a fresh, new start.

Thank you so much."

I work alone in my section and a few times people have pointed out to me I have made a mistake, but most times noone says a word until days later or anything at all. Im just looking for any type of advice on how to become a consistent worker or to achieve consistent results. My shifts are 12 hours and they switch from day to night. Im really struggling with this aspect.  What type of practices have other people put into place when they have started at a new place?"
2290,How should I negotiate my first promotion? (1st year office assistant ),jobs,
2291,Would you rather have a job that pays less but has unlimited paid time off or a job that pays more with standard 10 day vacation?,jobs,"My current job gives me unlimited paid time off. In 2021, I took so many vacation days (probably 30+) without interfering with productivity. My company also never gave me a hard time for it or made me feel guilty which I am beyond grateful for. However, I‚Äôve been rethinking about my future and I‚Äôm not sure if this is the place for career development. It‚Äôs sort of becoming a toxic environment that I‚Äôm not happy to be in. Also I‚Äôm getting paid below industry standards with 7+ years of experience and I don‚Äôt get the appreciation and recognition I deserve.

I‚Äôve been interviewing with another company and I‚Äôm 99% they‚Äôre going extend an offer with a higher title and more money. They moved extremely fast with the interview process and I have rare skills the industries are looking for. All the people I interviewed with were so lovely and experts in my field who I can learn so much from. But for the sake of my mental health, I don‚Äôt think I can go back to the standard 10 days per year. This is just my assumption. Of course I‚Äôll wait it out and see what‚Äôs included in the offer package but I‚Äôm curious what would you do?"
2292,How do you know when it‚Äôs time to leave your current job?,jobs,"All of the jobs I‚Äôve had and left, I left because I was moving, starting school, or graduating. All of these were life circumstances. Outside of absolutely hating your boss / job, what would be reasons that you‚Äôd leave?
I‚Äôve been at the same company (different roles and departments) for the four years since I graduated and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs time to move on."
2293,How long to stay in a supervisor position before going to a different place?,jobs,"I‚Äôm new to being a manager. It‚Äôs been about 4 months. The reason I wanna go to a different place is because it‚Äôs night shifts. 
And also. I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúachievements‚Äù I can list on my resume as a manager. Most of the time it‚Äôs doing basic paperwork and ensuring people do their jobs safely including disciplining when necessary"

2297,Salaried vs Hourly,jobs,"When I started out of college at my current job I had an entry level job that was hourly. Any position above mine was salaried and after two years I finally moved up. 

Being a salaried employee was absolutely terrible. I was working about 60+ hours a week and extremely unhappy. The position I had didn't have us clock in since we were salaried and there was no schedule to show how many hours I was working. The only way I knew I was working this much was for two weeks I tracked my own hours.

I got so unhappy with how much I was working I asked for my old hourly job back. They gave it to me yet I am still doing all the task I did in my salaried position along with my other job. 

I know for sure I'm underpaid. The only difference is now when I work over 40 hours I'm getting paid overtime. 

I am ready to look for a new job at a new company.  Most jobs I have looked into are salaried as well. How can I make sure I am not making the same mistake twice? I don't want to work 20 days straight just to have a weekend off and do it all over again.  I understand the occasional need to work over if there are deadlines but weekly isn't something I can handle again. Can I negotiate an hourly wage even if they are a salaried position? Are there any labor laws to help me if I am continually asked to work multiple days straight? I live in NC if that helps any."
2298,Confused about how virtual interview sign ups on indeed work,jobs,"Hi, I have virtual interview scheduled. At the time I signed up I was #2 to have signed up if indeeds sign up numbers were correct. Now it says 207 sign ups and I'm confused. Employer is only interviewing for half a day with slots only on one day only but somehow they have 207 sign ups? I have never had an interview this way and am relatively new to indeed. Does that mean there are actually 207 people signed up and scheduled to be interviewed or is that just people who expressed interest?"
2299,Anyone else reaping the benefits from people leaving their jobs?,jobs,"My industry is experiencing an acute shortage of qualified people to fill positions.  I started getting messages from recruiters with positions at way higher salaries last year.  I interviewed with some of them and got an offer for 45%.  When I gave notice my current job matched it immediately.  From August to the end of the year and my bonus, it has been shocking but good.

I hope everyone is experiencing the same."

2304,Would you answer questions for previous employers?,jobs,"I‚Äôm asking because my last day of work was yesterday on Friday. I quit after I was promoted without the title change and was doing managerial work leading my peers, despite being a recent college grad at the company for several months. 

I established and led a majority of the new processes, and my transition plan documentation has around 30 pages, but I just feel awful about the way I handed off yesterday. I was escorted out of the building 2 hours sooner than they had told me, so my documentation was incomplete. The most important sections were unfinished and some minor files I promised simply aren‚Äôt there, and I‚Äôm the only person who holds this knowledge. 

This company is a client of the new place I‚Äôll be joining next week, so I feel even more horrible, and I don‚Äôt want this entire documentation to be viewed as a negative reflection of myself nor my work.

Should I text my coworkers any quick pieces of missing information, or wait until they reach out? The company has a notorious reputation, but I have a good relationship with my team, so I‚Äôm conflicted.

Would you go out your way to ensure success of your former team?"

2306,My new job is starting to suck,jobs,"So first off, our manager screwed up our PTO for Christmas Eve and NYE so we had to go to the HR building and waited 2 hours, the checks still weren‚Äôt printed. The manager didn‚Äôt even apologize or say sorry, even made a joke and laughed about it. 

Secondly, I‚Äôve come to find out that the whole ‚ÄúWFH Thurs and Fridays‚Äù was only available for a small portion of last year. So basically it‚Äôs not going to be an option. 

The job is beyond boring and the expectations for me being a new hire are just a lot more than I anticipated. I need the experience and have a decent track record, but so far the first impression hasn‚Äôt been good.
We have multiple Teams call meetings everyday, which are pointless. I have no idea why we can‚Äôt WFH, but I‚Äôm thinking of asking soon. 

How long should I tough it out here?"

Did the in-person hiring event, drug test, background check, I already had a shift selected about 2 weeks out. Waiting on my drug test etc. and I get an email saying we're sorry, your start shift is full. Uhh, okay. Go online, there are no shifts available for that job. Contact them and they tell me it's because ""our hiring needs changed"" and to keep checking online for new shifts to open up.

Is this their way of rejecting me, or... do I just keep trying? I feel like I'm chasing a carrot here."
2310,Employer whited out my state W2...,jobs,"My company has done a few questionable things since I started there, one of them being that when I filled out my state W2 with 2 allowances, the HR person said ""Oh, you don't really need to do that..."" and literally whited out the form. What the fuck? Is that normal? I didn't want to say anything at the time because I wanted the job, but now I'm kind of putting all the pieces together."
2311,Wanting to quit my job,jobs,"I seriously want to quit my current job, my supervisor is the most narcissistic person I have ever meet and I'm miserable at my workplace. I noticed 2 months in that I was uncomfortable with the way she handles things and treat everyone but I thought it would get better. She litterally yells and scream at people at times. She is super disrespectful. I want to quit but my job search isn't going so well at the moment.

I really don't want to quit without having another job lined up but I'm finding it more and more hard to stay there. I don't know what to do."
2312,Deciding between bigger and smaller company,jobs,"I am a master in Computer Science and Mathematics (graduated 3 months ago) with 0 years of work experience. I have been looking for a programmer job.

I applied for a position at a relatively small company roughly 3 months ago. This was the first position I've applied for since it suited me the best out of all of which I've seen so far. It was even somewhat related to work I've done in my master thesis. To make it clear, the position required at least 3 years of experience so I sent an open request stating I liked the position. The interviews didn't go great and I honestly didn't expect to get an offer. And I still didn't get it, but HR called and informed me they would want to see me in their team. They also said they would call me in 2 weeks to arrange that final meeting where they would offer me a position. I have been waiting for 16 days now. To make things better, this isn't the only time they ""put me on hold"". I had been also waiting for the technical interview for a month. Reasons for such a long hiring process were the illness of the guy who was supposed to interview me and restructuring the hiring department. Also, my friend told me that the fact I sent an open request may also be the reason for the stall as they might have been creating a specific position for me or stuff like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for a position at a big company 25 days ago and they've already offered me an internship job. The whole hiring process went great. I am happy with how the interviews went and pleased with a quick offer. The position, as in the work I would do in the company, isn't as tempting as the one from the smaller company, but it is still close to my interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I accept (via email) the big company's offer and if I like the upcoming offer better, I would need to decline the accepted offer to work with the smaller company. This would be a big moral dilemma for me. But at the same time, I don't want to let go of an offer before hearing the other company as well. Also, what can I expect from a company that has been stalling me for 3 months? Would it be a good idea to contact the smaller company to ""hurry"" them so I could potentially have 2 open offers at the same time to avoid any unethical decisions?"

2316,I finally quit!,jobs,"Even since I started my first job out of college, I kinda noticed something was wrong. I was thrown into the deep end, and my best friend who also worked at the company with the same job but different boss noticed I had way to do than her. Soon I was crying in my office due to stress and a combination of my perfectionism. Then when I realized I was really hurting my mental health, I created some boundaries and then my boss noticed I was not able to finish as much as I was. Which yeah‚Ä¶. I was doing the job of 2 or 3 people. I can‚Äôt do it all. He began to micromanage and frequently tell me that this may not be the job for me and that I need to make progress or real issues will arise. And then at my 3 month mark, when he previously said I could WFH, that was no longer allowed when it came time because he wanted me to be in office everyday even though 96% of the company works from home. He was a terrible boss and come to find out the person before me who quit and felt all the same feelings I have been having was a relief. I really tried my best with this job. And yesterday was the perfect end as my boss was basically begging for me to quit. However one thing I learned is that sometimes there are people with unreasonable expectations and you‚Äôll never be good enough for them. And that is what this job taught me. Rant over."
2317,Got paid less than minimum wage? WWYD?,jobs,"Long story short, i started a new job at a nail salon.

There was no contract, written agreement or paperwork in any shorts. I know i would only get paid by commission ( 60/40. I keep 60% of what i make and full tips, owner keeps 40%).

Fast forward 6 weeks after, got paid 3 times. They are all between $380-$400 for 44hrs of work ( 2weeks period). Im from ON, Canada. 

The minimum wage is $15. And base on Employment Standard Acts, i need to get paid at least minimum wage.
Minimum wage: $15 x 44 = $660
Commission paid: $400
==&gt; i would still get paid the difference of $260.

But the owner only pays me $400. 

Now in the salon, there is no punch in/punch out machine so it's hard to keep track with how long i've worked.  She does not give me my pay stub, always pays me more than what i earn ( writes down $600 in check ) and demand me to send her back the difference...

I know what she's doing is illegal. What can I do to protect my rights? I have not cash the last 2 checks... I worry without written agreement or probable time sheets no one would believe me... 

Thanks for your help."
2318,"I'm now jobless, no car, with nothing around where I live hiring. What should I even do?",jobs,"So I recently quit my job because my friend promised that I for sure had a job I've where she works. Basically I got denied. Not really mad at them, I'm mad at myself for being an idiot. 

So now I have no clue what to do. I have no car, nor do I even know how to drive, an nowhere in town is hiring. At all. The closest job I can seem to find is a 2 hour walk in the middle of a very cold winter. 

I have no clue what to do. I don't really have to worry about rent right now since said friend is covering my portion until I can find something since she feels bad. Told her not to, but she insists. So I really need to find something as soon as possible. But I don't know what to do. 

Also. I put unemployment since I'm unemployed,and I have no idea what better flair to use. I am not trying to go on unemployment."

2335,Thinking of leaving my job after just one month,jobs,"About a month ago I started what I thought would be my dream job. I really like the work that I‚Äôm doing, but the problem is that the work environment isn‚Äôt what I wanted. I don‚Äôt think that I was properly trained for my job so I‚Äôm left still confused about some pretty basic tasks. It is a social services job and they wanted me to take on casework after just one week of onboarding and training. I pushed for 2 more days of training because I didn‚Äôt feel ready to go off on my own. 

I‚Äôm afraid to ask questions or speak out about my accomplishments. I shared in a meeting something I was proud about and my supervisor ended up going through my work and nitpicking. I understand id I did something wrong, but again I don‚Äôt think I was properly trained. Whenever I ask my manager simple questions, she turns it into an existential crisis and the big picture rather than just answering my question. I‚Äôve been told that I should ask less questions and just trust my gut. It doesn‚Äôt help that my manager constantly contradicts what our supervisor says. 

Also, and this is a big one for me, I don‚Äôt feel like the organization is interested in our growth as employees both in and out of the company and I surely don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre looking out for us. My supervisor never told me how to sign up for health insurance or even view my paystubs online. I had to ask my coworkers. 

I really miss my old company. I loved the company but didn‚Äôt like the job. Now I‚Äôm at an organization I find myself disliking doing a job that I would love if properly trained. 

I left on good terms and I loved my previous supervisor. I want to reach out to my old supervisor and get her thoughts on potentially coming back to my old company in a new role. I saw a job posting up and it contains the front facing type functions that I felt missing in my previous position. I just really conflicted because it‚Äôs only been one month."

He constantly gives me projects that never go anywhere. I will literally compete it and send it to him, and he will send it off to share and literally no one even reads it and when he follows up it‚Äôs like crickets because he‚Äôs creating work no one cares about or asked for.

My issue with him is that he‚Äôs constantly giving me a million projects that are all like this and asking me to complete it urgently, like he will literally IM me and call me to ask about it and try to rush me. And when I send it to him flying by the seat of my pants, literally no one even cares or responds lol so it‚Äôs like what was the point of making me stressed as hell? And he always wants to move up project meetings even though no one is asking for it or wants it moved up, making it super stressful for his team. 

And he always makes us join long meetings that are an hour or sometimes two that are completely useless late into the evening. He has trouble making decisions so literally he will make the entire team sit in the meeting to discuss a project and even after the discussion he‚Äòll have no idea and force two more follow up meetings. He usually pulls in more and more people because he ends up getting more confused unable to make a decision and talking in circles.

He also forces us to watch live as he creates a million spreadsheets because he needs someone to validate that his work makes sense and he just goes on and on and on until my life flashes before my eyes.

What annoys me the most is he‚Äôs always voluntary picking up work from other groups that have nothing to do with us and piling on the work to his own team when we‚Äôre not the experts and it doesn‚Äôt even belong to us. Of course the other teams are more than happy that he‚Äôs willing to take it on since it‚Äôs less work for them.

He‚Äôs always bragging about how people are always IMing him and how busy he is even though he‚Äôs mostly just doing busywork for other teams or creating work for himself that no one else cares about. And the team is a disaster too. Pretty much all the capable ones left so now the only ones left are the ones who don‚Äôt care to do well, can‚Äôt do well or have trouble leaving, which leaves even more work for me.

2340,Would it be wise to start off at 30hrs then up to 40hrs once I get in the groove?,jobs,"I'm starting at a company that recognizes 30hrs as full-time employment, as an incoming student (again), this is looking more and more attractive to me so that I can focus more time on my degree as well while I'm 'working'. It's officially recognized as a salaried position so whether I'm working 30 or 40hrs I get paid pretty much the same - I just have to clear at least 30hrs to be considered full time. My degree is a remote degree and it's something I can complete on my own time - so I don't have to be in class or in person at any point (except probably for final exams and whatnot).  

 I also haven't had a job in about 7-8 months, so I'm not used to working full time in any capacity and especially I'm not used to working and studying together. Basically, I don't want to burn out. 

Any advice how to approach this?  I am looking over the offer letter and there is nothing binding me immediately to a 40hr work week."

When I try to find salary data it can range anywhere from 65k-100k for my general job title (think data analyst).

2354,Employment advice,jobs,"I feel a bit dumb asking this but is there any advice in how to get a response from an employer for a job?

I left my last job in June 2021 so from that I decided to have a month break from working as it was the first time I've ever had any substantial time off and I wanted to enjoy it for a bit, then started searching for a job again. I've now been unemployed for 6 months.

I've applied for so many jobs, all in different areas and sectors and very very rarely get any contact back. I've gone to agencies but they never seem to have any work available. I managed to get a job at amazon but was fired after 2 weeks because I was on sick.

I genuinely don't know what to do next. I need to pay my car insurance very soon which I won't be able to afford which will then limit my job search even more.

I don't mean for this to come across as me complain how bad my life is or anything, just feel like these are all things that can relate to my job related problems.

2355,Interview Salon Receptionist.,jobs,"So I applied for a salon receptionist job and I have an interview tomorrow. Has anyone interviewed for a similar job before? How was it and what kind of questions do they ask? I have zero experience working at a salon, zero hair experience which is weird because they usually require you to have some sort of experience cutting hair or something but they still want to interview me. Also the online job description said $40,000 - $60,000 a year for salary which is hard for me to believe it‚Äôs that much when most positions like that around where I live only pay around $13 an hour at the most. Anyways any advice?"

2357,A choice between 2 jobs...,jobs,"Looking for opinions here...I have the choice between a sales job related to the housing market (lending side) or as a maintenance engineer at a major casino.  I'm great at sales, talking, building rapport, closing deals and I'm great with my hands, fixing things and manual labor.  I love both to be honest.

Both jobs are through people I know.  Sales job is 20 an hour plus commission.  Maintenance job starts at 24, bumps up after 90 days and maxes out at just under 31 an hour after a year.  Sales job supposedly has the commission potential to make way more that 31 an hour.  Both jobs have insurance, opportunity to move upward,  ect.  The sales job has a 401k plan, the maintenance job is union although they are working without a contract so no pay raises are scheduled after I max out.  Sales is a remote job working from home or wherever and maintenance is graveyard 11pm to 7am.  I'm not sure how long I would have to work graves before I can switch to swing or days.  Both jobs are for solid companies although the sales company is still growing and the housing market could collapse.  The casino isn't going anywhere.

That's honestly what's killing me.  I'm not in my 20s and I've operated sun up to sun down for at least 15 years.  Working from home also has it's drawbacks as I don't have kids or a pet that would benefit a work from home type of environment.  

Sales is fun when it's good and turns toxic when sales are down.  The housing market could give out and I'm stuck looking for something new.  I could be stuck on graveyard for years which I would hate.  Both are about the same amount of money (commissions potentially more) and I'm not 100% sure on either.  

I'm leaning towards the sales job even though I wanted to move on from sales.  The maintenance job is a new highlight on my resume as all the manual labor experience I had was over 15 years ago.  I'm just not sold on either and not sure which way to go.  

Am I missing anything or does anyone have any insight or opinions one way or the other?"
2358,Salary hour expectations,jobs,"I am a salary employee, around $35,000 a year.

I regularly work close to 50 hours weekly, and to be honest I don‚Äôt see the value in working that hard for that little. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to have any time for anything outside of work because of the expectations placed on me. When I accepted the job I was agreeing to a 40 hour work week, occasionally more. Now, I am expected to give up my weekend to work 10 hours each day to do a project that wouldn‚Äôt have even been a thing if it wasn‚Äôt for the incompetence of leadership. 

Is this normal? Is there any provision for salaried employees to receive overtime pay? Im starting to feel I‚Äôd be happier working somewhere with set hours"

2361,Going over your managers head,jobs,I have reached a breaking point with how I‚Äôve been managed since I took a new role at my company. I was assigned to a branch over a hour away and had a wonderful experience the 4 months I was there. I was getting experience towards the career path I want to take and felt like I was really progressing with the company. During this time I received little to no feedback from my manager. After I was assigned to different locations I brought up to my manager that I wanted to receive official training for some of the work I had already be doing . I was told that I needed to bloom where I was planted and was accused of not doing my job (which was not true). I was also told that the 4 months I had been assigned to a particular branch shouldn‚Äôt be considered for my job and I need to put that time ‚Äúon a shelf ‚Äú. After thinking about I finally pulled the trigger and told my regional manager was had been going on and wanted to be placed somewhere else with the company. She apologized for what I had experienced and wanted to get into more detail in due time. She also told me that the bank views my last few months as good experience and will count towards future roles. Hopefully next week I will have good news about a position I‚Äôm interested in. At this point I‚Äôm willing to go back to my old position. I‚Äôm just tired of feeling like my work is not appreciated and my image with the company is eroded by someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to manage people and is on a power trip.

2363,Feeling very discouraged‚Ä¶,jobs,"Hello everyone, I posted about a week ago how I became unemployed. Since then, I have been applying everywhere I could get my hands on. So far, I have applied over 50 jobs and it seems like I either A. Settle for the same wage I was making at my last job or B. Keep looking and potentially not be able to make enough for my personal bills/rent. I‚Äôm just very disappointed, there was this job that seemed super promising. 

The recruiter was so friendly and helpful and told me that her clients were very much interested in setting up an interview, I was so stocked. It was gonna be a $7+ raise PLUS remote job which is what I wanted. Well for some reason, they‚Äôre taking their sweet ass time on calling me back. According to the recruiter, they‚Äôre currently working on some big project which is why they‚Äôve been busy. Makes me feel like it‚Äôs BS and they‚Äôre probably waiting for a better candidate than me to interview and accept onto their company. I‚Äôm quite honestly extremely frustrated because I have over 6 years of experience as an admin/legal assistant and if just seems like it‚Äôs not enough‚Ä¶ I have interviewed for another job earlier today and I got the job. 

But it will be the same low paying wage AND I have to commute again while also having a TON OF WORK to do. I don‚Äôt mind working, if anything, I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm gonna be busy. But I just really hate that I‚Äôm gonna be back in a job that I will very much despise again because of how low I‚Äôm gonna be making again‚Ä¶ it seems to me that law firms are so damn stingy and never want to raise their wages. 

Makes me sick because the owners are rich people that can actually afford it‚Ä¶ sigh, obviously I‚Äôm very grateful for the opportunity but I‚Äôm just sick and tired of being low balled and basically have to settle because I have bills to pay‚Ä¶ just been a really hard week overall. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, I really appreciate you reading this far. Any positive thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

2367,Negotiating salary,jobs,"I currently received 2 offers from A &amp; B

They are both in the same industry, but A is the more desired position for me. However, it pays 50k where B is 70k. In the HR round for interview A, they said 50k was the budget and didn't have much wiggle room but plenty of room for growth in the future. (B said the same thing about plenty of room for growth)

Currently, I'm working at a similar job but in a slight different industry(but still related to each other) with a salary of 60k. When I began the job search, I was willing to lower my salary due to the industry change. And A was one of the first interviews I did, so I thought OK, I'll work with 50k for now.  

However, once I got more interviews I realized I could aim for more and there were a lot of other companies that were offering more. I also got a 3k raise from my current company.

A is the company I really want to go and the position is the one that I want. B is okay, but the company itself wasn't my top choices. But I'm torn between these two with the significant salary difference.

In this case, is it worth asking A for a 20k raise and is there any chance this would be accepted? If so, how would I word this out when I ask in the e-mail? 

\*A &amp; B has similar benefits, A has a few more PTO days."
2368,Upcoming interview #4 &amp; #5. Looking for strategies / advice.,jobs,"I am actively interviewing for 2 jobs (maybe 3). And the ones that I am most excited about for both the salary and the company has called me back for interviews #4 and #5.

I've interviewed with:

1. The CTO and Co-Founder: went great!
2. The CEO and Founder: went better than great!
3. The CFO/COO: went well, but not great.

I was a bit down after #3 on Tuesday but today they called me back for InterView #4 and #5 with:

* The Head of Project Management (reports to the COO)
* The person whose functions I will be ""replacing"": a part-time consultant, family friend of the CEO who is so very happy to leave. The company has grown beyond her time available, so there's no animosity in the transition.

I will be reporting to the CEO, so these last 2 interviews should be just simple checkmarks, but honestly, I am not used to interviewing with non-executive level employees.  

I have the perfect credentials for the job (education and experience) and I am perfect for the position (startup that has just raised **a lot** of capital, coming out from R&amp;D and launching product lines (large ticket items sold to Fortune 500, with a few deals already signed and a huge pipeline in the word).

**What are the strategies to follow?** Off the top of my head:

* dress business casual, not over the top, not too casual.
* establish rapport
* smile
* make eye contact, but not excessively
* active listening
* addressing the questions thoroughly


**What type of questions should I ask?**

If that matters, they are 2 women, one will be there IRL, the other will join in videoconferencing.  Interview #1, #2, and #3 were men, and I am a guy too."

2377,Is job market misrepresented during COVID? Too good to be true?,jobs,"I just want to ask since I often see posts as if the job market has never been healthier. Even read the stat ""1 applicant per every 5 jobs posted.""

Does anyone else feel that this is inaccurate, and the job market depends a lot on the industry, location and salary expectations?

I guess it just seems frustrating to feel like an obvious caveat is being overlooked in job reports, on LinkedIn and in the media.

For example it seems like most openings are either in low paid service jobs like restaurants/retail/hospitality, or in hyper skilled jobs like development/coding/data science.

I think the other frustration is, if the market is that hot, how in the heck could anyone with experience and a degree, but no super niche skills, be not getting any interviews from 60+ apps? Do these reports mainly apply to entry level service industry gigs?

I'm open to hearing any ideas on the market... but for a while now I've felt like giving up on searching and trying to start my own business instead."

I just want a third party perspective on this.
One day myself and a few others were told to stack boxes as part of a task at the end of the day. The company was short staffed at the time so the people that were told had to stack these boxes although it wasn't part of our job description. Anyways, I was the first or maybe second person to get started and my shift had started an hour and a half earlier than most other people that day too. So after some time, my shift is over and I leave for the day. As I am leaving the manager stops me and essentially says that other people were still working and that I should work with them to be a part of the team. I had the choice and I ended up staying about thirty minutes after my shift. I later found out that my co-worker(s) told on me to the manager and this was counted as a complaint. Was I being a jerk for trying to leave on time or was this just petty on their part?"

2383,Temporary to permanent - Concerns on 90 day review,jobs,"So I landed this temporary to permanent position as a systems administrator at this company. When I cap my 90 days, they'll decide whether to make me permanent or not. 

The position was targeted towards a particular project but later on I got removed from it because the client apparently didn't see me as ""too senior for the role"". Which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. 

Anyways, I'm still with the company just doing other work. Now, here are my questions and concerns: 

1. If they ever decide to keep me, my salary and position should stay as it is right? I'm asking this because I came in initially as a sys admin for a project which I got removed off later on. 

2. What if they offer me to stay but I have to take another position with a lower salary. Can they legally do that? 

The offer letter words it as "" in this position, if an offer is made, your salary will be converted what it is right now .."" So that's what got me thinking about this.

2388,Took job with pay cut with idea that I could get a raise.,jobs,"I went from working on one contract to working for the same parent company on a different contract. The hiring contact informed me that this would be a slight pay cut, but said if I did a good job they were authorized to give me a raise without the stipulation that I would need to have worked there for any certain amount of time.

In my previous role I was a mobile device manager for a US Army service desk. In my current role, I'm a software testing associate for a US government organization. The current median for software testing associates in my state is over 58K/year.

Previous job = 49K/year
Current job = 45K/year
Current median for state = 58K/year

I want to ask for a raise but I'm not sure how to do it. In a perfect world I could ask for 58K/year, buti don't know if that's acceptable. How would you suggest I go about asking?

Note: I have worked in this particular role for almost a year now but have been with the parent company for more than 10 years.

I'm having trouble finding a job after two years of unemployment (covid). Most of my experience (around 2-3 years) prior to that is customer service. Most of it was short term due to being in school at the time and not being able to work and go to school full time at the same time (I was also arguably not ready to start university). I have an unfinished bachelors degree, which I am trying to finish by self funding from my next job.

The majority of jobs Ive applied to are remote (100% and temp wfh)

I'm honestly thinking of trying to pick up Excel and PowerBI, and brushing off my Pythn/SQL (CS major) to start applying to data/business analyst positions. Would that work?

I thought I'd be coming back to work this week but didn't hear anything. When I reached out to say I'm excited to go back to work whenever they need me, they said there's nothing next week but maybe the one after that and they'll be in touch. I also was previously told that I get holiday pay so was depending on some money from that, and when I asked again it turns out my role does not get any. So basically I'm not getting paid for a month or so. I knew it was a part time job but this is already concerning and I'm worried it will continue. Although other PAs I met said they work every week, just sometimes not many days. So it might be that it's slow at the beginning of the year or they're taking some time with the covid surge.

I have a friend who works at an animation studio that's looking for PAs. I know from him that it's a good place to work and is full time, 50hr/week. So that's dependable pay. I'm not as excited about that job but still interested and I do need money.

Should I send my resume to the animation job and possibly have an interview with them to consider it, or just give this new job some time to see if it's something that can become more financially supportive?

So I took initiative to solve an issue on my own that‚Äôs under my job description and messed up. I own that and didn‚Äôt hide it, it wasn‚Äôt earth shattering and was easily fixable. However she sat me down and essentially said she didn‚Äôt think the job was for me and how she needs to see improvement or it won‚Äôt work out etc. I guess what bothers me the most revolves around the fact I‚Äôve literally been here a month and am essentially cut loose at this point with no further training. Okay my job is handling many aspects at once as she says all the time, that also means I should have extensive exposure to all those moving parts before I‚Äôm cut loose. This isn‚Äôt just the trade I‚Äôm in but the facility which has its own web of instructions etc. 

First off I feel like I really did nothing close to warranting that conversation, secondly I just feel like this isn‚Äôt a conversation to have at 30 days in. I‚Äôm new, new people slip up. That‚Äôs why probation periods are often 6 months. I‚Äôve never had such a hands off training. Expressing this I know would bring more ire. The truth is I am getting better and the position is self sufficient enough my boss doesn‚Äôt bother me being witchy as I can just ignore her bad attitude, I‚Äôm just worried she fire me before that.How should I approach the situation? She‚Äôs been very nice the day after and was telling others how she had a very bad day yesterday, I just am even wondering if I should take what she said to heart as a threat to me job or just her venting. She gets easily frustrated and upset at people I think my issue is I‚Äôm her only direct report. I just feel like if my job was truly on the line she would have had to make me sign one of those improvement plan sheets (which I‚Äôve seen others have to do in different departments so I know the company uses them) rather than just say ‚Äòthis isn‚Äôt for you‚Äô snottily."

2416,Getting a new job is so stressful. I think people lose sight of that,jobs,"I am unemployed but not by choice.  I have been fortunate to have a lot of interviews, and found a good job but the comp needed slight massaging.  I have never been in an industry where you could negotiate comp until now.  Don't pass judgement or assumptions.

Their application online makes you put in a range, but honestly... for this role, there is no way to really know what the comp should be until the process is done.

I have been trying to ""negotiate"" but am finding it odd.  The day the offer was extended HR told me everything was negotiable.  I needed to find about $10k in extra comp and all of my research showed that the offer was at the lowest end of the range, colleagues have told me as well.  I approached HR asking if they would consider negotiating within a higher range, and gave the same findings.  Got called back &amp; was told my comp is the highest at their budget amount.  

Not sure what to do, since I really hadn't given a counter at all ... I put in my counter which was higher than the budget amount that HR stated they were at.  I used several reasons about why I need the comp at $X and several concessions I would be willing to take.  My only response from HR was thanks, they will take it to the team, and then ...""have a nice weekend, we will talk on monday"" ...

I logged into the ATS system after that &amp; found that my offer letter is gone &amp; my status is now back to ""interviewing"".  THE MIND IS A POWERFUL THING!!!  You really have to keep a strong mentality to not drive yourself crazy during these times.  I suppose it's good that I haven't been moved to rejected ... but it's just weird that someone updated my status enough to remove the offer letter but not just give a call.

2418,I never thought someone would use my *approved* reasonable accommodations as retaliation at a higher ed institution. Would you do anything differently?,jobs,"Today is the last day of my job and I need to get off my chest my story.

I would prefer to keep the name anonymous for now because the overall place I work I absolutely respect, it's the department and team I was on and I left for more reasons than one. What I will say is it's a higher ed place. 

So let's get to the meat and potatoes of this accommodation situation. I am diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, there are other diagnoses I have but did not need accommodation assistance. Here is what I asked for 

\-A priority list

\-Clear Expectations

\-Advocacy

\-Clear distinction of what's essential

So basically none of them met but the one where I say retaliation came from was from the ""Priority List."" Instead of getting this, I got subject to 8:30am meetings every single day. The person working with me on my accommodations already did not like this and said they need to taper overtime. With these meetings I was supposed to lead them, list out the tasks I needed to do and  get input on how to best prioritize my day. What I got instead was me leading this meeting, it ""ending"" and then I would get reviewed on the work I did and didn't get done, and even if all my work wasn't done, indication about how I didn't do enough work. The daily meetings were only supposed to last for two weeks but they convinced HR to extend them their reasoning being ""they need more info about what my workload is like"" while the verbal explanation I received was it was because of ""time management"" concerns. None of this was consulted by employee relations, and this was never an issue when I started my job and these ""coachings"" were only done coinciding with my accommodation meetings. (Note while my direct supervisor was there, HER boss was the one doing all of this, while complicit she was not the aggressor)These wore me down and I was about to leave quietly until the job I'm about to start called my direct supervisor. Her supervisor then confronted me and said ""I am concerned and wondering if this is the reason you haven't been putting in your 100%.""

 With this being said, I decided to launch a formal investigation and complaint. The following weeks I was treated with so much disrespect I wrote a letter with all my evidence to employee relations, HR, and some of the institution higher-ups which included a 10 page letter, and over 100 pages of evidence.....I feel brave but also terrified, Considering how much HR has been saying they hate what they're doing I'm curious if they'll actually take action. Needless to say I'M FREE"
2419,Should I be concerned about too much downtime at work?,jobs,"I am a new employee working at a company that has thousands of employees and I been having a lot of downtime sitting at my cube waiting for work since I started this job. I check in with my colleagues almost everyday asking if I can help out on projects and there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt much tasks they can give me. 

It‚Äôs probably normal for new employees because I‚Äôve experienced it too a few years ago on my first job after college for about 2-3 months. But with this new job I have now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having a lot of downtime for 6-8 months and it‚Äôs becoming very concerning to me. I feel like I might get in trouble or get laid off when the company is paying me to do nothing most of the time. 

Often times I would have to act like I‚Äôm busy by staring at the computer or read papers but the company requires me to track my timesheet and make my 8 hours billable on what I‚Äôm doing at work. That stresses me the fuck out when I really don‚Äôt have anything to work on and keep charging training as my downtime on the timesheet.

I wonder if I‚Äôm not the only one dealing with this similar situation? What are your advices to avoid downtime, staying productive and getting better involvement at work? Anything helps!"

2431,My 9mo journey from unemployment to employed,jobs,"Happy New Year, everyone! I just wanted to take some time to share my story of going through some tough times while unemployed during the pandemic and fortunately coming out of it on top with a great job offer and FINALLY getting back on my feet.

Background: I (24M) graduated college in 2019 and shortly moved to a new state to pursue a career in Aerospace &amp; Defense. In Q2 2021, due to business restructuring and COVID, my department laid off 20% of its employees and I unfortunately was included in that. I took a severance package and decided to take some time off before jumping into a new role. Why? Several reasons: I had just moved to a new state with 0 friends or family, the job itself was inexplicably stressful, and WFH for all of 2020 and 2021 (up until when i got laid off) really ruined my mental health to the point where I was borderline depressed. So, I felt like I needed some time off to live stress free. I didn't really have a plan, but I had enough savings to make ends meet.

The first 3mo were great! I was able to just chill out and decompress after 2yrs of tough work and no social life. It really was nice, but damn does time fly by! Pretty quickly, 3mo turned into 6mo and I was starting to become really nervous/scared. I didn't have a job, felt like a bum, and my self confidence/self worth completely tanked as a result. I began to apply to jobs in early September and had several interviews lined up, but nothing ever came from them. In interviews, it became obvious that I was unattractive as a candidate given my 6mo unemployment stint. Oct/Nov rolls around and I begin to feel deeply depressed again. Was this karma for not taking the job hunt seriously in the beginning? What happened to this ""hiring frenzy"" job market post-COVID that the media spoke of? I never planned to go into the new year unemployed, but it was beginning to look very possible that it would be my reality.

The last interview I had was with another Aerospace company and during the phone interview I thought I completely shit the bed. I began to convince myself that I probably wasn't going to get the job and that I needed to be mentally prepared for it when it happened. That interview took place around the Christmas timeframe and it was a very depressing week of constantly checking my emails to see if there was any good news. Several days later, out of nowhere, I received an email from the company I interviewed with saying that they planned on extending a fulltime offer to me! It completely took me by surprise as I definitely felt like I performed horribly in the interview. Regardless, after 9 months of unemployment, I finally had a job offer with an amazing company that offered a great salary, too! My search is over and I can finally get back on my feet. It's been the best week ever I swear.  So, the point of this post is to encourage anyone else in this situation who is currently struggling with unemployment that there is light at the end of the tunnel! It happened to me and im sure so many others this year. If it can work out for us, it can work out for you as well. Keep pushin on my friends &lt;3"

2437,I need to get a job and I am scared [This is not a COVID-related post],jobs,"I have over 25 years work experience and have had the privilege of not having to work the last 3 years as my husband earned enough for both of us. But now my husband will have some well deserved time off, to explore the realm of self-employment, and I need to become the bread winner.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for being scared is that I have never had a job that didn't affect my health (physical, mental or both) in a negative way. I have serveral different health conditions and am afraid that if I disclose these to my employer, before the probation period is over, I will not be kept on, but if I don't, my health will suffer for a long time after the probation period is over affecting my work performace in a negative way. Both scenarios scares me.

I am also scared that I will not be able to hide all of them for the 6 months a probation period lasts if I go with that course of action.

As I have previously been dismissed due to one of my conditions despite having had very, very good performance reviews before I was forced to disclose my condition over an ad-hoc assignemt. So my fear has foundation in experience.

&amp;#x200B;

That I am well aware that I might not be as productive as an employer at full health doesn't hep either.  It tends to make me work long hours and extra hard in order to compensate for my self experienced ""inadequacies"". At the same time I  always finish things before deadline, so this behaviour is not neccessary. It is simply my fear of not being good enough due to my health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also considered disclosing my health issues after I have signed my contract, but if I get dismissed before the probation period is over, I will ask myself for the rest of the life the real reason for dismissal was my health issues and not whatever reason they gave. The pndering offer such a situation will not improve my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

You could argue: Why would you like to work for an employer who doesn't accept you for who you are and isn't humane enough to value you for the good job you do and make the adjustments needed?  Well, I would love to find an employer who does but where would I find such an employer? So far I haven't succeeded.

(And I don't need very expensive investments. Just a few adjustments to my office work-station, 6 hour workdays and the possibility to work from home one day a week or a 4 day workweek.)

&amp;#x200B;

The times when I have talked to a therapist about my fear of geting a new job, their advice hasn't been helpfull. So I don't consider that a helpful resouce either.

&amp;#x200B;

Any HR persons, or persons who struggle with health issues, that can give advice on what to do? (I live in Switzerland in case it matters.)

2449,Should I stay or should I go,jobs,"I‚Äôve been offered a job offer at a new law firm (AB) and after much deliberation by myself and with HR of my current firm (CD), I still don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I am happy with my overall position at CD and see the job at AB as a ‚Äústep up‚Äù in terms of the quality of work and clientele. If AB‚Äôs benefits package had not been such an increase (even say 10%), I would not have considered it. 

1. Progress

The partners in my department at CD are all within the 58-63yr age bracket and are all considering retiring in the near-medium future. Whilst no time scales have been discussed, there is clear potential for me to become an equity partner and head of department, if I wanted - HR have stated that this is very much a realistic goal which is something they ‚Äúreally‚Äù want me to consider in relation to my resignation. 

Whilst it is more grey and, in my opinion, AB has a good potential growth to become an EP - similar to that at CD. Chance of head of department would be a longer process at AB as the current head of department is considerably younger than those at CD. 

I hadn‚Äôt really considered my aspirations of head of department before it was discussed with HR but realistically, it would be a good goal for me to aim for - but in now way the ‚Äúbe all and end all‚Äù.  

CD has offered me a great level of responsibility since becoming qualified and the responsibility continues to grow. I understand that I will have to build up trust at AB before I get the level of responsibility I have at CD - but it is AB‚Äôs ambition for me to have a similar level of responsibility. 

2. Aspirations

Ultimately, main ambition is to become an equity partner. I‚Äôm unsure on how long this should take and don‚Äôt want to get ahead of myself considering I‚Äôm only 2yrs PQE+. 

I‚Äôve also noted that solicitors and partners at AB have been nominated as ‚Äúrecommended lawyers‚Äù and ‚Äúnext up and coming lawyers‚Äù on the Legal 500. Whilst HR at CD acknowledge that these are great personal accolades to achieve they have stated that Legal 500 is very much a marketing tool and something which CD, due to the lack of a marketing team (for other reasons which I won‚Äôt go into), can‚Äôt really try to seek at the moment. 

3. Quality of work/clientele

Worked for CD for 4.5yrs (2.5yrs qualified). Variety of work can be varied however the basis of my work is fairly standard (1/2 deals ticking along in the background, general company secretarial work, standard share re-structuring). 

AB would very much similar work (+ new experience in other matters) but with more prestigious clientele and matters would be more complex. AB is a tier 1 law firm whilst CD is a tier 2 firm. 

4. Salary

Job at AB is a 22% pay increase to my current salary. 

CD have, whilst no figure put forward yet, confirmed they will trump the pay increase. CD want me to consider the other factors at play before giving me the figure."

I work as a receptionist at a dental office. yesterday I was yelled, cursed, and freaked out on by the doctor I work with. In a few days I was supposed to work with her for two straight weeks as we are short staffed and the dental assistant is leaving for two weeks on vacation. I am certified but in the past working with dental offices it has not been so good. They‚Äôve always mistreated and yelled at me whenever I did something wrong. I now despise assisting and now I have to do it with someone who just freaked out on me over something super small. I understand we are all stressed but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you can just yell at me. I had texted them and let them know that I did not respect the yelling that was done and that I wanted to quit. They have been trying to reach me by calling me and texting me saying it was a misunderstanding and we are a ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù Am I in the wrong for leaving them with no front desk or assistant even though she was the one who disrespected me?

 or some variation of this. I thought at first it was spam yet I keep getting them from multiple positions I've applied to from multiple companies with different numbers.

2460,Feel Like I'm Failing At My Job &amp; I'm Miserable,jobs,"I started a job a little over 7 months ago, after leaving an unhealthy work situation. This job was more in line with my career aspirations and a welcome change of pace. Since I've been here, things have gone south very very quickly.

The first few months were good, but about 3 months in my boss really started piling on. When I joined, I was told I would be using agencies to get things done (I work in creative advertising), with the eventual goal of building an in-house team of freelancers &amp; FT workers to transition to. At this point (3 months in), my boss informed me that I would in fact not have any access to agencies, and that he didn't feel hiring designers to create things was necessary. Instead he wanted ME (someone who is not a designer) to create all of our advertising. In addition, he wanted to expand our efforts, meaning I would need to produce 20+ ads a week, on top of the rest of my responsibilities.

Up until now, I've always considered myself really good at what I do. Past colleagues and bosses (and some at this company) have also expressed to me that I have a talent for what I do, which is brand strategy/management. But now, I'm just failing all the time. My boss is never pleased with my work, and always has something critical to say about it and me. At one point, when I expressed my workload was too heavy and would need to be prioritized, he insinuated that I would be able to get it all done if I was more effective as a worker.

I know I need to leave, and am in the process of job hunting, but I don't know how to survive this day to day, especially so soon on the heels of another bad job. I cry more often than not, and every day feels like a struggle to get up.

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? How do you manage?"

This would be great because I would get benefits and not have to work multiple jobs (the millennial dream!), but after being here 9 months I am worried about maintaining my work/life boundaries if I am salaried.

The department is full of people who willingly overwork themselves, wait until deadlines are right on top of them, and don‚Äôt know how to say no. For instance they all came back from the winter holiday talking about how they worked every day and didn‚Äôt get a break at all. Even I had to do some work over the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù but I got to clock it and get paid. 

Having my hourly pay where I can log time if they text me outside my usual hours or fall back on ‚Äúremember I‚Äôm only allowed 18 hrs a week‚Äù has been hugely helpful for maintaining my own healthy work/life balance. 

Without that excuse, how can I keep from being overworked or having unfair expectations in terms of when I am available? Is there anything I can negotiate for in my contract about ONLY working 40 hours? Or getting extra compensation if I do go over even though I would be exempt?

I do believe this is with best intentions for improvement (I know some will say it‚Äôs a safe guard for HR etc) and I know my hasn‚Äôt been perfect. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes, either through lack of understanding or motivation issues.

However, I will also add that although me and my boss get on on a personal level, we have communication issues and she can be quite toxic. She‚Äôs a hyper control freak, which really hampers my motivation and I‚Äôve had very little training from since I started. She accepts herself that she needs to improve with me too (for example, I was ignored for about 2 weeks when I really needed to clear something up with her and it was subsequently missed).

Regardless of all this, I do think my time is up. I haven‚Äôt really progressed whatsoever, even gone backwards in some sense. The anxiety that I‚Äôve felt in the past few months simply isn‚Äôt worth it and I‚Äôm ready to start again.

2485,Here's the most important lesson I've learned landing interviews with cold email:,jobs,"Maximize the perceived ROI your target gets for replying to you.  


You can do this by affecting two levers:  


**Lever 1: The perceived value you provide them**  


**Lever 2: The amount you cost them**  


Let's unpack lever 1: The perceived value you give them.  


You can provide someone with value by satisfying one of their incentives.  


Everyone has different incentives, but we all have some desire to make money or feel loved.  


If you write an email that shows you're a good candidate to a recruiter, you're satisfying their money incentive.  


Similarly, by giving someone a thoughtful compliment, you're satisfying their desire to feel love incentive.  


In both cases, by satisfying an incentive, you‚Äôre creating value in your target's life.  


Now onto lever 2: The amount you cost them.  


Money isn't the only resource you can cost someone. You can also cost them time and energy.  


So the shorter and clearer an email is, the less you're costing them in time and energy.  


A low-cost email is written with simple words, is concise, has a lot of spacing, and has a really clear call to action.  


If you need an example for this, you can check out this cold email I sent out before that landed me an interview.  


Lemme know if you have any questions :) will do my best to help."
2486,Debating between 2 job offers: 42k 2 year contract vs 52k contract to hire?,jobs,"I currently make 20 an hr or 42k, and this job is offering 25 an hour or 52k. However, the 52k job is contract to hire. My current job I already have health insurance through, and the other one, I would have to wait 60 days for health insurance. My current job is more logistics analyst where we do SLA tickets on devices in the store, wipe them, and call the stores to fix transport errors. The other job is a service desk analyst job where I would be taking 30-45 calls a day dealing with Citrix, Operating system, boot errors, drive mapping, etc. And they preferred the average call time to be under 13 minutes. 

He was saying supposedly they hire people after 3, 6, or 9 months, and all I have to do is basically show up and complete my tickets well. I don't know how truthful that is though. He was saying that the contract company wouldn't have made a deal with the company if it was a revolving door where there constantly turning people over, so that want someone to get hired on.

My current job is just a 2 year contract, that is not contract to hire with no promotion opportunties, and pays 10k less though. My current job seems more chill tho, so I'm wondering if 10k more is worth the stress of taking more calls.

The second job seems like it would have more promotion opportunities if hired on though because it's for an insurance brokerage. Whereas, my current job is for a big retail company that seems like they just hired us to do busy work tickets, and I'm not really learning anything. My current job as a whole is fairly chill though since I only have to take a few calls compared to 30-40 at the other one. 

I've heard a lot of people say not to take contract to hire roles because you're always worried about keeping your job. But, some people tell me it's a no brainer and to take it because it's 10k more, and the 2 year contract role will run out anyways. So, is it worth it try the contract to hire role or stay at my current job?"

2490,Is it fair to ask WHY I have to come to work in person instead of being allowed to work remotely?,jobs,"This is my first job and I work at a private middle school, in a separate admin building from students but I still cross paths with students a few times a day. My office was partially remote when I first started in 2020, but for over a year now I have been required to come in full time every day, along with about 6 other people in my office. I share an office with 4 other people. This week, 3 teachers and nearly half of our students stayed home because of COVID exposures or positive COVID tests. I was still asked to come in and none of the supervisors recommended we work remotely or even brought up the possibility.  


With this new variant, our supervisors are really dragging their feet on letting us go back to remote. They don't acknowledge it as an option unless I bring it up. I've asked about it multiple times, but they say it makes more sense to double mask and test ourselves and keep coming in. All of my friends' workplaces that were in-person in December have gone completely remote but my office has no plans of doing anything similar. There is only a small part of my job that requires me to be in person, and I could accomplish all of my weekly in-person tasks in just one work day. All of my other coworkers could very likely work from home too, but no one is bringing it up except for me. Of course I want to work from home because it's more comfortable and I hate commuting, but it also feels like a slap in the face that my work doesn't care enough about us to even consider letting us work from home. My question is if it's fair to ask what the benefit of working in person is vs. keeping us more COVID-safe by letting us be remote? Is there a better way to bring this up so I don't sound like I'm just lazy and want to work from home?"

I think I'm still contagious and don't want to expose patients.,jobs," I (22F) work as an aide at an inpatient rehab facility for mostly old people who've had strokes, cancer, TBIs, or other conditions that mean they need help with their care. I started having symptoms Friday and tested positive Monday. Obviously I didn't go to work this week but they're asking me to come in tomorrow and Sunday because it's been five days since symptom onset and apparently the CDC thinks you can't spread it anymore after that even though I tested positive again today.

None of this sits right with me. If any of my patients catch my sickness they could die. Or, I could give it to one patient who spreads it throughout the facility, or I could give it to staff who will either spread it or have to call in sick which makes us even more short-staffed. I am supposed to be filling in for the full-time aides this weekend and am the only PRN, so if I call off there will be no one to help the therapists etc. But it feels morally wrong for me to come in, so I was going to call in sick again and say I'm still not feeling well even though I feel fine.

2498,So my new workplace also required us to start working from office... And now I don't know what to do.,jobs,"Hi all,

so I am working in my new job a little more than 2 months. WFH is very important for me, I love it! We are building our house and I planned separate room just for home office. I love not needing to spend time on preparing and traveling to the office.

So before starting I asked what is their plan and situation with WHM. They said they don't have a plan, it is flexible, most are working from home.

And now our manager said: please start coming to the office more often. (The least 1time per week, better more often.)

And I don't care is it 3,2,1 time I DON'T WANT IT.

I love the job I am doing but I hate this new requirement. What's more the reasoning why they are doing that is stupid. They want to build ""culture"". 

This is an international company. We are all working in different teams, I have none collegues from my country in both teams I am working. Also, the origin country which owns the company let's their employees WFH 100%...

I am so angry and sad right now. The only reason they want this is because our manager and hr are very outgoing and require us to attend all office parties and now come to the office. Because this is what they like....

And it is really that much important to me that I am willing to look for a new job. Even though I love everything else about it... I think to talk with a manager but not sure how much would it help. She might just say, yes, you are not fitting anymore because we need people to work from office.

I am also thinking what my team would say. Because my manager is constantly praising me for my good work and now it seems they would get rid of me for a such stupid thing...

So heh I am lost what to do. :/"
2499,is it unprofessional to change my mind after getting a job offer?,jobs,"[For context, I'm 17] 

I recently applied to work at SeaWorld, went through the phone interview, and was offered a job in their merchandising department. At first I was fine with it because I assumed I'd be working in the shops since that's the job description. But towards literally the last minute of the interview, my interviewer kinda mumbled that I'd be in the locker room area. Which meant I'd just quite literally be handing out keys to people and assigning them lockers. I really don't want this sort of job since I'm more used to fast paced environments and i prefer them to be a bit more stressful rather than well handing out keys for hours. On top of that the pay is low (obviously it's a boring job) and they won't allow me to work weekdays since I'm still a student.

My first day isn't until the 22nd but I have orientation next Tuesday to get paperwork filled out and what not. I haven't officially filled anything out but i told my interviewer that I wanted to go forward with the job before I knew the key thing. Now I'm not sure what to do because I worry it's unprofessional to just email them and say ""nevermind, this job doesn't suit my interests anymore, I apologize for the inconvenience"" but at the same time I really do not like boring jobs. Sure I could stick to it for a couple months but I feel like I'd just be wasting my time for a couple bucks.

Would it be okay to email them? What should I do?"
