1,Any advice on my next career move?,careerguidance,"Hello,

I am having trouble figuring out what I should do next and what skills I should build on. I have 10 years of electronic repair experience and I want to work on more complex machinery. I'm hoping to bounce some ideas off of everyone.

Here is a list of my skills

1. Radio repair with the military ( RT1523, Blue force tracking/gps)
2. Satellite military work ( WIN-T )
3. Soldering
4. Troubleshooting
5. Any equipment in an ATM ( current job )
6. Computer troubleshooting ( IT/Hardware )

I am in the beginning interview process with Lockheed Martin and I think it's a nice step into what I'm looking for. I don't have a college education so I'm worried this will stop me from finding jobs like Lockheed.

Does anyone have any advice or insight?

Thank you."

3,Should I look for a new position if I feel burnt out?,careerguidance,"I enjoy what I do at my job, but it's a very fast paced environment. I feel like I've grown and learned a lot, but I'm also extremely drained by the end of everyday. Although I enjoyed my projects and gained many news skills, I don't think I can continue to sustain my current level of productivity (just to produce 'passable' work) without having multiple breakdowns every month. My manager has already helped me manage and prioritize what I need to get done, but I feel like I'm just slower than most and I personally put a lot of pressure on myself.

Plus, it's extremely tiring to stare at a computer screen and use my brain for 8+ hours a day. Is this enough reason to start looking for a new role? I've been here &lt;1 year so I don't want to seem like a job hopper also there's always learning curve whenever you go somewhere new. Any advice as to what I should do or consider going forward?"

5,Can anyone really apply to any field if they put the time in?,careerguidance,"Im in grade 10. I really want to start closing down on the fields i want to major in in the future. Ive been thinking of programming, computer science, engineering and chemistry. Mainly for programming and computer science, ive tried a bit here and there, learning ruby 2 years ago over the summer with a video and trying to do some basic projects. I was able to only finish pong. 
 But now im really starting to doubt if I can succeed in any of these fields. I know that for all of these fields an innate ability to problem solve is required. Idk if I have what it takes, or if time, persistence, and education can brute force past anything. So, is problem solving really required in programming and cs or can anyone just learn them, regardless of how dumb they may be, and just still be able to bypass most problems with little issues"
6,What career would you recommend ?,careerguidance,"16 year old looking for advice

Hey I’m 16 years old in secondary school in Ireland and I have an idea on what I want to do but not an exact position that interests me . I’m really into basketball and want to do something got to do with that . Id never have an opportunity to become a player but I’m not afraid of hard work if it’s means I can do a job that I love with a good salary . So I’m wondering if there’s any particular job that has a good salary got to do with the nba that is achievable through hard work ?"

8,Are there lots of companies where executives get paid a lot more than other employees in the organization? Or is it usually more fair than that?,careerguidance,"I worked at a company where there was about 500 employees. About 10 of the employees are executives. I calculated the average salary across every employee at the company and it was about $66,000. My salary was $54,000 but I was an Entry Level Support Analyst. So I would imagine I was definitely near the bottom in terms of pay. 

When covid happened  it seemed like no one really got laid off. Maybe 10-20 people max.

My question is, do you think it would be possible for the CEO to be making like $5,000,000 per year and all of the other executives make $1,000,000+ as well?

I would just think that's pretty messed up lol. But I mean people can just leave if they don't feel like they're getting paid well enough."
9,"Been getting into the 3D and Architectural Visualization world in Blender and Unreal Engine for a month now, but architecture/design was never my vocation and I am not sure where to aim at. In what other sector can I build a portfolio and get a job/freelance in a time frame of 6 months?",careerguidance,"I am a 23 yo graduated from film school over a year ago. I have been getting into Blender/UE4 for a month now and I am enjoining it very much. I love how I can create anything just with my imagination, a computer, and my will to put the work.  


I am forcing myself to learn 3D Architectural Visualization because it seems to be the most employable option. But the thing is, I have no vocation for Architecture or Interior Design, it is something that never occurred to me of doing. Although I love seeing the final render and I have successfully rendered some interiors, I don't feel the same attachment as I have for, for example, videogames, art, movies, or concepts (not saying architecture isn't art, but it definitely is more procedural and there are certain creative constrains, you sort of follow a roadmap when doing it.) Like, I was that one kid who would say the dream is to work at Blizzard or something.  


Blender Guru sometimes talks about how we have to take jobs that we don't particularly enjoy so we can pay the bills. That's why I felt maybe Archviz is the most ""close to reality"" job that I can get. I also have hispanic parents so to say that you are a 3D Architectural Designer sounds more ""real"" than to say that ""I work on videogames."" Maybe they are wrong and probably video games have more demand, but I am so unsure and don't know anyone in the industry neither! Since I am still with my parents, I set myself a timeline of 6 months to build a portfolio in a specific niche and either get a job or have consistent freelance work.   


Which areas would you recommend that are employable and skills that are currently being sought out in the 3D world? I want to commit and spend my time wisely doing something I can flow and enjoy. Thank you in advance!"

11,What are the best fields for introverts who want the option of not having to go to grad school? Details below,careerguidance,"I’m a current sophomore biology major and I’m starting to look into biotechnology and Bioprocessing science path instead, as I’m really burnt out and want to pursue an occupation that pays well, makes me happy, and doesn’t necessarily force me to go to grad school to get a good job (I’m interested in a master’s degree but idk if I’ll be able to/ willing to do it right after my bachelors?)

13,"I wanna work in selling cars, but my social skills are not very good, How can i improve?",careerguidance,"I could work as a mechanic or automotive painter but being a salesman would earn me most and overall is cleaner work. I never had great socials skills i can carry a conversation for a little bit but i quickly run out of what to say to keep people interested. 

I don't have social anxiety or stuff like it i just have bad social skills even conversations with family can quickly turn awkward because of me.

Any tips on how i can improve? I'm kind of stuck i don't seem to get any better but i'm motivated this job would start me out at 2000 a month. (first job) After some years would be earning about 3000-4000€ which is about 1000 to 1500 more than mechanic and 500-1000 more than painter.

Any help is very much appreciated, I wont be asnwering in the next few hours since i am going to bed.

Thank you for reading."

15,Go or stay?,careerguidance,"For months I have been over thinking over the idea of finishing my last two years at college or going to another campus. This campus I would move to is no better than the one I am at currently, just another branch campus of the college I go to (Penn State). The main reason I would want to stay in my hometown is because I already know all the faculty and it is cheaper obviously. The main reason I would move out is because I would get to know myself a lot more. Which decision should I make?"
16,"Employer offers to pay training, but I want to quit. How should I react?",careerguidance,"I have been thinking about switching careers for some time now. I have been working at the same company straight out of uni, so for a few years now. But for the most part I'm unhappy and also experienced a lot of drama there throughout the years (but who hasn't). I was always too afraid to make the switch. Until now...

My current employer has sensed my dissatisfaction. In the past my supervisor and I discussed multiple times how I can progress within the company, but in the end nothing came out of it, due to the company's limited budget. In mid 2021 I came up with a proposal how to contribute more to the work-department to make the switch to better position. My supervisor accepted and together with my coworkers we are slowly working on redistributing work tasks, so I can transition to a different position. In the end of all of this, (my potential new position) must be approved by the board of directors. Since I have worked for this company for a few years now, I have witnessed that these negotiations can take place in the short term, i. e. right before the work contract ends. And I've seen colleagues getting screwed over in this process.

So I'm skeptical and while staying at the company I'm working on my exit plan: I'm working with a coach to solve some job related insecurites. And I recently enrolled in a qualification program to make the switch to the IT field. So far, so good.

Now things progress at a higher paste at my current job: They have offered to pay for a training program, which I didn't expect. But I'd have to it in my free time, i.e.  a monthly training session Friday to Sunday. The certification program is great, and I would have enrolled myself, if it hadn't been canceled due to covid last year. There are two paying options for the certification: 900 Euro if the employer pays, 450 Euro if I pay myself. The latter one I can definitely afford. (I read that training agreements sometimes have clauses that require the employee to stay longer at the company. And of course the employer has to pay back the full fee, if they quit earlier than expected, which is also fine by me.)

I still intend to quit my job, because this work field just isn't for me. But until I'm done with the IT program and until my work contract ends (late 2022), I want to expand my skill set to have a better resume. So I also want to do the company training.

Do you have any advice on how to approach my supervisor, that I'd be willing to pay for the (company) training myself? Without being too obvious about me not wanting to stay there after my contract ends?"

18,What should I do with career if Uncle buying me a house anywhere?,careerguidance,"Hey guys, 30m here. From Southern California. I am working a remote job making $60k/yr. I am an account manager. Have a Business BA with recruiting experience as well which I didnt enjoy doing. I have about $20K saved. I dont like California at all (let alone the fact of the cost of the area), so ive been been working remote in Colorado and kind of traveling the country renting airbnbs to stay at a week or month at a time. 

My Uncle has an inheritance and he has no kids, so he told me he will buy a house/condo anywhere I want to live in the country. The deed will be under his name I believe but it will be ""mine"" as I can rent out rooms, sell it down the line to buy another place, etc. He is going to pay up to $450,000 CASH. I mentioned to him it may be smarter to invest in a couple properties with a down payment but he is adamant he wants to do all cash. In the meantime, he is giving me $1000/month until he buys the house because that is the interest he is making from the sitting cash. 

Thinking about renting out rooms for airbnb as well. And potentially buying another property down the line so I will be able to be financially free going the airbnb route maybe rental arbitrage as well. Not sure if I should use his money for a duplex or something to maximize revenue. 

He wants to get me a place once I finally pick a city to settle down in, get a job, etc.  Which may take a couple years. I guess I am in a paradox of choice. I find too many options in this amazing country and am realizing I cant settle down or date the way I am going. I traveled to Tennessee and the Carolinas in the past few months.  I love it there but realize being near the mountains in the great west is huge for me as I love hiking and backpacking. I just dont know about Colorado. Not to mention that 450K is about the average price here and that isnt even for the ""scenic"" areas. I would love to travel to Montana, idaho, etc soon. 

The only other factor is that I work remote, but there is talk about my work sending us back in part time to the office in Southern California to work part time (2-3x a week) in the next couple months. I definitely dont want to be in CA long term. I was going to ask them to continue working remote. We have a couple employees who have always been remote in Oregon and Arizona and Ive heard that we dont even have tax setups in any other state besides those if those states are even an option for me at all (because when they first began they were remote even before the lockdown).  If they say no to remote, I would consider going back in the office for 4-6 months to save up and then quit and move. If I can work remote I would think that opens up options for cities to live in that there isnt a job market in. But although this job is easy (work 7-4 but only have about 4-5 hours of actual work) and im relatively good at it, I dont find any passion in it and worry if I pick a place in a remote area to live in, what would I do to find a job if I leave this one. 

I want to settle down but at the same time im finding it hard. 

Not really sure what Im asking, just for general advice. Thanks."

21,Should I list every job on my CV?,careerguidance,"Here is my list of jobs: 

Steady employment 2002 -2007. 2nd place of employment 2007-2012. Went back to school 2012-2014, completed some part time freelance type jobs during school, mostly did not work. June 2014-Jan 2015, 1 job, not a good fit. Jan 2015 - July 2015, different job, not a good fit. July 2015 - Sept 2017, regular job. Sept 2017 - August 2018 - regular job, not really a good fit. August 2018 - current, regular job, still employed, working in management role. 

I would like to get a different job but I am concerned about (1) the number of jobs I've had - I get the feeling that a company may feel I will only stay a short time and move on; (2) should I list ALLLLL these jobs on my current CV? Just ones relevant to my field? List the others as ""short term employment""?"
22,Quitting my first tech job over a career change in Graphic Design?,careerguidance,"I (23) really dislike devving. It's torture to me. It makes me really unmotivated, working as a junior dev on auto-pilot for two years. To the point that coding gives me panic attacks and screws over my body, and I might actually get fired soon because of technical inconsistencies. I'm really trying though, to the point that I wake up at 1am throughout the day just to fix some bugs and still not getting it. It's only bearable because my colleagues are there.

I'm considering quitting this year, switching to something that I think I can make a career out of, makes me confident, and I'm really good at: graphic design. I saw my old portfolio and I can still recreate some of them on a whim.

I didn't apply for graphic designer because I didn't have a good equipment to experiment with digital art (my computer specs really sucks). I only took the tech job for money. 

Pandemic is one thing, but what I'm really worried about is ""what if I'm not good enough at this job that I won't be able to afford mum's med bills?"" I tried saving, but most of it goes to my mum's treatment. If I get sick and hospitalized it's basically game over to me.

I tried the 'git gud' method in coding, but it makes me overthink, that my stupid brain makes me think ""you're so not gonna get this, buddy"", and just decreases my morale on the long run.

Should I quit, or should I keep on going?

I need a reality slap. Anyone would do the honors? Thanks!"
23,Should I Include a cover letter if it was not specifically requested?,careerguidance,"I didn’t want to make the title super lengthy so I’ll add more context:

I was browsing job postings on Craigslist and one job I am interested in states instructions at the top to apply, review the job description and email the resume. It says nothing about a cover letter, which normally I would just include anyways, except this job posting doesn’t even list the company name so it would be hard to right a good cover letter considering I can’t get a good glimpse of what the company is like.

Should I even bother writing a cover letter?"

25,What should I do after maternity leave? Unhappy at current job,careerguidance,"So I am 30 years old. Went back to school for accounting and graduated in 2020. Since that summer I've been working remotely as a fund accountant. In short, I haven't learned much of anything and feel like if anything I'm forgetting what little accounting I learned in college. Classmates who found work are saying they are learning being challenged etc. Pay is also not good. Before I went back to school I was a waitress and property manager for apartments. My husband and I are having a baby in May and the work from home aspect is really appealing. I also get good leave and don't want to mess that up. I guess my question is how do I move forward after my maternity leave is up? I'd like to start a new job by end of year. I don't know if any traditional accounting roles are for me anymore. Feeling discouraged and behind. I get lot of recruiters on my LinkedIn since adding this current job but I'm hesitant about those. Advice please."
26,Unhappy and stuck at job,careerguidance,[removed]
27,Should I mention during a job interview that I've already given notice to my current employer?,careerguidance,"Hey y'all. I submitted my formal resignation to my current job last week, and I will be leaving at the end of the month. I quite without having another job lined up because this position is absolutely ruining my mental health and I have substantial savings and a support system to help me during a job search. Yes, I realize this was a risky decision, but it's done.

I submitted a bunch of job applications over the holidays because I knew that I wanted to leave my current role. I had a phone interview last week that went very well and I have a Zoom interview tomorrow. I wouldn't plan on mentioning that I already quite my job, except that I think my end date at my current organization will likely show up if they give me an offer and do an employment verification. I think it's likely the process would not wrap up before the end of the month (i.e. when I leave my job) since there would be at least one more interview after the one tomorrow. Maybe if they ask about my availability, I can say that I'm leaving my current job at the end of the month and could therefore start any time in February? If they want details, I'd probably tell the truth: my current position is not a good fit and I want to commit 100% of my time to looking for something better. 

Obviously, I'm worried they might not like that I've already resigned from my job. I certainly don't want to give the impression that I assumed I'm a shoe-in for their position. I had given my informal resignation before even being offered a phone interview. 

So, any advice on how to handle this issue? Would it look bad if I don't mention anything and they see during an employment check that I just quit?"

Was told by the recruiter that I would hear their decision by certain date, that date came and went. . It's been 1.5 weeks, I sent the recruiter a follow up email and haven't heard anything.

32,How can I stop comparing myself to others?,careerguidance,"I'm a very extroverted person and have a big surrounding. Most of my friends and family are very successful people and pursuing great careers. I feel like a failure every time I compare myself to them.

I am a political science major that Intends on pursuing a masters to work in the field of policy analysis and eventually becoming a foreign service officer. I already have a part time job in the government while finishing my studies so I got that going for me. However most of my friends are engineers, my brother too, my girlfriend is studying medicine and I know so many people pursing great things like PharmD, dentistry or anything stem related. Being surrounded by people like that makes me feel like a big failure. Especially when compared to my girlfriend, it kills me inside as I am a very ambitious person but I still feel as I am heavily judged by people for not pursuing something like engineering or in healthcare. 

I love all my friends and my girlfriend, they treat me very well and this does not come from them telling me these things, it's all in my head. However I can't get rid of this feeling inside of me of feeling like a loser just because I'm not studying something very important/stem etc.

I don't know what to do, I'm confident I'll have a great career as I have plenty of work experience and my GPA is good enough to be admitted into a masters. But I still keep feeling like a failure nonetheless.

I just wanted to get this off my chest,

These are all very doable things, however my department head turns all of them down because he feel they will take too long to implement and the problems I am solving aren't important enough.  If I am being honest, I  he turns them down because he has very little understanding of our engineering programs and systems.  Plus to his personally, yes, they are not important problems because he deals more with employee disputes and pushing product though.  He doesn't care about cutting costs or creating business.  I feel like I need to create a legit proposal report and send to the VP regardless of his opinions.  Is there a way that I can do this professionally and respectfully?"

50,Company I now work with won't give me a contract or pay taxes?,careerguidance,"Unfortunately, this takes a little bit of explaining: 

I live in Ireland and recently got a remote job with a start-up German company (I do not know exactly if they are registered as a Germany company as there is very little information about them online other than a Linkedin account and a minimal website). I got the job in September. 

When I began the process with this company, everything seemed to be following a normal procedure. I was interviewed multiple times and told I was successful in my application. I asked in the meeting (when I was told I got the job) what was the situation with tax (i.e did I pay tax to my country, or to there's etc. as this is my first remote job so I wasn't sure how it worked). The CEO of the company told me that they would speak to his accountant about the tax situation, and when I asked about the contract, they told me that they knew security was important to me and they would be getting contracts sorted as soon as possible.

I asked about the contract again in a meeting in November and was told that another employee (who lives in Germany) was able to get a contract as the CEO used a family members company to contract him on that (I was wondering did he mean so he could pay taxes? But I don't know that was all he said) and that they would try get me sorted soon. 

In addition to all this, I was initially offered 1,500 a month, and that had the potential to go up provide I was producing quality work. A month after my first paycheck, I was told I would be doing half the work for half the money until things got better in the company. Could anyone give me advice on what the best thing to do is?

In addition: 

I know, of course it was stupid of me to leave my old job and take a new one without a contract, but I was honestly just very excited about the job and put down the lack of contract/tax organisation to them being a start up company and just not having everything fully organised. They were shady about talking about the taxes or the contract so I thought it actually would get sorted quickly."

52,I started a job at the same company/office as my sibling and regret it massively. Help. How long do I stick it out for?,careerguidance,"So due to the pandemic I was unemployed for a while (hospitality) and started a new job in a corporate office 3 weeks ago. My sibling sent me the role and talked me into applying (I thought it was a bad idea for us to work at the same place) and I got the role. Long story short, my hang ups about working at the same place rang true, even though we don’t work in the same department or team. I’m worried that it will seriously damage our relationship, especially as she’s been acting very stand-offish towards me outside work. I’m super annoyed and wish I’d never taken the job, but felt pressured to because I was unemployed and was told “beggars can’t be choosers” when I voiced concerns before accepting the job. 

I want a new job, pronto, but I’m worried it’ll look bad if I quit and move so soon. 

How long should I stick it out? Or should I just start applying now?

54,Courage to ask for a sign on bonus?,careerguidance,"
Hello all! I have been in my position for a few years and made solid connections at another facility (I work in healthcare) where I applied and interviewed for my dream job. That being said, I know I am the top person (out of 3) that applied for the job and know I can make the program better. I wanted to ask for a sign on bonus because I will be moving and have some expenses that I can not cover at my current salary.

Has anyone else received a sign on bonus from a healthcare group? How much did you receive and how did you go about asking for it?

Thanks in advance!!"
55,Why be confrontational? Is it ego? To make me feel bad?,careerguidance,"For context:

1) my actual boss never interviewed me
2)I had applied and got a job for a different position

4) I am grateful they kept me
Employed during covid, I am grateful we tried to make it work

5)I addressed my desire to go back to my original role on separate occassions and was met with a variation of “well,
There are no other roles here” 

However, why not just say “I understand and wish you luck”

To say “oh your new job is not what you applied here for…” … well my CURRENT
Role was not the job I got hired to do,I accented it but did voice that I wanted to go back to what I was originally hired to do… 

Is it ego? Or why? What does that remark add to the conversation?"

58,Fresh graduate with a Business Administration degree. What steps I should be taking to start a career?,careerguidance,"I'm not sure if there's a better sub to post this to but I'm already lost. For some context I just graduated in December with a Bachelor's in Business Administration with a concentration of Management and I'm in the Southeastern United States. I just moved from where I went to school back into my parents home for the time being to save on rent until I get a job. 

With the context out the way here's my issue... I've been applying for jobs on Indeed for roles such as administrative assistant, manager trainee programs, logistic coordinators/assistants, and business analyst roles. I've put in 50+ applications in the last 2 weeks that I moved back (which I know isn't too many in the grand scheme of things) but now it's gotten to the point where I've applied for every entry level job with these roles and have been denied for every one. I've had a few interviews that I thought went well but I guess not good enough. I'm not sure what to do next considering I've already applied for everything in my area other then to lie on my resume and say I've got at least a year in some kind of admin field and put down a friends phone number for a reference.

I've had multiple people look at my resume and say it's very good but I know the main issue employers are going to have is that I don't have any experience other then working at restaurants because that's all I had time to do while I was in school to pay for my apartment at the time.

 I have expressed some mild frustration but I would love some advice on how to express  that I need a concrete timeline for career advancement or I  will look for other opportunities.

To give context, I'm a very driven person who's always trying to progress in industry and travel when I can, but having sit down and weighing up my options for my future the only thing I can estimate is unhappiness solely due to the career I'm in (pipefitting &amp; mechanical fitting).

64,Junior Accountant in need of advise. Should I quit my job and peruse education? - UK,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I'm 24 and currently an Assistant Management Accountant at an SME with over 3 years post university experience. I am studying towards CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants).

I am considering handing in my notice without another job lined up and taking some time out so either 6 months by which time I'd be a part-qualified accountant (worth 35k starting) or take a full year off work and just get the qualification done (starting 45-50k).

My current job pays a measly just under 22k when I've seen similar assistant accounting roles with a few years of experience paying 28-30k in my area. My job since it has not been mandatory in recent times is not allowing me to work from home at all and the study support which the recruiter duped me into thinking is fantastic is only the book and a question bank per exam (worth £250..).

As the studying has been difficult and slow with being tired going to the office everyday I feel like I want to finish this ASAP and not spend my 20s declining friends events as I'm ""too busy studying this weekend"".

I have been good with saving and my investments and current account in total are worth just under £60,000. I live at home, pay £100 a month rent, cheap 10 year old car not on finance and my only other financial obligations are my phone contract and gym membership (food at home).

I understand this is a lucky situation as most people qualify while working (takes forever even in 30s).

I have just tested the water and barely applied and already got 2 final interviews soon. One is a remote job 27k and the other is 1 day a week office the rest remote 30-35k. I am led to believe that finding a job in south-east UK in my field isn't a problem.

Would it be wise to quit my job (With my savings the juice time wise isn't worth the squeeze at this job) and study full time using my own money to fund classrooms even it if sets me back 6-7k in total and then just get a better job (or even while studying)? Or do you guys suggest not taking time off? My only concern is the potential ""Career Gap"" future employers may see. But with minimal time and study support I am so tempted just to get it over and done with and move on with my life.

Many thanks! :)"

66,How to make the most of a mentorship?,careerguidance,"I (M27) got a job at a community bank in mid 2021. Everything seems pretty nice so far, not too difficult, and from what I can tell there are plenty of opportunities to set yourself apart. I've done what I usually do at previous jobs. I take on extra work and try to learn as much as I can.

Differing from previous workplaces, the bank offers a mentorship program for low level employees to connect with more senior ones and get guidance. I signed up, interviewed with the board, and a few weeks later in November 2021 found out they matched me with a mentor and that we would connect soon. For context, I am a personal banker 2 (basically a csr with minor supervisor responsibilities) and my mentor is a VP level commercial loan officer.

So we meet and have lunch a week later, I thought it was a pretty decent meeting despite the initial awkwardness. No clue if he thought the same. Problem is: that was back on November 12th. Absolutely no communication since then on my part or his.

I'd like to change that, but have no clue on how to take initiative on it. To be honest, I like him and think I can learn a lot from him, but we don't have much in common beyond that. Does anyone have any tips on connecting with a mentor? Or perhaps tips on making the most out of a mentorship?"

69,Starting Over with a Second Bachelors?,careerguidance,"Hi.  
I am 23, graduating in a California state animation program after this spring but, am realizing that I don't feel that I am in the place I want to be in life. I've spent my whole life here but, I just feel I am tired of the self centered LA culture and climate and think I want to do more something more practical and fulfilling with my life.   
I even got offers to work in animated commercials after college, but I would have to settle with the LA traffic, high housing prices, five roommates, and unbearable heat. I keep imagining that I am going to pass from heat stroke one day due to the increasing record breaking heatwaves and ever breaking air conditioners. And when I complain about these quality of life issues, people treat me like I'm crazy to think of leaving.  
I considered doing a MA/MFA program and get into professing or administration, but the biggest animation hubs are only in Los Angeles, Canada and France. But, I am not sure if I want to settle down in these places.  
SO, I am thinking about getting a BA in either psychology(completely switch fields) or finance(would supplement my art degree) and essentially starting over in Washington state. I have quite a few reasons why I'd feel that Washington would suit my needs better: ethnically diverse, scenic, more active lifestyle, cooler, and larger and cheaper housing.   
But I keep reading that getting a second BA would be a waste of time and money.   
Considering my goals, would any of you have any advice on this?"

72,is my boss trying to get me to quit? is my situation salvageable?,careerguidance,"sorry if this is long or irrelevant but i could really use some guidance here. 

my boss lashed out at me last week about something he thinks i did wrong at work, and has just been super cold since then. i’m not getting any valuable tasks assigned, not getting my questions answered, and i’m 50% sure that my tasks are being assigned to my counterparts in a sub-team.

this is what confuses me tho, i have been working here for almost 2 years now, i’ve had a perfect track-record and a healthy relationship with my boss where he’s previously told me multiple times that i’m someone he really trusts in the team. i’m a copywriter so most of the feedback i receive on my performance is based on subjective opinions, unless my copy is factually wrong or delivery is late (the former of which it was last week for the very first time). in my defence, we’re a big team at a start-up, and my boss has a number of people working under him reporting from all of the different countries the service is operating in — as a result, we usually fail to receive actual direction/brief when handed a task and we are trusted enough to roll with it. another thing is that i really believe you can’t avoid mistakes all the time, and me slipping this once shouldn’t really be a reason for my boss to just be acting like a jerk with me and being his usual self with the rest of the team. 

i could be wrong in what i’m thinking — i could be overthinking the situation or i could also be underestimating it and in reality i might actually be in deep shit, but i don’t know what to do, and being treated like this at work when i want to be 100% honest with my job is making me absolutely miserable. this is my very first job, and it doesn’t help that i’ve worked all of it remotely so i really don’t know what the correct thing to do is in this situation. 

i really like what i do, i really like the company and my role so it’s stressing me that its come to this. but spending the workday only waiting to be assigned a task or reached out for work is making me feel super undervalued, and like a fraud. to be on the safe side i have been going crazy applying at 50 other places everyday (with which by the way i have had absolutely 0 luck — no responses, no offers)."

79,Should I go to PA school or try to get a different masters?,careerguidance,"Hi! 23 years old (USA) with a Bachelors in Biochemistry. I work in clinical research currently and have a little over a year of experience in the field. My main goal after graduation was to become a Physician Assistant so I began working in clinical research to gain healthcare experience to apply. I figured clinical research would be a great field to fall back on if PA school didn't work out for me, but after I switched into my new position as a coordinator I began to realize I hate my job because of the massive amounts of paperwork which multiplies depending on patients

 I also began to realize that I may want to leave the US in the future. 

I love patient care and would love to become a provider but the burnout worries me. I also am concerned about how being a PA would translate in other countries. I'm pretty sure that degree would be useless if I wanted to move to, let's say, Germany. 

I really believe that being a PA would make me the happiest, but I'm not sure if this would work out long term. My parents want me to finish school sooner rather than later so they can retire. I figured I could even go to PA school initially and work on another masters later if I do end up deciding to leave the country but I'm not even sure what I would want to do since I don't feel like I would enjoy clinical research anymore. 

Are there any other masters degrees in the medical field that would lead to 6 figure jobs (USD) in both the US and other countries?"
80,What would be a good higher level career for someone who enjoys being a receptionist?,careerguidance,"I am currently working as a veterinary receptionist and surprisingly this has become my favorite job I’ve had so far. I never thought i’d enjoy an office job and tended to try jobs that were more hands on including: being a preschool teacher, kennel technician and phlebotomist. I ended up hating all of these, and the stress was too much for me. 

Here is what I enjoy about my current position: 

-I like that i am allowed to sit down during the day and not constantly on my feet. 
-I enjoy typing communication notes and writing emails. 
-I like that I have a list of things that need to be taken care in general but I work mostly autonomously and can sorta plan my own day out for which tasks I need to tackle first. 
-I like getting to work on a large variety of tasks each day, it’s a good balance of talking to people but also getting to work quietly on emails or attaching documents etc. which allows me time to recharge socially.
-I like that it’s pretty low stress/pressure. Obviously every job has its stressors but this is nowhere near as scary as when I was in charge of caring for people’s kids all day or properly performing a blood draw while someone watches me. 
-Overall, I don’t have a ton of responsibility. When I go home, I clock out and don’t have to think about work.
-It is generally quiet and comfortable from a sensory perspective at my job. Not a lot of loud noises and I don’t have to ever “get my hands dirty” so to speak. 

I love my job but I can’t help but think I cannot survive on this income forever. I am wondering what types of careers I could do that pay better but are somewhat similar to my current position. I am willing to go to school, but would prefer to only do a 2 or 4 year degree."

I have basic skills in coding (I've taken one Data Structures class and AP Comp Sci), am pretty good at Spanish, and I enjoy math, but I haven't really taken enough classes in any of those areas to be intern-able. Thus, I'm just thinking in advance about what kind of summer job I might be able to have. I will have massive debt coming out of college, so it'd be nice to earn some money in my free time, even if I don't end up with a paid internship. The only thing is...I'm disabled. I have EDS which affects my joints from the hips down. I can stand/walk for short periods of time, but I really have to be sitting or else my hips, knees, ankles, and feet begin to get inflamed. 

In HS, I worked as a cashier for 2.5 years, but I was constantly in pain and I can't work at a job like that again. I also tutored for a little over a year, but there was virtually no work over the summer, since parents really only want to pay a tutor while school is in session. I also worked at one of those tutoring centers (Kumon) but I was paid slave wages for mentally exhausting yet monotonous work. I also worked at a center teaching children to swim for slave wages yet again and as a shy introvert I just could not pretend to be a bubbly extrovert for those kids without wanting to cry everyday.

My initial idea would be to work as a waitress or bartender or something, since I know I could pull in maybe $20+/hr, but with my physical condition, it's just not realistic. Could I get hired doing data entry or something for 10 weeks? What are my options? Thank you."

How do I navigate this?",careerguidance,"I got a job at a university and my position was created to help my manager as she's so busy. However, I'm finding it hard to learn from her. There's literally no one else in my administrative department to ask for help.

Her time is very limited because she's so busy, and she speaks 100 miles a minute, such that there is rarely an opportunity for me to jump in to ask questions, and she often gives a lot of backstory/detail *except* when it comes to instructions. Her instructions are really rushed and all over the place. I don't think it's intentional, but she's not very clear and when I try to ask clarifying questions, I get a lot of ""I think we've gone over this before/I've mentioned this before"". I take lots of notes but she just talks so much so fast and doesn't really tell me how to do something, that my notes are as messy as the meetings feel. I don't know what's important and what's not so I just try to jot down as much as I can.

She also doesn't remember half the time if she's told me something already or not so I'm sure there is a lot she thinks she's explained that she hasn't actually. She has the kind of speaking voice that's very clear but also makes you feel like a complete idiot for not understanding something the first time. Probably not intentional but I can't tell. 

I have a big task she told me to wait until the new year to begin and to not send anything until we met about it. We didn't meet until today, and she said I should have already started to do XYZ. Meanwhile I was firstly not told to do XYZ, or told how, and was also told to not do anything until we met to discuss it.

I just feel like she expects a lot of foreknowledge when she knows I am not familiar with this department and its procedures, and seems to expect that I know how to do everything she knows how to do already. I just feel anxious like even taking all these notes and asking for clarification leaves me feeling blindsided.

How do I navigate this? I've never had a manager like this before. I know what the end results are, but she is very particular about how to do things and when and exactly which way but it's just not clear and there's not enough time to get what I feel I need to succeed here"

\- What are your covid protocols? Is it socially distanced?  
\- How much of the day do you spend sitting vs standing or walking?  
\- How likely do you think it is for the contract to be extended to full time? (recruiter said they might extend contract or make you full time)  
\- How much mandatory overtime is there typically? (description mentioned this and I want to make sure they're not gonna have me at work for like 60 hours every week)

I'd be going in blind with no knowledge of IT whatsoever other than just basic computer stuff. Where exactly should I start if I want to make this a career?

The more I think about it the more it makes me upset, I'm cleaning up other peoples unwanted and discarded items. and non stop all day people are driving past.

It's really getting to me after 2 days. I came home and literally started crying uncontrollably (I'm 21 I've never cried in a long time) I don't cry. 

I'm not actually learning anything I feel like my life has started going downhill within two days and is this what the rest of my life is going to be? Cleaning up stuff :(
This isn't the whole of the job but I don't think I'll be doing much more interesting stuff to be honest, any opinions on what I should do? 

Don't know what to do now..."

108,In a pickle. Keep the easy job or choose a hard one to build a career?,careerguidance,I make an above average wage with very little work. Sometimes I’m busy but most days my phone is dead before lunch because I’m always on Netflix or Reddit. It’s a super sweet gig but here’s my dilemma. Without giving up too much information and remain anonymous I’ll say I work in the tech industry and leave it at that. At my current job it’s different than normal day to day duties for my job title. I’m 30 and my fear is down the road say 33 or so I wanna go somewhere else the prospective employer would expect me to know certain things pertaining to my job title and I haven’t needed to do much of it so I would be 35 or so without knowing much. That’s my fear. I have an opportunity to change departments and learn something else that would be harder but I wouldn’t have that fear.
109,Would it be better to go for a Bachelors degree in CompSci or Masters when you already have an Economics degree?,careerguidance,"I do have an Economics degree but my results are not the best. Truthfully I do not see myself in this sphere at all. I want to learn Computer Science but I am unsure whether I should go for a Bachelors or a Masters... or maybe if I should go for bootcamps and certificates.


My Bachelors degree I got in another country and am planning on immigrating to the US. The cost of education and the fact that my Economics degrees performance and GPA leaves much to be desired and that puts me in a bad spot.

110,Am I just a bad employee?,careerguidance,"I’ve had two “real” jobs. Worked plenty of fast food and retail growing up but 2 jobs after college using my degree. My first real job, my boss told me he was disappointed because I didn’t take initiative. I would just sit in silence and wait for my boss to instruct me what to do. I decided to change that for my current job. Since day 1 I am actively seeking out ways to get more work done and actively trying things to see if they work. However, taking initiative has done nothing but bite me in the ass. It’s been 4 months and every time I take initiative I end up making a mistake (not because I screwed up but because nobody taught me the correct way in the eyes of corporate and it’s hard to explain but there was no way I could’ve know this correct way by asking questions. Someone would have had to direct me on it). I feel like a moron and feel like everyone thinks I suck at my job. It makes me want to just do the bare minimum from now on. What should I do about this?"

113,Give up my plans for a good opportunity?,careerguidance,"I’m an undergraduate student, with a part time government job in my field, which is economics. I don’t mind it, but I don’t really love it. I got offered a full time position for the summer but I was looking forward to taking some classes, travelling and exploring some alternate career paths instead. I am worried that if I reject this offer I am giving up a good opportunity, even if it won’t make me happy. I don’t want to settle for something that I don’t like but I am also scared of the ‘graduating with no job’ scenario so many student experience. Does anyone have some advice for this situation?"
114,How do I make sure this internship turns into a job offer? And how do I prepare myself if it doesn't?,careerguidance,"Hey everyone, I'm currently a college senior (Finance Major) set to graduate in August of 2022. Luckily my college transcript is practically flawless with almost a 3.9GPA. It's starting to set in that I need to make a plan for after graduation. 

Now, here is my predicament. My target company has offered me a summer internship, that unless it is extended would conclude in August. I have been trying to secure an internship with this company for over a year. I've been passionate about joining their team because I believe in their mission, their benefits are great, pay is great, and they care about their employees. This is information I have gathered from connections I know that work there, as well as former interns that turned down permanent offers since they had not finished their degree.

I'd love to stay at this company after the internship, how can I maximize my chances of being offered a permanent role before the internship is over? From what I know this company loves hiring from the inside and encourages professional development in their employees and interns. I know former interns that were offered permanent roles that were accepted as well. When the recruiter offered me the internship he mentioned permanent employment was a possibility as well. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated! I really want to be at this company after graduation!"
115,Do you think it's a fair statement that smaller companies are more likely to take advantage of their employees?,careerguidance,"I feel like at small companies executives could be making a bunch of money and underpayment their employees. I was wondering if this assumption sounds accurate.

116,Should I change my job?,careerguidance,"We had an yearly review last month (Our company follows Jan to Dec review cycle) I have received best performance award twice in last 3 quarters. I was expecting a promotion this time as my overall reviews have been excellent. (Avoided an operational incidence with my due diligence, automated workflows) 

But my manager changed jobs before the review. And my immediate seniors are fighting for the managers role. Since they would quit if they didn't get a better role, both are being promoted. Guy 1 to managers role. And Guy 2 is being moved to a different team. Both are senior manager's chamchas. Neither of them have done anything great other than BAU tasks in the year.

Now since 2 people from our team (team of 6) are already being promoted, no one else is being offered a promotion. 

My senior manager called me and praised me but in the end he says ""keep doing the same good job you are already doing. And I will promote you next time"" 

Should I change my job? I have around 5 years of work experience as below. 

Company 1. NBFC: 1 Year 8 months

Company 2. Food Delivery Start Up: 1 Year 10 months

Current company. MNC: 2 years

Will my resume get ruined if I change my job as I have worked for close to only 2 years in every company? 

I'm 28. Will this switch impact me badly?

I just started working at my new job at the engineering firm since last year. Workload and downtime are pretty balanced when I started but now there’s a lot more downtime compared as before and I find it very concerning. Because I’m not salaried and I charge a lot of free time on my timesheet. I’m starting to think it’ll affect the company’s payroll when I’m sitting around getting paid to do nothing.

But I am interested in building my own business... Trading stocks and cryptos... Any tips... Also I wanna be financially free by 25-30
124,Is it worth keeping my second job that I abhor?,careerguidance,"I still have my first job almost 10 years after starting it, though I'm not sure why. I am amidst a career change, and found a good part time IT job that doesn't quite pay the bills, but is great for exposure and experience. It is certainly enough to get me by until I can find something more permanent. 

My second job is a grocery store job. The pandemic has been very hard on this industry's workers. Everytime I go into work there I am miserable. All I want to do is leave. I only work twice a week and use the money as supplementary income, but I feel like maybe I could be doing something better with my time to make money. I love saving money which is one of the reasons why the extra income is great, but I have some savings in place and don't plan on using it. (could always use more though) On top of the savings, I have a pretty hefty stake in their stock that I could take out whenever if needed. I make the same per hour as a friend of mine who started at the company just a few weeks ago. 

My main reason for not quitting already is the uncertainty of my how to access my information. It is so much easier to access all of my information while employed. Tax documents, pay stubs, various company related accounts, etc. The 401K I have will also need to be rolled over and the thought of having to do that process makes me nervous. Also, their stock payout is in March, and if I quit I'm not sure how I'll access that information. 

My ultimate goal is to pass the second half of my A+ certification, and apply for remote jobs like crazy. I was planning on quitting my jobs anyway for the summer if my plans work out as hoped. A remote job will allow me to have income during my summer activities. Before the summer though, I would like to find time to work on a few of my personal goals. 

So with all of the backstory info, my ultimate question is... Should I keep a job that I abhor only to make a little bit of extra money, or should I try to do something in the meantime that is more worth my time?"

130,Change focus on LinkedIn because of resume?,careerguidance,"Hello

I'm trying to become a freelance translator/interpreter. I have a full time job at the moment, but I don't want to work for other people anymore. After graduating as an interpreter I found a regular job where I could use my languages daily. Now, for my translator's resume I need to focus on my experience in translating and interpreting and though it was a big part of my job, I wasn't literally hired for it. My LinkedIn page mentions my normal job title and a short summary that mentions I was the go-to translator, interpreter and revisor. So if a translation agency would read my resume and then check LinkedIn, it wouldn't say exactly the same... 

I want to advertise myself a bit more as a freelancer on LinkedIn, but I have my current colleagues and boss on there. I am absolutely allowed to be part-time self-employed as long as it doesn't influence my normal working hours, but they don't know about my ""side gig"" and as I said I mentioned I want to become 100% self-employed one day.

138,How should I reply about my ongoing Master's program in interviews for jobs that demand a lot of dedication?,careerguidance,"Hello!

I have an interview in a few weeks for a trainee position, and I've decided to put a lot of effort into doing well in this process, if only for the experience (competition is crazy high, so I'm trying to be realistic about my expectations). I'm also pursuing a Master's degree right now. Honestly, I should have finished it already, but I've had some issues related to infrastructure during the pandemic, and that means I'm aiming to finish it by December.

I still want to maximize my chances of advancing in the recruitment process. A question that will inevitably come up is ""what I'm doing right now"", at which point I'll have to mention the Master's, and then I feel like either I'll be immediately removed from the process, or that the interviewer will ask me ""how I'll conciliate both the Master's and the trainee program if I am selected"".

My plan would be to take time off the Master's program for at least six months to dedicate myself to the trainee, but wouldn't that give the impression that I'm willing to pause a thing just because a better one appeared? I could also say that I'll dedicate myself to both, but I feel like that would be worse, and that would give them the idea that my attention will always be divided between two things.

Does anyone have advice on how I should handle this subject in interviews? Thank you."

I work at a family owned insurance brokerage. (Owner is my uncle)

I’ve been with the firm for 4 years. ( 27 years old) Spent the first two working in Implementation and Account Services to learn the business.

The last two I’ve been in a Sales role and still handling all the Implementation work for our clients.

My first year doing sales was amazing I increased my overall compensation almost 45%! 

This last year did not treat me as well, I added two tiny accounts and retained 100% of my existing business. (Not the end of the world)

The last 6 months though have been rough (in both my personal &amp; professional life) and I’m seriously losing my drive to get new business which I’m responsible for generating entirely on my own. 

The firm has a zero dollar marketing budget. Ive never been given leads, there’s no CRM or any tools that help with Sales. Not to mention we don’t have a functioning website and our domain name ends in .org. 

I’m not saying any of those are what has caused my poor performance but it certainly makes prospecting harder than it could be.

The real issue I’m having is with my boss and his disinterest in growing the business. He’s never given me a quota, doesn’t ask me to track sales metrics, and is a massive distraction if he comes in the office. 

I’m the lone rep in our office (with zero formal sales training) and all of this is starting to make me hate my job / industry but mostly question if I’ve picked the right mentor. 

Im unsure if talking to him would change anything and am thinking I need to jump ship.

I’ve starting to look for new jobs and am worried about the nonexistent quota history / changing industries.

Everyone else i work with are all teenagers who work this job for a bit of extra cash while they are in college.

I'm applying to other jobs every single day but i'm getting nowhere. I don't qualify for any of them. And no jobs appeal to me either. I'm sort of just picking a random job out of a hat and choosing this to apply too just so I can get out of this crappy retail job.

I see the number 11 alot and I know this is a sign of change, hope so I try to see positive in it.

[Hong Kong],careerguidance,"I started at my first job, at an entry level role in a small company of 15-20 people about three weeks ago. I am coming to realize that I may have made a grave mistake in accepting this position for a lot of reasons.

* There is a lack of mentorship, no definite goals or metrics to measure oneself with
* Employees other than the founders are demotivated and lazy, there is a clear lack of energy at work
* No insurance or any other benefits, low pay. I was willing to compromise on this for the right job but this is turning out to be something not sacrificing money for
* I don't believe the company will succeed in launching the product it is supposed to

163,Where can I go next? Account manager to what?,careerguidance,"Hi guys,

Not sure if this is the right platform but I've lost all motivation and seriously need some help.

I'm 23 living in London UK. I used to be a Pastry Chef but due to an incident, I moved away from that industry and went to the first job that would take me (due to bills etc) which was recruitment and naturally after 3 years migrated to B2B Account Management. I've been doing this for 4 years now and lost all motivation.

I really feel it's time to move away from account management as I hate just being a cog. I've changed company and that didn't relight any spark but as im working from home, I'm really struggling to even get the motivation to get out of bed.

I have ADHD if that makes any difference and I love starting projects and seeing them come to light. My last two employers have taken me on to make changes to their current account manager structure and I have loved doing that so something where it is project-based to keep my brain stimulated interests me.

The issue I'm having is knowing what career paths there are for someone with no ""qualifications"" other than a pastry degree and for someone who is in account management without taking a huge pay cut as I have bills to pay and it's not cheap in London.

Any advice on what direction where I could move to would be great.

I just signed up for grubhub and haven't activated it yet cause I'm waiting on the starter kit they send you .

166,How to ask a potential employer for an update on my application when I have another offer waiting?,careerguidance,"In a nutshell

Got offered a job with a late January start date but another job, which I am more interested in, told me they only receive my referee reports this week due to a malfunction in their system. 

My references did their reports in December and somehow the whole application was delayed by weeks. I'm tried getting a rough time of when I would get notified and the only info I got was - 'we will get back to you when we have an update'.

I'm just wondering how I should go about asking them to give me a more concrete timeline because my other job is basically waiting for me to sign my name. I don't want to sign my name for job B and then A gives me an offer a few days later. Or I give up job B in hopes of getting A, to only lose both opportunities.

Is it normal to ask for a more concrete time frame? Is it normal to use another job offer as reason for an update on an application? Would any of this be seen as off-putting to a recruitment manger or team?

Appreciate any advice
Thanks"
167,Should I consider switching fields if I can’t handle the physical pain of my job?,careerguidance,"I’m a 26 year old male in the Midwest. Currently work for a heavy equipment dealer and I’m in charge of the equipment that comes in and out, checking it in when I gets here and checking it out when it leaves and also getting the machines washed and ready to go. While also making sure our shop is clean enough and picked up. 

Well, that consists of being on concrete all day long. I know people do it all the time but a tiny back story. 

I was born with a club foot, which basically is where my foot was turned inward. They did all the corrections when I was a newborn so it’s straight now. Was fine up until highschool when I started taking basketball more seriously. Well, all that practicing basically makes my ankle lock up and have absolutely terrible pain. Well, now that I’m in a position where I’m on my feet for 7 hours of the day, it’s happening more frequently now. It’s one of those things that the pain is not constant. On normal days of non work, I can go to the gym, hike, climb and do normal things. But when I’m on my feet a lot, that’s when it flares up. 

So my question is, should I consider going to an office type job? Idk if that would require going back to school which I’m not opposed to. I’m to the point now where I’m neglecting my gym routine and almost too tired and in too much pain to do anything other than sit on the couch after work. 

I’m thinking about going to see a doctor and inquire about any new procedure they might know about. But even then, being in a climate controlled building where I’m not on my feet all day would be cool. I have plenty of other “manly” hobbies that involve me using my hands lol 

But any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!"
168,Job Salary Range 60k-80k. How do I sell my self to get the higher end?,careerguidance,"Just asking how to market “sell” myself better for an Office Manager position for the higher end of the scale. 

The recruiter gave me a range of 60k - 65k but market research shows that this position in this exact company ranges from 60k-68k. 

Other competitors in the industry 70k-80k.

I want to aim in the sweet spot for 68k or should I aim for 72,500k? 

* I am worried that if I ask to high it will scare them away from an official offer. *

Anyways, I'm thinking about job searching again and well I have sort of a dilemma. The thing is I'll be sort of limited in the amount I can work (but not completely). 

I'll probably have to share a car with my mom and that means whatever job I'll apply for I can probably only work until 2 PM. The thing is most full time positions probably require being there until at least 3, 4 or 5. 

I'm just curious...is it worth applying to full time jobs that require these time frames? Do any of you think that employers might work with me and my limitation and allow me to work less....at least temporarily?

I'm really scratching my head about this. Also, I have access to the car pretty much any time in the morning, so I can work a job that starts at like 7 AM if need be.

Again, I'm just not sure if it's worth it to apply to these full time positions with my afternoon limitation.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you all think? Again, do you think I can find an employer that will take me on full time and allow me to work less, at least temporarily - catering to my schedule?

I really would rather jump in the water full force than work part time and work my way up.

I need some much more risky and adventurous career, but I have no idea what could it be. Unfortunately, military of all kinds is not an option- I'm too old for them in 34, have bad eyesight and injured knee which makes using ladders not easy.

Thinking about pursuing an MBA in Strategic Management, as I would love to be a CFO, CEO, COO one day. I have two bachelors, one in finance, one in accounting from the University of Maryland. From my view, an MBA would benefit me, but only if I get it from a top school like Ivy league. I am thinking Wharton (Penn), Chicago, or Stanford. 

I have not studied at all and took a 52 question GMAT practice test that apparently I did well on.
27/31 = 87% math
16/21 = 76% verbal


In each position I have worked, I often look for possible improvements or inefficiencies. Despite being relatively early/mid career, my improvements have led to attrition decreasing, increased revenue by 2%, lowering DSO from 40 to 25 days. As well as building models for sales to use to further show the value of the product being offered (through savings).

What are your thoughts? Should I pursue an MBA at a top school?"
187,Trains or Planes?,careerguidance,"This post maybe a little long but I appreciate anyone who has advice! Thank you in advance. 

I am at a fork in the road in my life and its about time I make a career decision. I am a 25M was apart of the military for 6 years and completed some college courses but never finished due to money. For the longest time I have always wanted to be a pilot. My father works for a major airline and that is what started my obsession with airplanes and the airlines. Unfortunately about a 7 months ago I found out I have issues with my eye sight and would not pass an FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) medical exam. So my dream was shattered of becoming a pilot. I am currently working at a craft brewery as a bartender and the sales manager. I love this job but know it does not pay enough for me to live off of. (I still live with my parents and have student debt.)

After talking to a few employees of this airline I found a cool position called an Aircraft Dispatcher which essentially does everything a pilot would do except for fly the actual plane. To get this position I would have to become licensed by the FAA. There is a course that is offered near me that is FAA certified and would grant me a license upon successful completion of this course. It is an 8 week course M-F 9am to 2pm meaning I could still work at my current job. Tuition for this course is $4,500. Once completed I would have to work for a smaller regional airline before moving to a major after a few years. Benefits with the airlines are amazing to including medical, dental, vision, and flight privileges (Which is a huge factor for me. ) Average pay starting is $21 an hour at a regional airline and goes up from there. Schedule at majority of airlines are 4 days on 10 hours shifts. This would also require me moving across the country no matter which regional I get hired by as you work from their headquarters. 

Now my other option is in the railroad industry. Trains have always fascinated me. I came across that CSX a major rail/freight company around me is hiring for freight conductors. Great benefits to include medical, dental, vision, and railroad retirement (I hear its one of the best things to have when retiring. Better then social security.) Pay averages $65,000 first year and increases 5% each year for 5 years. 12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. 2 days off in a row if 6 days in a row worked. If I would select this job I would love to become a locomotive engineer and drive the trains. That would be the dream position. I would more then likely have to move with this position as well but not across the country unless I just wanted to. 

If you were in my position what would you do? Which job sounds the best?

There’s another job that I applied for at the same time but has taken longer to get back to me with a final offer. I’ll be having my third face to face interview this week (I suspect the owner wants to hire me but his son prefers the other candidate I’m up against as this second final interview is with his son who will eventually take over the business). This new job pays %35 more, making up the same hours as my other two jobs. I  would be working as the executive assistant for a very well known property developer and the work sounds more interesting than what I’m currently doing. The new job would be super convenient as it’s right around the corner from my son’s new school. I’m concerned because the job is for a 12 month contract to be renewed annually which provides less security. The boss said his old EA worked for 7 years on that same basis of annual contract renewal and he wants someone who will stay long term.

I don’t know if I should accept it if I’m offered the job or if I should just stay where I am even though the pay is less. Is 12 month contract with annual renewal a red flag? I would not be a contractor with my own ABN, I would still be an employee. I want this job but there’s definitely less security than what I have in my current positions.

213,Experienced professional - potential issue with background check?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone.

Wanted to get some opinions on this.

I'm mid career and have had 4 jobs. One for 2 years, one for 6 months, one for 4 years, and my current one for \~1.5 years.

I've received an offer to join a big bank (think Goldman Sachs, Bank of America) on the software side of things. The job that I had for 6 months was completely irrelevant to this new opportunity - no transferrable skillset, just something I wanted to try after college when I was still ""exploring"" myself, and I had no room on my resume (1 pager) if I included this.

I excluded this short 6 mo stint from my resume, and didn't talk about it during any of the interviews.

I will be starting the background check soon and understand that it's probably best to put this job on the background check app, but I didn't put it on the job application on the bank's website.

My question - should I go ahead and list it on the background check? My knowledge is that this is done by a third party (first advantage I believe). Do note that the other jobs have 100% the right start/end dates, I just basically left a gap on the company website job application because I had no space on my resume to talk about it plus my other jobs.

What options are available to me?",careerguidance,"I originally was going for the bachelor’s degree in general biology because I wasn’t sure *exactly* what career I wanted, but thought that the general degree would keep my options open. Also, I was really interested in biology and knew I wanted to have a job involving field work/conservation/wildlife biology. However, most of the entry level jobs require years of prior experience and a master’s degree, both of which I don’t have. 

Also, I’ve developed several chronic illnesses and daily pain that have still not been diagnosed over the last 4 years and feel like I can’t do any field work at this point. I’ve also been dealing with a great deal of depression, brain fog, fatigue, extreme social-anxiety, and fractured sleep. I feel like doing nothing except figuring out what’s wrong with my body and managing my pain. Life right now is just school, stress, and doctor’s appointments.

I also thought about going to graduate school to open up my job prospects a bit more, but I have no idea what kind of program to pursue. I don’t want have a career in research - I have had a few semesters of research experience as an undergrad at a community college and found out that it’s not really for me. I’m also feeling so burned out with studying and I’m unsure if I really want to go to grad school.

Right as I was about to start volunteering in labs at my college, the pandemic hit, and school was moved to online for a long time. So, I have no lab experience, and my school is back online again for the semester because of the Omicron variant, and so I can’t find any labs that will take me in.

I feel like I really messed up. I only have had 1 internship over a summer at a museum, a couple semesters of research experience, no volunteer experience, and absolutely no work experience aside from being a postmates delivery driver. Plus, I’ve forgotten almost all of my statistics and coding since I’ve been busy with other classes over the semesters. I don’t have any skills and can’t provide much value.

The worst part is that I just turned 30 and am about to graduate with a degree in general biology that doesn’t really have any good job prospects unless I go to grad school…but I have no idea which grad school path to take. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, and I’m really worried that my health will continue to get worse (feeling worse with every month that passes), which will definitely impact the kind of work I’m able to do.

I definitely should have thought through this more. I feel so stupid (probably because I genuinely am). I get the feeling I’m just going to be sick and broke with a useless degree.

Can I use the general biology degree for careers that are unrelated to the subject? What other options are available? What about jobs from home, since I am feeling sick all the time? If possible I’d like a job where I don’t have to talk to people very much since I have social anxiety.

I’m feeling so lost and don’t know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

It almost seems to specific and not a career where there are a ton of different job options if I don't like the work.

My other path I am interested in is nursing. I love the idea of working in a hospital but I know it's a tough job. I hate sitting at a desk and I love a workplace where new things happen every day, so I wonder if this my path. Everyone I talk to says not to do it because nursing is so tough, I am not good at math and I have pretty bad coordination (hand/eye). I would have to take some highschool science and math to apply to this.

I feel so lost. I thought counselling/therapist was my career I was working toward and now I feel like I am full of self doubt no matter what I choose. I want to be done a program that I am confident in by the time I am 30 and I feel so behind and kind of lost.

If anyone can help that would be appreciated."
217,Should I switch Career Paths? What if there is no going back?,careerguidance,"Hi all,I'm new around here, but wanted to ask what you guys thought about my current position. I'm 24 with a Masters currently work for a Large Cap Biotech company in NYC area as an entry level non-PhD associate researcher. I make about 80k all in and have a pretty awesome work life balance, max 45 hour weeks ever, and a manager that supports me. It's comfortable, but definitely not what I see myself doing for more than another 2 years.

Basically, I got offered a position at a top bulge bracket (BB) bank as an Equity Researcher (ER) to cover Large-Cap Biotech Stocks (getting official offer letter next week). I am unsure of the compensation exactly, but am expecting about 120-130k all in. The hours in ER are much different, I think its normal to expect 60 hour work weeks (\~80 during earnings 4 times a year). The work is also much different, and honestly I'm not sure that I would really like the work entirely, but I think this is such a unique opportunity that it could really get me away from research where the ceiling without a PhD is too low. I think it would be great to leverage experience working at a top BB covering the industry and ultimately go into Corp Dev, Corp Strat, Investor Relations and such. I have also heard from others that have worked with this manager I would be reporting to that he is a good guy who has a strong track record, very much like my current manager.

Basically, I wanted to know what you guys think about what this opportunity, and how I should really approach this. I know for a fact that I am frustrated every day by the lack of advancement without a PhD and staying in research at the bench would be a life long disappointment."

219,"Seeking guidance, any advice?",careerguidance,"Hey all, apologies in advance if this is a long post 
Small background story:

I am currently 24M and I’ve been jumping around from different career paths all my life. I am trying to find the balance between “find your passion” and “do it because you need money”.  I’m still living at my parents place and I know there’s nothing wrong with it but I really want to grow up and experience living on my own and being financially stable.

When covid first hit the US and peak quarantine kicked in, I was left jobless and really hopeless on where can I find work, let alone finding what do I truly enjoy doing. 

I stumbled across graphic designing and got really good at it. I’ve only been self taught off of YouTube and gained more experience through freelance work to local clients that needed logos or small projects done. I have progressed a lot since I  first started and found that I can spend hours and hours perfecting a design or concept or project and enjoy it. 

Now the reason why I post this here is because I’m seeking guidance with what kind of careers include graphic design or designing overall. It’s all new to me and I keep hearing about UI/UX

I know from my own experience that the difference is UI is user interface so the front end of sites and designing (which I enjoy more then coding) and UX is user experience so coding and back end

Questions I have:

Is there a difference in salary with careers that strictly focus on UI vs knowing how to work with both UI and UX?

Is it worth learning both ends? Or just stick to one? Why or why not?

Can anyone provide advice/information on your own personal experiences, how you got started, and what you do now on a day to day basis?

Any recommendations on career paths I can research into as well as internships or bootcamps?

Thank you for reading and I hope this post can guide me to the start of a creative future!"

224,Should I leave my job after 6 months for something less stable but more of a good learning opportunity?,careerguidance,"I've been in my perm FT job about 6 months. I found I didn't like the company much, nothing wrong just didn't care for the projects and products , culture etc.

Anyway, I didn't plan to stay for more than a year, at least so it wouldn't look too bad on my resume. But I found a job that I am actually quite interested in, similar to my current field but overlapping in another field I've been curious about and wanting to get experience in. Bit of a hybrid role and it looks super interesting.

However it's only a 6 month contract. And I don't know the pay. That said I'm not that concerned because I have plenty of savings and I'm in a very employable field. I mostly want this job because of the type of things I will do and learn. I want the experience and exposure to help me further develop and forge my career path.

Obviously I haven't even applied to this job but hypothetically.. do you think it would be a bad idea to pursue this job after just 6 months at my current role?"

228,"What are some great management and supervisory practices you’ve seen, and what are some ones you’ve seen that didn’t work?",careerguidance,"So I work for a small IT MSP, I was hired 2.5 years ago as the lowest level of what’s called tier One helpdesk. Basically my original role was just “answer the phone and take break fix and shorter tickets to help with call volume and reduce stress on the team when there are techs out on onsite visits”. I was hired cuz of my customer service experience. No tech knowledge at the time.

When I came in there were 6 of us: 1 CEO, 1 System Architect, 3 techs, an office manager, and a sales guy. But everyone sort of wore all the hats. Technicians often made sales pitches for products, my CEO would have to take hours out of his day to go out to a 2 person business to hold their hand through a printer setup. Everyone did everything. 

Since then, it’s grown a little but changed a lot. And I’ve been part of that. With everyone’s involvement we’ve managed to codify the roles in our company somewhat, or at least the responsibilities. And my responsibilities are starting to look a lot like a manager. Some tasks I’ve already taken on from my boss and the office manager because they either didn’t have time to do them, didn’t know how to do them, or thought I would be better at them include:

Ticket assignment and dispatch
Ticket queue management and workflow auditing
Taking and handling escalations
Hiring consultation(I’m about to be pulled into my first interview this month :3)
Performance reviews

I came into this thinking I’d get some hard skills and be that Cool Girl with a Tech Industry Job (tm) but…turns out I’m just better at people than I am at computers. 

My boss has been super supportive of all the change, has rewarded me very well with raises, and has been great about being helpful and not allowing me to take on too much at once. He’s totally on board with me moving into this role, it seems, which is really nice to have as a support system. All the engineers are really receptive too. Other than the SA but I think he’s got other problems with me. 

In any case, my biggest concern is that because I’m building out my role, I have basically complete freedom to do great things with it, or to completely fuck it up. My question is this, because I’ve never really had a real manager role, and this is only my second professional sector job: what are some responsibilities, initiatives, and practices that you’ve seen managers implement that have been helpful and productive, and what processes have you seen managers do that are unproductive, an paying or slow people down?"

I work in the marketing department of a large corporation. The company hasn't really done digital marketing, so I was recently promoted to lead digital strategy. However, a more senior colleague is now trying to take my job. 

Right after my promotion was announced, this colleague reached out to my boss to discuss their team taking over a huge chunk of what should be my new duties. This is happening because their team -- which has nothing to do with digital marketing -- is losing relevance and needs to find ways to prove their value. It is a land grab to give them more power. They don't have the correct knowledge for the role, and their attempts at doing things have been objectively bad. My boss knows this and does not support it. However, the head of our department plays favorites and is going to side with this colleague every time because they like each other. My boss feels powerless in this situation, and I don't really know what to do either. 

I've thought about going through their work and highlighting all the errors or pulling data that shows their ineffectiveness, but I truly don't think it will impact the head of our department's choices. I think they are going to give this person whatever they want for inexplicable reasons. Now, I could take this information over their heads to someone higher up, but I still have to work with these people once it is all said and done. Tearing apart their team is only going to make my work life more difficult.

Part of me wants to quit and be rid of the headache, but I just got promoted two weeks ago. This fight has been bubbling, but my promotion brought it to the forefront. Leaving would save me a lot of stress in some ways, but it's hard walk away from the money, the vacation time, the remote work, etc.

234,Can you suggest a direction for a current teacher who wants to escape education?,careerguidance,"I have been teaching for five years and I'm pretty sure another will kill me at this point. I have a bachelor's in early childhood special education. I have zero desire to be in education anymore at all.

My problem is that I hate everything. All the usual suggestions for former teachers (HR, corporate training, curriculum development) sound appalling to me. I would be terrible at sales. I need to be able to make at least $40-50k. (I would settle for part-time and making half this, but if I'm working full time I need to at least replicate my current salary.) 

I live in a small Midwestern town (50k ish people) so my options are limited. Things I do like:

-writing

-reading

-learning new things

-history

-books

-home decor

-houses

-quiet

-nature

-animals

-small towns

-teaching, but not what education currently is

-working without people breathing down my neck

Any direction would be lovely. I feel like I'm having a midlife crisis. Oh, I would like to also avoid more education because I owe an epic ass-ton of student loans and I'm almost 40."
235,Help me escape teaching!,careerguidance,[removed]
236,What could this mean for me?,careerguidance,"
Long story short: My redesign of my company’s task process system could go company wide if things keep up. 

Long story long(ish):
3 weeks ago I envisioned a better system at work to perform a task. I am always trying to be more efficient in everything that I do and I saw flaws in their system. 

After designing, producing, testing and getting feedback from other people, I had someone tell me “I like your idea but the company isn’t going to like it and you could get fired”

Shortly after, my supervisor told that he liked it and was going to propose it to his supervisor. He was just afraid of the company being upset with me doing it without their permission (all while 2 people are trying to stop him from proposing it)

Later that day I had to present it to his supervisor, which was terrifying. She said basically the same thing, she liked it but now she could get in trouble because she knows about it and I haven’t went through the proper steps. I should have came to them with the idea before I tried it. So she told me to take it all and store it until it’s time to present it (the next week possibly). 

At this point I was discouraged because my system had no apparent issues and was more efficient. Also, other people used my system because it was better so I felt like I let them down.

Right before I got off, I was told to wait before leaving so I could present it to the next supervisor(the 2nd highest in the building who everyone said was the one to look out for). She asked alot of questions and challenged the idea, but I had an answer for everything (because it had been 3 weeks of using it) She also asked why I came up with it so I had to explain my thought process. 

She loved the idea and told me that she was throughly impressed and wanted me to come in the next day so I could do tests on something that she had concerns about, but if everything worked she wanted to get it rolled out right away, to possibly all 6 locations across the US to become the new standard.

Today I designed and conducted 3 different tests (with all of the variables) and evaluated the data of 30 samples, all by myself.

What can this mean for me? Or could it just be a “good job” type ordeal?"

I have about a year and a half of savings and then I need to be in a new career that pays a living wage, so I’ve been looking into certificate programs. 


I did a career workshop (if you like personality tests then I’m an ISTJ in MBTI and a 5 in enneagram), and had some great takeaways from it, but the crux of it is that everything I am suited for (engineering, law enforcement, management, mathematician, etc) all take more schooling than I can afford to do, or the other options like trades or forestry seem to be way too rough for me as a woman (not saying women can’t do these things, but I’m a weakling). 


I’m located in the Pacific Northwest in Canada. Relocation is not an option. And as for returning to admin, working 9-5 in a cubicle is soul-crushing for me.

My question is, should I switch my major this late and attempt to become an economist?

Overall he’s happy.

Yesterday in his bi-weekly 1:1 with his boss, the boss told him “there are no D&amp;A projects in pipeline now. While we try to sell some D&amp;A projects, you might need to upskill in some other field or find new initiatives”. He told her he was willing to do more work out of scope.

What does this mean? Of course naturally we assume the worst but he says he would only follow up in the next meeting if he is too stressed about it."

There are weeks where we are expected to work 7 days in a row (between two weeks so it’s legal) which feels horrible and stressful. I have been scheduled 8 days in a row once and quickly spoke to my manager to fix the error. In a normal week, I am never sure which day I am getting off.

I have every other weekend off with no extra pay and even THAT is not always guaranteed. And because I am still in training, I have weeks that are day shifts with the next week being all overnights

I have worked every major holiday and was even almost denied a measly 5 days of PTO that I scheduled 3 months in advance.

I have seriously considered getting sick with covid on purpose to at least get a break because I feel burnt out only 5 months out and I am seeking mental health counseling, however, I don’t know if this is the reality of full time life and I am just complaining too much.

I had all the relevant experience which she liked but the only reason I didn't get the job is that I'm going to get a bachelor's degree.

Since I’ve been working from home full time my mental health has had an enormous boost, I save so much time and money from not commuting and I use this to exercise and feel better, plus I don’t have to deal with certain people in an office environment who I would avoid outside of work completely.

The issue is there is a culture in my company of “working in the office and being together is so much better” it’s not, and my direct line manager and team that I work with are actually based in a completely different location so when I do speak to them it is via Microsoft teams anyway so there is no difference if I am in my office or at home.

What would be the best way of asking to work from home full time even after the government guidance and restrictions are lifted,  apart from very specific circumstance like meeting clients ect?"
265,Which role suits me best in a startup?,careerguidance,"Hi there!

My time as a university student is slowly but surely coming to an end. I already figured out the work-environment I want to work in, but am really undecided about the career path / role I want to pursue. I hope that if I give you folks an overview of what I did so far and what I think my strengths are, you could point me into the right direction. So here we go:

**Education:**

* Currently doing my Master's (Entrepreneurship) at one of the Top 20 business schools in the world (and the best one in my country).

**Work Experience:**

* Had a drop shipping store before starting college
* Worked part time a real estate investment fund in the fund management department
* Internship in business development at internet platform scale up
* Worked part time in B2B sales (cold calling and so on) for a career social media platform
* Internship in venture development at a venture capital firm
* Internship in expansion / project management at a very hot micromobility startup (Series C)
* Internship in product management at a very hot early stage internet startup (Seed)

**Strengths, Weaknesses, Personality**

My strengths and interests are all over the place.

* My UI design skills are way above average (in my peer group, not compared to professional designers),
* I have taught myself the basics of JavaScript and Python, although I don't really have projects to show.
* I am good with people, in the sense that I have often gotten the feedback that I am a very likable person. I tend to be, if I am in a good mood, the life of the party. But I also have moments and days where I want to see no one and hate talking to people.
* Generally, I am a quite organized person - not naturally, but I have built myself systems that enable me to be.
* I have very broad knowledge, because I had many diverse interests along the years.
* I can learn fast
* I can be very assertive
* I am good with words (in my native language)

**Weaknesses**

* I am generally a very lazy person
* My math skills are not the best
* I tend to get bored quickly
* I fall in love with new ideas, three months later I discard them or get burned out
* I rarely stick to anything
* I often find myself thinking ""what if ...."" (there is something better)
* I was a spoiled kid and therefore probably also don't have a lot of resilience

**Interests**

* Everything and nothing. I can get excited about almost everything. I love to explore new topics, but once I get beneath the surface, my interest wanes or I get feelings of inadequacy (because other people are already better than me)
* I follow the startup world very closely
* I like to read
* I like to make music (make beats or play piano)
* When I was younger I used to do graphic design just for fun
* Human psychology
* Philosophy
* Economics (alas why some companies win and others don't, such as flywheel effects, marketing strategy)

**Work environment**

I know I would like to work in a high-pace work environment in a promising startup, that's fairly early, but not too early. Probably around Series A - C stage and help that company scale further. 

What's a career you think would suit me?"
266,Does it make sense to get an MBA now?,careerguidance,"Hello career guidance.

I am 24m, mechanical engineer currently located on the West Coast US. I have close to 2 years professional experience.

I am wondering if it makes sense to go back for my MBA now based on where I am at in life (no obligations).

The reason I want to get my MBA is I find it very likely I would need it in the future. I hope to move into the more business side of engineering, either management (of people) or product management type role. My fear is that if I wait too long it will be hard to find time to go back to school later when I have kids and more obligations. I realize some companies pay for school (mine doesn’t) but it’s usually not much and requires navigating school and work. I like the idea of biting the bullet and going back full time now and just getting it done.

My hesitation is that I am not in at point in my career where I need an MBA to move to the next step. But again, I feel confident it would only help me in the future.

Does anyone have experience and/or opinions on this topic? Tyia"
267,what community college degree would offer best opportunities for...?,careerguidance,"A person in my situation, I have a degree in architecture, and have worked in architecture for the past ten years. But have found that i am pretty good at the design portion of my job but terrible at the managing and ""socializing with clients"" portion of my job. The latter two being most important to move up and get better pay. Because of this I've been stuck in same position with very little increase in pay. 

This has convinced me that maybe i  might need to look for different career to pursue, but i have no idea where to begin. Are there any lucrative degrees I could get from a community college? Thanks in advance for any advice"
268,Artist small business manager jobs?,careerguidance,"How do you think I could go about finding business manager jobs for small time businesses like artists or small time online boutiques or mom and pops?

Like is there a site for such jobs specifically?"
269,"Talked with boss about growth opportunities. Projects were mentioned, but numbers and title adjustment weren't. I want to have the conversation, but not sure how to bring it up, what questions to ask, or what to expect. What are your suggestions? Has anyone done this successfully?",careerguidance,"Same as above. 

We had a pretty healthy conversation about my being there. I pointed to a lot of projects I completed that were aligned with our companies growth and he agreed. Boss is very ambiguous/unclear with direction so I started respectfully asking questions to get clarification on what he means. Boss suggested a few different types of projects I can take on and some things he'd like to see me take on, but no discussion of numbers or title adjustment yet. 

I want to bring this up with him. I want to make a big ask - 20k plus raise - and title increase to director from associate since my duties are aligned with a director title but compensation and title are associate level. 

I plan to point to market data, responsibilities, future potential, and really sell why I deserve it. I'm okay with hearing no, hearing a different number, but I want to get the hall rolling on the conversation. I don't know how to bring up the ask. Does anyone have experience doing this in the past? Any suggestions from your perspective even if you don't have experience? 

Thanks!"
270,"Are most workplaces understaffed and overworked? Is there any type of company that isn't, and how can you tell when you apply online?",careerguidance,"Right out of university (history degree) I got an admin job at a mid-sized private firm. It paid decently, but management was ridiculously unqualified all the way up to the VP. Micromanaging, disparaging comments about other workers to workers, took on as heavy a caseload as possible with as few staff as possible. My manager was the queen of micromanagement and anxiety who would overwork herself and never take vacations. I tried for years to get out, being told by others to try to work for a bigger company, where things are more streamlined or organized, like working for a university, or the city, or the region.

Well I finally got a job at a university, and was informed that the department I'm in (not academic) is again, understaffed and overworked. The plus is that the pay is better and I'm not micromanaged; the downfall is I'm again working for a manager who has a huge workload and never takes vacations. There is very little support for a new hire.

I'm just wondering, is this the norm? Are there any signs that a company is actually reasonably staffed or not so chaotic when you're applying? And what kinds of companies are the best to work for?

I can't afford to go back to school just yet."
271,Is it normal that I continually have this desire to never work?,careerguidance,"Hello all, so since high school, I have had this constant desire that I never really wanted to work and only wanting to expand upon my interests and hobbies and do them as much as I can. 

Luckily, I did run into the financial independence movement and have learnt a lot from the r/financialindependence and r/Fire subreddits This IMO seems like the best way to go about my desires to not work.

But is it weird that I just never want to work at all?"
272,Should I contact HR or Not?,careerguidance,"I adore being a Dietary Aide and love my current company. Despite this, I am being underpaid for my work (in my area, a Dietary Aide should be making $17.50 per hour, I get paid $14.25). My dream company pays $17.50-$18.25 per hour for the same job I'm doing. They are not currently hiring, but welcome resumes. Should I contact HR directly or call the hospital and speak to the manager? I am a connection with the HR director on LinkedIn."
273,I’m (20F) starting to become unhappy at my apprenticeship I only got 3 months ago. Please can someone take the time to read the below and give me advice?,careerguidance,"The reason it started..
I had an exam coming up, she told me I could do some preparation which I did. 
The next week, I had finished all the work and assumed it would be okay to do exam prep. She then told me off for this, spoke in a rude way about it when she could’ve just asked politely for me to ask her the next time I wanted to do some college work. 
I had no issue with how she wanted me to check first but it’s the way she spoke to me that got to me. 
A few days later she said I had been rude to her in emails because I wasn’t greeting her formally. 
I’m new to an office job as well as the apprenticeship itself. I didn’t know I had to ask to do my college work but now I do and in future I know to ask.  
I also didn’t know I’d have to be formal in emails when we’re sat in the same room. 
Both of these issues she had I made sure not to do them again yet arguments continued and it would always go in circles. They were always started by her. 
Every since I did these 2 things, she has held a massive grudge towards me and it has ended up escalating into other issues that shouldn’t have even been big issues. 


Issues that have came up:
- she had a word with me saying I always have a rude tone with her (i always speak in a normal way but I still apologised)
- Says I speak to other people more than her and I also speak to them ‘nicer’ (I only speak to 1 other person and it is very rare) I still apologised 
- She started conversation with me, I was conversing back but the second I replied back she told me to stop talking as she can’t be bothered. (I once again apparently had a tone???)
- I told her the situation was making me sad, she shouted at me to grow up 
- She has said that I’m not nice or friendly 
- She has mentioned several times about me being at risk of losing my job just because of that 1 time I did college work without asking. She just continues to say it in a way that comes across threatening 
- She said she wasn’t going to train me anymore and that my other co worker could do it but she is now complaining that I don’t come to her when I need help. I do still come to her if I need help but she claims I go to my other co worker ‘too much’ which is not true. I hardly have anything I need help with

- She had a go because I don’t say bye when I go for my break or hi when I’m back. Once again it’s a brand new environment, I’m used to going on my break without any goodbyes or hellos when I come back. She has left several times without saying a word to me. 
- She asked me to do a covid test, I said I would and I did. A week later she raises her voice at me because I didn’t tell her it was negative, she had to ask instead? Said I could’ve been walking round the office with covid. I told her I wouldn’t have came back in if I was positive and she replied yet again raising her voice saying ‘don’t be putting words in my mouth’. She literally just said those words?


Every time I’m approached I feel it’s always aggressive and never her just asking me politely to do something. For example, the covid thing I haven’t heard anything about telling them my negative result but the first thing she said to me about it was her telling me off for it. 

I have always apologised but it goes on and on and on. It has gotten to the point where I’m afraid to speak to her with the worry of it creating another problem. 

I have had another job for 5 years and I have never had an issue with anyone like this. Even when I’ve told other people about my apparent rudeness and my tone, they have been shocked because thats not how I am.  



Has anyone experienced this kinda thing? What even is it? Gaslighting? Manipulation? I don’t even know if it applies to any of those but any help would be great. Thanks."
274,Should I tell my boss if another company is pursuing me and trying to hire me?,careerguidance,"I’ve been at my current job for a year now and am relatively happy, I can’t complain. 
Over the last couple of weeks a company has been pursuing me, I’ve had 5 interviews with them, and yesterday they made me a “soft offer”. It’s a 20% pay raise, along with bonuses, and it allows me to work remotely, they have also given me a detailed outline on how they want to promote me in a year. They are waiting to come out of a hiring freeze next week then are sending me a hard offer letter. Should I tell my current boss now about it? I don’t want to blind side him. Or am I over thinking this?
Any advice would be appreciated"
275,Need advice on if I should tell my boss a company is pursuing me.,careerguidance,[removed]
276,What career path makes sense from here?,careerguidance," I could honestly use some opinions. I hope this makes sense. I have noooo idea what to do next career wise.  I’m nearly 40.  I have about 12 years of experience as a paralegal/legal secretary, and 16 years of administrative experience (a lot of crossover with the legal work.) I’ve worked for some of the largest firms as well as the federal government.  In my younger days, I worked in theatre and as a flight attendant.  In 2018, I craved a change and left a cushy legal job to move halfway across the country and began to working as a tour guide at a historic venue and also as an Operations Manager at a live theatre. They both ended when COVID hit, and a friend got my job as a sales person at an art gallery. The boss is generous so the money is actually really good, I work pretty much by myself, but my lovely boss  is going to retire and close the business in a year, so I’m trying to plot my next move. 

I am lost. I don’t have a degree, but I do have some college experience. To be honest, when I moved down here I took the words “degree incomplete” off of my resume because I wasn’t getting called for any interviews at all. I don’t lie and say I have a degree, but I also don’t say I DON’T have a degree, just the name of the college, the degree I was pursuing, and the years I attended. I made some financial mistakes when I was in my 20’s and ended up with about 50k worth of student loans, despite not having a degree. I DON’T want to put myself further in debt, so going back to college isn’t an option. I only have about 30 credits, so it’s not like I only have a few courses to go.  I am however open to a more vocational schooling or something like real estate, etc. Not real estate specifically, because I know how difficult that can be to get into. Does anyone have any suggestions of career directions I should be considering? I really like working by myself and/or from home. I have a side hustle going organizing closets/pantries, and I like being in charge of my own schedule. I don’t need to get rich, but I definitely want to live a comfortable life, would love to buy a home on my own.  My best friend thinks I should stick with the legal field because I have much solid experience there, but it can be pretty soul sucking.  So...that's why I'm here I guess! Any suggestions or thoughts that might fit the bill would be greatly appreciated!"
277,Should I continue my software engineer career abroad or switch to freelance writing?,careerguidance," Hey guys,

Don't know if I can ask this here, but I'm looking for major life advice. I'm seriously tired of the 9 to 5, yet I have a strong desire to travel Europe and Asia. However, this leads me down two options: a.) Consider my job as a QA Automation Engineer, but look for a remote position with three years of experience under my belt. b.) Switch over to freelance writing.

I've determined the pros and cons of each with the following:

**Pros of software engineering**:

* Already have three years of experience under my belt.
* Easier to get job due to relevant experience
* Very stable source of income
* High in demand worldwide

**Cons of software engineering**:

* Relearn how to do algorithms for coding interviews
* All remote jobs are highly competitive, with most hires being engineers with 5+ years of experience.
* Won't immediately get a stable income due to the interview process and getting hired by a fully remote company
* I may have to relocate to a specific country for a certain period of time before going fully remote
* Requires reliable internet wherever I go
* Schedule conflicts with clients due to different timezones 

**Pros of freelance writing**:

* Make money relatively quickly within first few months. All determines how devoted I am to my business.
* More fluid. I'm able to move to any country wherever I want.
* Sky is the limit. I can niche down in multiple topics after thorough research.

**Cons of freelance writing**:

* Not much money can be made until you get stable clients + reputation online.
* Can take up to a year to make $1000-2000/month or more
* You have to work 40-60 hours starting off, but gets easier as time passes.
* Very unstable source of income.
* Zero experience. Basically starting from scratch.

I know this is something I should decide by myself, but I'd really love to hear your advice and what you'd personally do in my situation."
278,Should I do a summer internship with the Navy research lab or Tesla?,careerguidance,"I have received offers from both and am having a tough time making a decision. For some background I'm a PhD student looking to go back into industry once I'm done. Money isn't super critical to me right now, but would be helpful in paying off some debts. I love the thought of working away from my home state of California, so the thought of DC excites me. However, the pay would just about cover the cost of living there. Does anyone have experience with either of the internships? I'd appreciate some insight. Thanks

NRL:

10 weeks, 11.5k stipend with a security clearance in D.C. 
Project is related to my thesis and would have the possibility of producing a paper.

Tesla: 

~$45/hr in NorCal with relocation package. I have no experience in the ev sector, but it does interest me as a possible future career topic. I am slightly afraid of the long work hours, but if I'm into the work I can see this being a non issue."
279,Which financial advisor direction should I choose?,careerguidance,"So I’m looking into equitable advisors and I heard their training is really good but you have to sell insurance and annuities and stuff to your friends and family to start off with, I also heard they’re not the worst like northwestern but I’m wondering how good and bad they are. Good in terms of how good is their training and bad in terms of am I going to be selling something to my friends and family that won’t truly benefit them in their best interests. I’m currently at a crossroads between choosing to go the slower route by becoming a client service associate at a genuine firm and working my way up slowly and moving to RIA’s or going to equitable for their training and leaving when I am prepared. I’m leaning more towards equitable but if it’s me selling something that won’t truly benefit my friends and family then I don’t wanna potentially ruin their trust with me"
280,Should I take a university job or go back to school to become a teacher?,careerguidance,"I’m 30, unemployed, living with family for the time being and have decent savings. I just got a job offer that I would have jumped at a year ago. It is at a major university in my favorite city, and the pay looks ok (although lower than I’d hope). The job is in higher ed, which I worked in throughout my 20s and feel very ‘meh’ about. So I’m not crazy about the job itself, and I’d have to relocate across the country. But I LOVE this city, especially the neighborhood where the uni is.

I’ve also done a lot of soul searching in my unemployment (lost my job due to covid), and after doing substitute teaching I think I’d like to go back to school to become a special ed teacher. I have the money saved so I wouldn’t go into debt, and I found a great instate program where I’d only take classes for a year. Special Ed teachers are also in demand, and at this point in my life I’d love to be in a field with more stability. However, the program doesn’t start until June. I’m not officially accepted yet either (although it is likely I will be). Getting a teaching degree from the university where I have the job isn’t an option, since they don’t have a program for it.

Any advice? I keep ping ponging between these two and can’t make up my mind!"
281,What would you do in this situation? Should I take the new job or stay?,careerguidance,"I’ve worked in healthcare marketing for a decade, primarily at non-profit organizations. I’ve been with my current company two years and was promoted one year ago. I get along great with my boss and counterpart, but the company’s leadership and even some of the staff I supervise drive me up the wall. I often feel my work isn’t valued and rarely can do things the way I’d want to.

I’ve gotten a job offer at a for-profit company doing their marketing. It would be a substantial pay raise and the role has been described as one where I’d get to build out the marketing department and direction for the company. I’ve met the new boss and he’s quite young and seems laid back. I would not have to initially supervise anyone either as I’d be the only one I’m the department.

I’m pretty torn on whether or not I’m making the right decision to leave. I’ve never worked anywhere longer than 24-26 months and had hoped to stay where I am a bit longer, but due to some of the dysfunction I’ve experienced I started looking. Should I worry about looking like a job hopper? What if the new job turns out to be even worse? Very torn!"

283,My (20F) apprenticeship is draining me because of my manager.. if anyone could take the time to read the below that would be great. I don’t know what it is I’m experiencing. I’ve spoke to my boyfriend and a couple people at my other job. I need some advice.,careerguidance,[removed]
284,Advice for pivoting careers?,careerguidance,"I went to school for design and  am currently working as a designer but honestly do not think I'm good enough for it to be a long term career. I hate my current job and am looking for new opportunities. Are there other career fields I could pivot to with my experience working in design? I just feel so stuck on where to move next. 

Would love to hear if anyone else had a similar experience or pivoted in their career with some success. 

Thanks in advance! 

Tl;dr pivoting away from design as a career"
285,All of my coworkers are leaving my employer- When is it time to move on?,careerguidance,"Hi Reddit! I was hoping to get some advice about possibly moving on in my career (engineering). If I'm on the wrong subreddit, please let me know. 

I work as an engineer for a major automaker. I've been in my role for over 2 years now. Over the past year or so, a huge amount of my team (at least half at this point) has left my employer for another automaker in the area. A number of the people who have left have also told me that they have scored substantial ($20K+) salary increases and get to work on electrified vehicles (EVs), which are quickly becoming the future (for reference, I work on combustion engine products). 

As a result of so many people leaving, I'm taking on more and more work as there are fewer people to do it. I was also given a 3% ""raise"" despite inflation being a concern and many workers leaving for other employers. For reference, I have been at my current job for 2 years, and had one short stint before that (due to personal matters), which is why I'm thinking more cautiously. When it is it appropriate to move on for something better? I don't want to shoot myself in the foot here. 

**TLDR**; Lots of coworkers leaving for higher pay and opportunities to work on what is the future, I'm doing more and more work 2 years in for the same pay as everyone leaves. When should I move on?"
286,Should I let my boss know I’m unhappy 6 months before my contract ends?,careerguidance,"I’m halfway through a 1 year temp to perm contract. I’ve decided I’m not enjoying the job and don’t feel it’s a good fit. My boss however, misses no opportunity to tell me she thinks I’m great. 

My 6 month performance review is coming up. Should I let her know I’m unhappy, with the hope I’ll get to explore other avenues during the rest of my time here? Or just keep my mouth shut, ride out the rest of my contract and leave? 

I guess I’m just worried that if I bring up anything negative, they’ll just fire me, because why keep someone who doesn’t see themselves continuing the role in the future?"
287,Applying for job after job with no response. What can I do to make myself more employable?,careerguidance,"Sorry, I know this will come off ranty. I’m just at a loss and stressing out. 

I started working at my current company in my late teens as a part time frontline worker. Over the next 13 years I transitioned to a full time frontline worker, then a shift lead, then supervisor for my small department and eventually supervisor of a two small departments.

When my location closed my manager transferred me to a new location where I was made a department supervisor with over 20 staff. 

I decided I wanted to move on after about two years of working at my new site. Basically the place is a huge mess and very toxic. I’m also given zero leeway to make any changes or improvements. 

Anyways, I figured having over a decade of loyalty and experience in almost every facet of a company from the frontline to global leadership would make me an asset to a new opportunity. Nope. I have applied for over 100(closer to 200+) jobs and received all of 1 virtual interview request where the interviewer didn’t show up. 

I just don’t get it. People say they’re begging people to work but I’m somehow unemployable. 

Unfortunately I need to stay within the same pay range due to the high cost of living here but even so I’m applying to positions a little above minimum wage but I don’t think that’s unreasonable considering my experience/skill set. 

Should I try lying on my resume to get my foot in the door? 

Would having my resume done professionally help and if so is there a company anyone can suggest? I looked at one before but they wanted hundreds of dollars to do it. 

I feel very trapped and defeated right now. I always thought not being a repeat job hopper and working to learn new skills, take on new challenges/responsibilities, etc would serve me well but I’ve apparently gravely miscalculated and now no one wants to employ me. 

I’m in Ontario Canada if that helps. 

I haven’t gone to college due to financial constraints but I have completed a college course in office computer applications. 

Any advice greatly appreciated!"
288,Am I being impatient?,careerguidance,"So for some context: early 20s male, did a few semesters in college before deciding to stop, currently working at a credit union as a teller and picking up things very quickly but unhappy with the pay. 

I’ve been in this position now for for almost 7 months and although there is certainly room for growth, I’m not sure I’d be making the correct decision to wait for an opening and see if they’d give me a chance at a more desirable role. If I wait another year or however many for a desirable position to open and then not get it, I feel like that would be a waste as I could’ve been looking at opportunities elsewhere. 

Ideally I’d like to get into some type of payroll or budget position (maybe even staff accountant), but I’m worried that I’m being impatient seeing as I’ve been with my current employer for less than a year. I want into a position like this not only so I can start earning a decent livable wage, but also to get out of my current role aspects of customer facing and cross selling. 

My thought process is also that seeing as I’m most likely not going to meet all requirements for employers, that this would be the perfect time to try and hop into a different role considering the staffing shortages and everything going on with the pandemic.

Sorry if this is hard to follow, but I guess it really comes down to am I being impatient or irrational?"
289,"Welp! Got fired on a monday! Yes I hold myself accountable, was it really ethical of them to fire me? How do i proceed from here? Jobs are so hard to find and it takes such a very long time.",careerguidance," 

Welp as the title states.

Late November i quit my FT job (bookkeeping/staff accountant) for a Seasonal Tax season job

reasons were: at my old job, I felt as if I wasnt learning at all and that majority of the job was data entry , but more of a responsibility role rather than actually learning..

Came here and knew the job would be data entry but at the same time I knew i would learn the basics and knowledge of returns, etc...

Anyway fast-foward to today, from the start of December to now, weve been training for 3 days a week on a tax software called ultra tax...

and usally we go by initials on the program when we do our trainings,

for example mine is LA , the other trainee is LS..

there were times where i would click on LS training files. because as a person with ADHD, it helped me understand... to me , i thought it helped me learn and knowing where to actually put in terms of data entry , to them it was cheating...., well when i did get caught by the trainer last week on friday, he asked me, and I sincerely told him that it helped me understand my mistakes, and LS is a smart dude btw so i doubt he was doing things wrong... they said not to do it, and they gave me a warning last friday and i said okay... \*\*edit, i didnt do it again though.. Was just wanred and i knew better not to do it again, so now I didnt do it again.. Was warned on friday the 14th..

the guy that trains us is horrible and cant explain good, as a person with ADHD, i had no other choice but to look at his file for better understandings and for muscle memory, rather than me asking the trainer for ""help"", doesnt even help just says try figuring it out. I had no other choice, but it was way better than me asking the trainee for help in terms of understandings.

Clocked in first thing in the morning, they called me in the conference room, trainer told direcotro of what i was doing and they just decided to fire me...And because of that, they just assumed they werent confident in me, there was nothing for me to argue on my end except for what I said..

proceeded to move on and left immediately.

Just know that an employer doesnt care about the employee, were just a number at the end of the day...

I even got this job through a friend that worked there, and now that it happened, its understood that an employer wont care if their employee recommended this job to me.. &lt;-- thats a reminder to those that feel like taking a that job because their friend recommended it to them and they feel like itll be more secure and safety net. turns out i was wrong..

290,ACES/Poynter Trainings worth it?,careerguidance,"I started my career off as a copy editor, and slowly moved further and further away to the point that I'm now building budgets for clinical trials. I have no idea how I got here, all I know is that I want to go back to editing.

I've been out of the game for about four years now. My skills are rusty and I'm afraid I'll be overlooked for candidates with more recent editing experience. The one thing I have going for me is that my current role is very detail-oriented.

Any editors out there think the ACES Certificate in Editing programs are worth it? They does seem like they'd help me brush up on my skills, but do you think it would actually make me more attractive to employers?"

292,Best way to get into the GIS field with no relevant experience?,careerguidance,"Hello there, I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

I have a bachelor's degree in culinary arts and experience in warehouse management.  I want a career change and have been weighing my options and am unsure which path to pursue.

I'm passionate about environmental and wildlife conservation.  I've applied to a second bachelor's degree program to pursue that course of study, starting in August. However, I know the field is competitive and I'm unsure if it's the right thing to do, even though I'm passionate about it.

I was thinking of specializing in GIS as an alternative.  I know that GIS can be applied towards tons of fields, and if I became skilled in it, I could get a job in conservation using GIS.  My local college doesn't have a GIS undergrad degree - just a minor, a certification, or a master's.  I'm not opposed to taking online courses from another university learn GIS and probably Python, but I don't even know where to begin.

My questions:

* Should I continue down my current path (ecology/conservation biology) and then go for a GIS master's even if would take longer, cost more money, etc?
* Is getting a second bachelor's degree a waste of time even though my first degree is basically worthless?
* If I were to go for a basic GIS certification, what basic knowledge do I need to have going in?  I know Python is useful.  Any specific math or sciences I should have a grasp on?  I basically tested out of all my gen-eds in college, so I haven't taken a math or science class since high school 10+ years ago.

What I value from a career:  hopefully doing more good for the environment than bad, work/life balance, lots of jobs on the market (don't want to have to move just to get a decent job), enough money to live off of, and preferably something where I can work fairly independently instead of babysitting people or being babysat by people

Thanks in advance."

I have an educational background in biochemistry and web development, and I'm wondering what kind of roles I could be suited for? I completed a BSc and postgraduate diploma in biochemistry, and recently finished a web dev bootcamp where I learnt full-stack javascript.

My aim was to get a front, back, or full-stack web dev job, but the competition is so fierce for entry-level roles that I've had to consider other options.

I thought learning a programming language with scientific applications could be useful - maybe something like Python, R or Julia. Thought this would be a neat way to tie biochem and programming together.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other thoughts/suggestions?"
303,money vs balance?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone,

Tl:Dr -would you take a $300 a week pay cut for better appt scheduling during work day and better mentorship? 

Yet another of this type of question. I'm in Ontario Canada if it makes a difference. Mainly asking cause I feel kind of foolish and wanted some advice. I'm a new-ish vet (graduated in May 2020). Thankfully my career saw increased pet ownership over the pandemic. I started in general practice in the GTA making 85k salary in June 2020 (pretty typical expected new grad salary at the time). 9 months later I got a raise to 91k - I'm pretty sure this raise only came about because I mentioned to my boss I was interested in exploring ER on my days off from GP (you know, to develop my skills) but wanted to bring it up with her first. Oh boy did she initially have a problem with that, pretty sure raise was mainly to keep me. Fine I'll take it thanks. Was able to do a few ER shifts a month from June to November and I kind of liked it, it was challenging and I was (and still am) getting good mentorship from the ER owner who is lovely. 

In November I decided to try my hand at being an independent contractor. My boss was upset but I softened the blow by offering to stay 2 days a week and one Saturday a month. So since November I've been working Mondays ER (and the occasional Tuesday or Saturday night) and Thursday/Fridays GP with a Saturday every month. 

Because I'm still learning ER it's about $60 an hour (which is low for ER in the area but I traded that for good mentorship, plus I don't see doing ER long term, it just works for my present housing and life situation). I make $65 an hour GP for a 10 hour day. All in I made $114k last year (most of it from salary, just under $30k self employed. For some reference, the other vet in the GP practice who has 10 years experience on me and has been with the clinic for 3 years only just got his first raise from $95k to $120k a few months ago. He was told he didn't get a raise the previous year because he wasn't generating enough income (I guarantee you he was as new puppies and kittens skyrocketed!).

Anyway, i've known from the start that this GP clinic is not my forever clinic. And the more I've worked there the more I disagree with the management style and I don't think the owner is a very good manager. I'm close with 2 girls (a vet tech and a receptionist) at work so we talk a lot. Vet tech has been beating her head against the wall trying to tell owner things that need attending to within the clinic or interpersonal problems and it either gets ignored or somehow gets turned back around on her.  So I don't even try to tell owner things unless specifically asked because it just feels like a futile effort from previous observations. There's also 2 clinics (10 minutes apart but technically in different cities) so I occasionally get moved from 1 to the other which fine if slightly irritating. The girls have told me the other vet in the clinic constantly tries to punt clients to where I am because ""I make more money than him"" (even though he's perfectly capable of seeing them and the clients rightfully want to go to their home clinic not drive 10-15 minutes out of their way). And I'm just getting tired of the way the appointment book is organized (i.e it's not) - constantly feeling pressure to rush through surgeries to see more appts, 20 minute appts 9am-6:40pm, no lunch break just eat if you get a break between appts and there's 3x20 minute block off periods on the calendar through the day but they frequently get booked over. I'm also alone in GP clinic so I felt my learning was stagnating, hence the desire to try ER.

I recently had a GP job offer kind of fall in my lap through family connections. I went to check out the place and it was so different from what I'm used to! The day starts 8:30/9am, ends at 6pm and there's 2 hours from 12-2 shut down (1 hour for lunch and 1 hour for catch up time). Appts are 30 minutes, it's one location, there's always another vet or 2 around except on Saturdays, you get a whole morning for surgery and don't have to see appts until 2pm. And if you're done earlier than 6pm, you just get to go home rather than wait out the clock. They seem really focused on work life balance and have said they'll mentor me in those things I don't know how to do yet (mainly surgeries and dental procedures). I did accept the job with them for a flat $500 a day. I don't think I'm regretting my decision per se as that $500 includes 2 hours of paid ""me time"" during the day and good mentorship, which I can't say I'm getting at my current GP clinic, and the culture just seems way less toxic overall. But I can't deny that little voice that says ""hello, you're taking a $300 a week paycut?"" External thoughts on the matter would be appreciated! "
304,Where do I go...what do I do? Just looking for a little advice.,careerguidance,"Firstly I would like to apologise if this gets a bit lengthy, I tend to word vomit whilst typing what I am thinking.

I am an Engineer living in the UK. I didnt do great in my educational life, but I did however graduate from university with a foundation degree in engineering before life filled up and I ended my education. 
When I finished my degree, the recession hit and I was left just looking at the same jobs I had to get myself through university. 
My first ""engineering"" job was for a popular satellite company, I continued with them for the past 5 years and found that there was barely any recognition and no further progression through the business, that combined with a toxic work environment culminated in me leaving the company in November last year. 
I have since moved into further employment servicing fire alarm systems and I feel like I have made a wrong choice. I have struggled for most of my adult life to get my CV recognised and for any company that I have applied for to even send a rejection, let alone any hope of being given even a sniff of an interview. 

But where do I go from here, I don't want to leave my current job as it is still putting food on the table etc, but I feel like I'm gonna damage my mental health staying there for too long. 
Has anyone any experience with CV writing companies? As this is something I have been looking into recently. Does anyone have any pointers, any engineers out there who have struggled like I have but have found the glimmering light? 

Feel free to ask me any questions if you want any more information. Any advice would be helpful."

My coworkers have thousands of connections. And I was also told that I cannot use the anonymous mode. I deal with a massive amount of anxiety and paranoia from past life events, and having my name out there for that many people to see makes me extremely nervous. However all of these things are vital parts of my job. They’re pretty much my entire job. It’s not just that either. I’m reaching out to these people to sell them something. I’m sure that’s pretty irritating for many of them. I feel like I’m almost burning bridges if that makes sense. Not that I’ll ever meet any of them, but you just never know.

322,What is the minimal amount of time to stay in a company before switching?,careerguidance,"I just finished an interview and the interviewer(HR) made a remark about how I switch company too often and it's a bad reflection of my work ethics. I thought that the number of years I stayed was good so I was a bit shocked. Additionally, most of the time I switch to a new job because of a promotion(title &amp; money).

1st job: 1 year and 10 months

3rd job: 2 years and 4 months

4th job(promotion): 3 years and 8 months

323,"I'm so unhappy, but I'm not sure which direction I want my career to go. Considering a full transition, it is difficult to decide what is best for me. What am I missing?",careerguidance,"I am considering a major career transition that includes going back to school/bootcamp/certification, but I'm simply at a loss at what is best for me, or if I will be happy if I make the change.

I'm 33 years old, turning 34 in less than 6 months. I graduated from undergrad in 2011, immediately began working in public affairs / communications, adding a bit of marketing to my work as I moved jobs. I earned my Masters in Public Administration &amp; Public Policy while working (2014), which led to a better job in a major tourism marketing organization. Eventually, I left that role to lead a small regional tourism marketing organization (Executive Director) for two years before COVID derailed the industry. I began working as the Director of Communications at a non-profit back in May. The past few years - even during my stint as ED for the tourism organization, I've felt just immeasurably unfulfilled. In high school, I imagined getting into politics, leading to my initial job in government affairs. Everything about it felt boring, and it felt like everything I did made zero impact. I moved to a different role with more responsibilities in an industry I liked (tourism), the role itself felt very ""busy-work"" ish, which led me to take on some marketing responsibilities, which I enjoyed, and led to my ED role. 

Ultimately, I don't feel like that work was fulfilling, and my work now is just mentally draining. I'm an excellent writer, and while that skill has certainly been a major factor in landing all previous jobs, I've realized that being in the public affairs / comms side is a combination of stressful, boring, and unfulfilling. There are other reasons I am unhappy in my current role, but I believe that the career path ahead of me won't fix any of these issues.

For the past year or so, I've seriously considered going ""all in"" and making a major career transition into a more technical field. I've looked into various coding bootcamps and university courses, and they excite me. I've always LOVED working with computers, though I've never taken any coding courses. I used to do IT support as a college student (as a university employee), I've built several desktops, etc. While I don't want to do IT support as a career, I enjoyed it because it felt more like a hobby than a job. I feel like I can get that same feeling with a more tech-focused career.

**This is where I am struggling.** I simply don't know what I want to do. I see positives and negatives for the different career tracks (full stack development, software engineer, network security, etc). Is there something that can combine a coding language/s with marketing? Is that even what I want (and that's for me to figure out, I know)? I am 100% ok taking a year away from a salary to focus and earn a certification or degree or whatever it may be. I just don't know what I should focus on. Given my age, this is a big decision, and I don't want to focus on something that ultimately doesn't give me what I want. 

**What do I ultimately want?** When I started my career, I felt I wanted to grow into a high-level position in a major public-facing organization (CEO, CCO, President, etc). While I still would *like* that, I'm more interested in building a career that can sustain me for the rest of my working life, pays really well, and allows me to retire comfortably (ideally young, at that). I currently earn in the $120k ballpark and am open to a salary cut if it means transitioning into something with long-term gains.  


What should I be considering? What is missing from my thought process? I feel so torn and so lost that it's become hard for me to thoroughly articulate (or even decide) what my goals are."

**Anyone else experiencing something similar? Advice? If you've gone through this, how did you stay engaged and satisfied in your career when stuck in stasis?** 

Little more info below: 

Even if they don't have 10 - 20 years more experience in the industry, successful candidates tend to have more management experience (and certainly more overall career experience) and that puts them in front every time.  Even when I've had a network connection and great interviews, I've been either offered a lower level position equivalent to my current one or told that I need more extensive management experience (which I don't know how to get if I can't get hired for jobs that offer it!). 

It seems like I have a two options:

Make a lateral move (similar salary and responsibility and likely worse benefits/commute/flexibility) to a different employer in the hope that they'll have management more supportive of career advancement and room for growth internally. 

Bide my time at my current employer, keep networking and applying, and focus on other stuff in my life."

333,"Want to join military but in second year of university doing a course I have no interest in, what should I do?",careerguidance,"So to give context, I'm in my second year of university doing an engineering degree. I'm doing this course essentially because I didn't know what else to do. I've known for quite a few years that I wanted to join the Royal Marines or failing that the army, but I've been working on my fitness however there have been complications and set backs due to covid so it's taking longer than expected to get to the required fitness standard. 

So essentially I am in this position where I am convinced if I continue to train hard, consistently and follow my training plan, I'll be ready to join by September of this year or by 2023 at the latest. My interest in this course has hit rock bottom and I am definitely going to fail the semester exams coming up in a few days but I just don't really care. I feel a little anxious but only because I don't want to disappoint anyone else.

So to lay it all out, I'm not going to be ready to join the branch of the military I want to until the end of this year but I've lost interest in my course completely. The only reason I really go to lectures/tutorials is because I wouldn't be doing anything else otherwise and to keep my professors off my back. I know the sensible thing to do is just grit my teeth and power through because a degree will always be useful and later in life but I think I'm too far behind at this point to make it worth while.

I honestly don't know what to do.

Option A: Do I just take a complete L on these exams, resit them later in the summer, try to catch up with all my work to salvage my degree and tell my professors exactly what happened and my situation. Still continue to train hard for the marines but just join after my degree? 

That seems like the smart choice but I also think my final year will be alot harder and there's no guarantee I'll be able to stick with it if I already don't give a shit now.

Option B: do I come clean to my professors that my heart really isn't in it and I'm just killing time until I can do what I actually want to do? That seems like an appealing option but I'm not sure if they would make me drop out of uni or let me just enjoy the good aspects of uni until the end of this academic year.

Option C: Just do what I've been doing so far, go to mandatory university things like labs and lectures and try to bullshit my way through everything else until I eventually fail this year and am forced to drop out. Not very appealing since I feel like I'm being disingenuous to my family and professors.

Also ideally I need to making a decision soon since living arrangements need to be made for next academic year (September) if I do power through my degree so I can't even just see how it goes and make my mind up later.

I'm not really sure what advice I'm looking for since if my friend asked me what option he should go for I would probably say option A. But option A doesn't seem very appealing. But give me your best shot.

Two or so years ago I attempted nursing school and failed. I was one semester away from graduating and they wouldn't readmit me.

I think cyber forensics would be super interesting, but I'm not interested in work at a bank or the IRS. I'd like to do more serious crimes; but at least where I'm at, you have to have already been a detective or sworn in officer for the bigger stuff. I've dipped my toes in every pond.

I've cleaned hoarded houses and biohazardous materials and that was pretty fun actually, but there isn't a ton of demand in my city unfortunately. I love the *idea* of forensics but I'm terrible with science and the demand unfortunately isn't that high. I'm a great writer, always done stellar on my papers. I know this is all over the place, but so is my head.  I love healthcare, forensics, and I really don't even mind manual labor. I just can't seem to commit to any one field. I am in therapy and we touch on it here and there, but it's driving me crazy. Not to mention when all you have on your resume is your decade of ass wiping, who's gonna want you?

339,Any suggestions? :(,careerguidance,"These are my lifetime goals:
1. Financial Freedom (Not doing things just for money and having the time to do the things that I want to do and that also includes taking care of myself more)
2. Living in a first world country in a big city near the beach (I'm from an island so i must have beaches near me wherever I go)
3. Find a partner with similar goals as mine (someone from a different country/culture preferably)
4. Be able to travel occasionally to different places (visit different countries at least 2 times a year and also visit my family 3 times every year)
5. Getting recognized in the film industry


I know I sound like a lunatic with these goals... im just a 24 year old gay virgin working as a Data Analyst in a bank with only 2 years of experience and a bachelor degree in Business Management getting paid 1k a month (i only can save/invest about 200 a month, i only have saved 20k) and I'm still living with my mom🤷‍♂️ i have no idea how the hell im gonna get there.

 I could start applying for scholarships to get a master's degree in Data Science (which I hate but that's the only STEM field I'm lowkey competitive for given my experience), but the scholarships available in my country force you to return to your homecountry for another 2 years after finishing the degree.  During my years of studying I'll focus on my studies (and maybe take advantage of my last remaining years of my 20s and do fun activities on the side while I'm there) after  completing the master's I'll be 28. then I'll return to my country and spend another 2 years cause that's part of the scholarship's contract. During those 2 years I'll start to focus on where I want to live, building up a resume, and deal with all of the paperwork and residency stuff, while also applying for remote jobs abroad. After those 2 years I'll be 30, hopefully ready to leave my country and find a decent paying permanent job in a first world country big city near a beach. 

I know I will despise the job regardless because of the field I had to choose to get a decent job in a country that allows me to build more money.. if I do that then I'll  be a step closer to achieve my dreams, (I can check off the ""living in a first  world country"" goal by then)and after working for a year or 2 I wanna be able to quit and produce money myself. By then I'll be 32. Then I'll spend 3 years building a passive income system. And hopefully by 35 ill be able to be financially free. Then I'll start traveling more, doing things like film-related stuff and looking for a partner. I wish I could find another way of doing this cause this process seems daunting and I dont know if I'll be able to survive while doing so (I deal with lots of depression and anxiety toy and I saabotage myself when I do things I despise but I can't conform to living this way forever cause that also will make me kill myself I'm a in a limbo i think) oh well money does buy happiness I guess. What would you do in my position? There should be something, a different route ;( maybe I'm to lazy to live :( or I'm scared of sacrifice and pain because of my experience with it in the past... maybe my 100% is not compatible with achieving these goals or amounting to anything maybe some people belong to death or living in the streets... but Idk I remember in college I had to study SOOOO HARD (even when I was in the toilet cause I struggled to learn things and so I had to memorize them EVERY MINUTE if I wanted to do well and earn a 3.9GPA when I graduated college, I did achieve that tho)... but ugh life is like college or highschool, but worse, I dont know why I always have to pick a hardcore path and I never find an easier one. Maybe I'm too lazy for existence, too lazy to deserve nice things."

347,How do I tell my micromanaging boss that I’m leaving?,careerguidance,"This is a bit of a long story, apologies! I have a tldr at the end.

I (23F) started my current job at the beginning of August—so it’s been about 5 months. I quickly realized that the woman I report to has issues with control and trust, and I find that she’s tried to micromanage me on multiple occasions. 

I’m technically a remote employee, but she’s constantly asking where I’m working from—I tried to understand why, but it’s started to annoy me lately. She starts every one of our checkins with “so are you working from your apartment right now?” Sometimes I’ll work from my fiancé’s or my parents if I’m visiting, or I’ll choose to sit at a coffee shop simply for a change of scenery. Where I work from, in my opinion, doesn’t change my performance. Something that really set me off recently happened around Christmas time, where I spent the first half of the week at my fiancés (and she knew because she has a literal seizure if I don’t tell her) and then planned to work from his apartment again the following Monday, after Christmas. Seeing this, she asked me, “so when are you going to see your parents then?” And I didn’t feel that I needed to answer her at first, because it’s none of her business, but I told her I would go see them on Saturday, because we don’t celebrate Christmas anyway—so it didn’t matter when I went. She also stalks my calendar—I unshared it with her for literally 10 minutes and she immediately messaged me asking why.

I started to feel frustrated because it was obvious that she didn’t trust me and she even admitted that she micromanages and is controlling (in terms of her planning for her wedding), and it was beginning to feel like a very toxic environment for me. So I started to look for other jobs.

Last week, I was offered a position with a Fortune 500 company, almost a $40k salary boost from what I make now. I accepted the offer, but I’m struggling on how to tell my manager because I know she’s going to ask me when I had the time to attend interviews and such. I had them all after work hours but I don’t feel like explaining this to her. I also have my annual review next week. 

I need to tell her by the end of this month but I’m very nervous. How should I approach her?

tldr; my manager tries to be my mom and is always checking up on where I am/what I’m doing, etc. I got a new job and don’t know how to tell her I’m quitting, because I know she will ask me a million different questions questions on when I had my interviews and will not believe me when I say they were after work hours."

350,New Job Requires Travel - Concerns?,careerguidance,"Hola,

So I just accepted a new IT position right before the new year with a 35% increase in pay.  I spoke with the hiring manager, and they mentioned about a 10 - 20% travel rate, which seemed fine for me.  This morning I got connected with someone that I am going to be working with and they were able to give me more insight into the travel.

So basically, they said that travel varies.  Sometimes it can be multiple times a month, once a month, or even every other month.  Our work days are only Monday - Thursday, so we would fly out Monday and fly back Thursday.  He also said that if not always, you will be home for the weekends (Friday - Sunday).

This is my first job that has a travel aspect, and I have a baby boy coming in May.  I talked with the Wife and she seems to be ok with this, and happy for me making great moves in my career.  If we weren't having a baby right now, I would have no reservations about this, but since we are, I just don't know how I feel about it.

Those that do travel, how do you see it affecting your at home life, if at all?  Have you noticed that a little time away from each other has helped your relationship (we both work from home right now and we tend to get a little agitated easier since we never get time apart)."

353,How do I tell my manager that I want to cancel our 1 on 1?,careerguidance,"Based in the US

Background: My manager is my direct manager’s boss. She used to be my direct manager in the last role. After she got promoted to be the current job, she got me a promotion which is my current job. She thought i was a high performer, which was not true. I was working 80 hour weeks (no pay for overtime) and had trouble saying no. 

My company was going through some lay offs, so I asked this manager last summer to have monthly 1 on 1s, so I could let her know that I’m doing a good job and have regular career opportunity discussions. Around December, it became clear that that I won’t have a long term career at this company, so I’m starting to use any time that I’m not actively working on my day job to look for a new job.

I want to stop having the 1 on 1s with the manager because 1) i no longer want career advancement in the same company 2) she always ask if I’d like to take on extra projects because she thought I’m high capacity. I don’t want to do extra projects because I need all the time I have to apply, network, and prep for interviews. My direct manager thinks I’m doing a good enough job (not ground breaking, but also good enough to be average).

I canceled my meeting with the manager last month because of holidays. I’m not particularly busy so I can’t use it as an excuse. What should I tell her that I don’t want to meet with her anymore?

For the time being, I just plan to make myself seem as busy as possible one month at a time so hopefully she doesn’t give me more work. Also considering just canceling the meeting series without explanation. The manager will notice because she’s extremely detail oriented but she’s probably gonna be too busy to confront me about it…"

I have my BFA in Design (2015) , and MA in Design Business Management (2018). I have some experience doing administrative work, as I was a T.A in Grad School and I do a lot of the administrative work at my own company. 

Ideally, I would like to find a 9-5 job that isn’t super complicated, with a bit of downtime involved so I can multitask. When speaking with employers, should I tell them I am also working on my own business? Also, I have always done more ‘creative’ jobs.

359,"A new job I am interviewing for, requires the contact information for 3 references who currently work with me, including my manager and 2 other colleagues. How should go about asking each to be my reference?",careerguidance,"Hi all,

First and foremost, let me start out by saying that I have an incredible relationship with my current employer, and a very strong relationship with my current manager and colleagues.

I have been at this job since December 2020, and it is my first job that has started my career. My field is Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Now, while I probably could have not have found a better company to work for as a way to begin my career, there are a couple of logistic reasons on why I have been applying elsewhere.

My current employer hired me in the middle of the pandemic, and so I have been working from home since. However, in December 2021 they came out with a return to office policy. I have no problems working in the office, my issue is that I currently live 1.5 hours away (1.5 hour commute each way), and the commute is brutal. I've had open discussions with my manager about how this commute is affecting me, but also that they are not paying me enough to even afford moving to the city where they are located. At the end of December 2021, I received a 12% raise but that still isn't enough.

This new opportunity that I am interviewing for is quite rare. I live in a small town that never has any GIS jobs. My local municipality put out an ad for one however, and I immediately applied. I have always wanted to work in my own community and this opportunity is perfect. It's a government position, local, suits me well, and higher pay.

I am having issues trying to figure out how I can ask my current manager and 2 other colleagues in my current company to be a reference for me. How can I go about this? Should I write it in an email or have a video call with them? What should I say?

I am going to be as open, honest, and transparent with them (as I always am), but I've never had to do this before, and I am no idea on how to handle the situation.

Thanks in advance!"

I graduated back in 2018 with a double major in econ and environmental policy and worked in an extremely toxic work environment in the non-profit sector for 3 years. I just moved to an agency as it looked like I was going to be pushed out of my old job but I just don't think I can keep up with the expectations of agency work and I and working from 9-8pm to keep up with the work load. Plus I don't have the power that I did at my old job to set my own boundaries regarding time worked.

I'm trying to carve out time to learn Python and SQL so I can switch industries but juggling this job and trying to expand my skills feels near impossible.

361,Help/advice with pay negotiation?,careerguidance," I am looking for some advice or help on how to handle this situation! I have been with my company going on 3 years now and I've been in a sales role now for over 2 of those years. My current team has the highest base sales salary in the company but a lower commission % because of it (which is ok by me, more stable pay). I was chosen to move over to a new team that is basically a start-up position, they have no operating system yet and we are basically building a new department in the company from the bottom up. For this, they are offering a ""pay guarantee"" since there's no guarantee we will even be making sales or getting this off the ground for months. This pay guarantee is $5/hr less than my current base, and the monthly commissions is an average of our last 24 month commissions. Which would be fine, if my commissions hadn't taken a $40k hit last year due to the pandemic. So my guarantee would actually end up being less than I currently make.

367,Quitting new job after 2 months to go back to old job?,careerguidance,"Hello!

In desperate need of advice.

I quit my old job (which I loved) at the end of my maternity leave because we moved and my commute was 90 minutes one way. I did the commute while pregnant and I was exhausted. I worked only 3 days a week- 12 hour shifts- but in a large city and the cost (about $300 a month for train and/or parking) and time of commuting felt too overwhelming once the baby came. I took a new job 40 minutes from home with a significant pay cut (about 40k) but felt it was worth it to be home with my baby more. Plus, I would be saving money on commuting.

I've been in my new job for 2 months and hate it. I feel I need to prove myself again and I don't find the people to be warm or welcoming, to put it mildly. I previously had amazing relationships with my coworkers and felt respected. Not to mention I was comfortable there- I was there for 7 years. I am now anxious on my days off thinking about the next day I have to go in. I have also since found out more about the new job- the weekend shift requirement is more, other benefits are not as good- health insurance, time off, maternity leave, etc. And I likely won't get any vacation time in the summer for several YEARS due to my lack of seniority. 

I've already talked to my old manager who has said I would be welcomed back with open arms and I am seriously considering it. I would also retain my seniority at my old job if I return in a certain time period (have to decide within a few months). I am telling myself plenty of people do long commutes even 5 days a week and I only work 3. The thought of potentially telling my new job that I am leaving so soon is terrifying to me (people pleaser). I also fear I am looking back at the old job/commute with rose colored glasses given I am so unhappy in my current position. If this weren't a time sensitive issue I would give it more time to see if I can adjust where I currently am- but I don't have the luxury if I want to retain my seniority (meaning less weekends, nights, priority in choosing vacation time).

377,How to fix a burnout?,careerguidance,"TL;DR ""I (23F) am currently 2 weeks away from starting working at a new company. My old company has drained me from all my motivation to work and I have been on a huge burnout for the past few months, which is why I decided to quit. How do I ensure that that burnout won't affect my new job as well?""  


And for those of you that need some more info. I have been working in my current company for more than a year. I started working there as part of a three month internship for my Uni, and they decided to keep me full-time. The three month internship was ok-ish, learnt some stuff etc, and because I still had to write my Master Thesis, and I thought that it would look good on my CV to have some work experience in my field (Machine Learning Engineering) before finishing my studies, I decided to agree to the offer.   
The pay wasn't great but as I was still a student, living with my mom, i didn't really think much of it, as long as I had projects to do, and could learn more stuff, which I thought I had. Ohh how the turntables.... The moment I started working there full-time, my Senior left the company. As the months progressed I realized that the company had zero vision on ML, I didn't have stuff to do unless I suggested some nice features on projects I was on, the rest of the Data Science Team was excluding both me and my project partner from the DS Team (they are doing mostly Data Analysis etc while we were more into Deep Learning etc), which didn't help at all considering both me and her were new to the company, started working there remotely, and had no prior work experience (she was a Phd grad and started working at the company few days before me). So we both were very alienated and decided to search for a new job.

She was luckier than I was since she had a Phd and in that field it is a huge plus, and unfortunately there are not many Junior job openings in that field in my country. So she left first, which meant I was all alone. As my burnout was getting bigger and bigger I finally landed a huge opportunity for me, working as a Researcher in a company with a clear vision etc. 

Which brings us to today. I am currently 2 weeks away from starting working at the new company. Right now my burnout from my current position is humongous. To the point I can barely get focused for more than 30 minutes, which is rare for me considering I was always the person to work my a\*\* off to do the best possible job I could, without procrastinating. I am scared that the burnout will affect me at my new position, especially because I will keep working remotely for the first few months (the company is currently renovating the offices and till they are done I will have to work from home).   


Is there a way to just relax my mind, and get rid of the burnout somehow because it's really affecting me mentally and I really don't want to screw up the new job, since it is a position I am so excited for."

380,"Offered a new position with higher salary, how to ask for a raise at my current job?",careerguidance,"I was offered a position in supply chain with a higher salary, $60,000 base with a $5400 possible bonus and annual reviews. The downside is the job is an hour commute one way, and salary (I am current hourly). I am about 3 minutes from the office right now, that’s hard to give up. I don’t really want to live in the city the position is located, and it’s super expensive anyway. 

I currently make $48,000. I’ve been here for almost 6 years and until this position never got a real raise. 

How do I ask for a raise without saying “I’ve got another job offer”? 

- I’ve considered asking if this department does yearly reviews, or if they plan on giving a COL raise since everything has gone up so much. 

I need to let the new employer know by today and I’m not sure what to do. I value my free time, and taking the new job would take up at least another 15 hours per week. I’m not sure if it’s worth it."
381,Am I right to feel completely disrespected by my raise? (3.5%),careerguidance,"Without making this an essay, pretty much I do sales for a biotech company. I’m American, and I work at an Asian company. When I first joined,
I asked for this company to match my American salary, which is well higher than the local average here. Because of that, I’ve been swamped with work, handling multiple distributors, and taking on multiple side projects. All while some of my team members aren’t doing jack shit. Yes, they get paid significantly lower than me, but it still makes me angry how they got 5+% raises, all while I got a 3.5%. They actually denied my request for a 4% raise saying my salary is too high. My company isn’t doing too well in terms of sales, and we’ve been going negative the past couple of years. However from my perspective: I should still get my raise due to the fact that I do exponentially more work than everyone else. Am I wrong to think I should’ve gotten a higher raise?"
382,Dropping out?,careerguidance,"I'm from Norway and I'm currently on my masters degree for IT and have a bachelor degree in Computer Science. I never wanted to study this. Always been interested in storytelling - directing and writing. Been forced to study this by my parents and I understand their thinking. Meaning that the future of technology implies manifold opportunities and securing a guaranteed position. The only thing that is driving me to continue studying it, is to please my parents. I don't want this to be my purpose. I don't love it and I'm nowhere near passionate about it. I couldn't see myself sitting in an office and spending hours devoted to this, even though I'd give me financial stability.  


Regarding directing and writing, I've been doing this since very young. I've produced work, and have them be accepted at festivals, that received many positive feedback and telling me ""you should pursue this"" and ""you should definitely apply to this school for this"". Although I'm aware this career path is uncertain. Some people achieve it, some vaguely. I am very passionate about this and I'd commit and put whatever hard work to achieve it. Always brings me joy whenever I think about it. Even if it means I'll have to work in a coffee shop on the side, I'd do it.

This course is throughout 3 days but 6 classes, and the end of the course they give you a certificate.  I'm wondering if it's worth paying the 1000$ for this course, mostly not for the vast experience and learning but for the University of Oxford certificate. I feel like this would greatly enhance my portfolio and allow me to go higher as a cyber security career. Does anyone know if this is worth it?"
384,What should I do? Thinking of quitting my job.,careerguidance,"So my company was recently bought out by a large bank.

In order to give the employees something to strive for, the former had implemented a system of levels, each with their own pay band for all positions. They did this because people were complaining that once they were in a role, they felt stuck with no way to progress.

I performed particularly well this year and was expecting a bump to the next level (with a substantial increase in salary).

I did get bumped to the next level at my review, but they told me that the new company decided they no longer consider level bumps as actual promotions so they did away with the salary bands. Bear in mind this flies in the face of there being levels in the first place. So I got a nominal performance increase (substantially less than I was expecting), but now I have extra responsibility.

Mind you the people who got bumped last year go to benefit from the extra pay.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm well compensated, but there is now a clear double standard and I know some ppl get paid far more for doing the exact same job.

Now this change impacted a number of people, so a fully expect a number of them to leave once they get their bonuses. I'm debating this as well.

I would have much trouble finding a similar position, but overall I would probably need to take a slight pay cut.

Do I just grin and bear it? I feel like I've been cheated as none of these changes were communicated be the review. In the current climate, I'm torn because I know so many people are struggling, but I can never trust my employer again.

What should I do? This is not the first time I feel I've been mistreated. This is starting to feel like an abusive relationship. There is no more trust."
385,Should I bring up raise/promotion before the 1 year mark?,careerguidance,"Hi all, I work as a talent manager for a localization company. I'm 24, I was hired as a paid intern out of my relevant MA degree for £18k (I live in London) in February of last year. In September I was taken on full time for £26k. As a first job, from home and honestly fairly low stress that seemed fair to me.

Now, since then I have honestly taken on and, to an extent, been required to take on, much more than my role entails. My colleague in the same position does much less than me (and I'm starting to think she's onto something). This has been noticed by my old manager, my current manager, and pretty much every other high level person I've interacted with. I'm constantly going above and beyond and it is certainly noticed. However, considering I'm taking on the responsibilities of a strategist more than a talent manager, my current pay and position are starting to feel too tight.

I'm not very assertive in these situations, but my boyfriend is encouraging me to bring up the matter of promotion or raise before the 1 year mark. I don't know how to feel about it as the situation gives me a lot of anxiety. At the same time it's just not me to do less knowing I could do more, if that makes sense.

391,"Need help deciding my next career move: fully remote with a better technical challenge, or local with an easier one?",careerguidance,"Hey all, I'm facing a tough decision.

I'm currently a senior engineer at an awesome company with an office in London. But, the work is easy and it's almost impossible to find a decent challenge. Perhaps if I switch teams but I've only found one team doing something interesting and they don't have the headcount now.  


So, long story short I have an offer from 2 startups for a founding engineer role. The salary is higher, but if I take into account the options I'm now vesting every month (since I've already worked here &gt;1 year) it's kind of the same at the current value. But these startups have high growth potential, so when the options begin to vest after the 1st year it should be worth it.

Downside: the startup I prefer is in California so I'd be working fully remote. I have never worked fully remote so no idea if it'll be lonely/boring/very hard

The other startup offers similar salary and equity, but is based in London - although it's less interesting from a technical point of view (the other one does ML, which I'm really into)

TL;DR + numbers

Current: 87.5k salary + vesting \~5k in options/month

California startup: 130k + 500k options (still negotiating though, might end up a bit lower)  
London startup: 120-140k + 500k options (same, negotiating)

(I believe both startups have good changes of success based on their product and founding team)

\-------

Bottom line is: remote but great technical challenge and probably great learning opportunity outside of my current skillset, or local but on the same skillset I already have

I'm leaning towards the california option, for the growth in skills mainly"

394,Do all 6+figure jobs require large personal sacrifice?,careerguidance,"Hey fam, my current role is destroying my mental and physical health, i don't know if the grass is greener in another role of same pay grade or its basically all health sacrifice once you start going into 6+figure territory, could use some advice.

Background:

I've been working in Medical Device sales for 3 years. Pay is $110k base + uncapped commission + bonus, OTE $170k+. The pressure, stress and responsibility is enormous. I travel constantly.

First year I went all out, worked basically 7 days a week, because I had to prove myself. I basically burnt out, had all the symptoms, physically and mentally, thought I was dying (I basically was) and my doctor told me I had to quit my job if I wanted my health problems to go away.

I pushed through. I needed the money, and my pride wouldn't allow me to quit. I did well, got promoted, made good money. 2020 hit and lock down saved my health because I could stay at home and do jack all and recover.

Now things are back to normal, how I cope with the job is to become emotionally detached from it. Every day I work with the mindset that I'm willing to quit and walk away, but this affects my performance because I wasn't burning myself to perform well.

I'm not sure if other 6 figure jobs ($120k+) require the same amount of sacrifice to perform well in because this is my first 6 figure job. Is it worthwhile to look elsewhere or should I just stick it through my current job because the grass isn't greener?"

For a long time I had thought I wanted to be a clinical psychologist, but after the pandemic I realized that I don’t immediately want to go to graduate school. I love my major and I’m happy that I studied it, but I don’t know what to do with it in terms of getting a job. My parents keep telling me that I need to have a job after I graduate, but with no research experience and little work experience (working a campus job) it’s hard for me to think of jobs that require one or the other. I thought about going into HR, but some of the jobs descriptions that I’ve seen say that I need at least 1-3 years of working in it and they are entry level jobs.

1) I can stay in the military, deal with the bs and retire out. I’ll have a pension and healthcare though I don’t think I’ll get that fulfillment I’m looking for in making a difference in people’s lives.

2) I’m very interested in international relations/diplomacy so I can make my way to the State Department. Really would like foreign service but with family civil may have to do. Only issue is I’m not sure how much good I can do with what I believe is the current state of US diplomacy.

3) go non-profit route and directly help people in need/make a difference in the short term. I can help others and see that there’s an immediate impact, but that’s usually not a permanent solution. Also probably wouldn’t get paid much.

4) run for some sort of political office to make a difference in peoples lives in the long term. In a perfect world, passing bills/rules/laws that can lead to positive benefits, turn people’s lives around for the better and provide permanent solutions for problems. Of course bureaucracy is a pain, politics is messy, bipartisanship is dead and too many lawmakers just wants likes on social media or payment from huge companies.

402,"Ontario, Canada: a new job I am interviewing for requires the contact information for 3 references who currently work with me, including my manager and 2 other colleagues. How should I go about asking each to be my reference?",careerguidance,"Hi all,

First and foremost, let me start out by saying that I have an incredible relationship with my current employer, and a very strong relationship with my current manager and colleagues.

I have been at this job since December 2020, and it is my first job that has started my career. My field is Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Now, while I probably could have not have found a better company to work for as a way to begin my career, there are a couple of logistic reasons on why I have been applying elsewhere.

My current employer hired me in the middle of the pandemic, and so I have been working from home since. However, in December 2021 they came out with a return to office policy. I have no problems working in the office, my issue is that I currently live 1.5 hours away (1.5 hour commute each way), and the commute is brutal. I've had open discussions with my manager about how this commute is affecting me, but also that they are not paying me enough to even afford moving to the city where they are located. At the end of December 2021, I received a 12% raise but that still isn't enough.

This new opportunity that I am interviewing for is quite rare. I live in a small town that never has any GIS jobs. My local municipality put out an ad for one however, and I immediately applied. I have always wanted to work in my own community and this opportunity is perfect. It's a government position, local, suits me well, and higher pay.

I am having issues trying to figure out how I can ask my current manager and 2 other colleagues in my current company to be a reference for me. How can I go about this? Should I write it in an email or have a video call with them? What should I say?

I am going to be as open, honest, and transparent with them (as I always am), but I've never had to do this before, and I am no idea on how to handle the situation.

Thanks in advance!"

409,"What are some small, medium or large cities with a tech presence and good career opportunities?",careerguidance,"***TL;DR at the bottom!*** 

I live Norther California and work in tech, so I know plenty about the Silicon Valley and other major tech hubs in the US. However, I'm looking to move to a new city/state (not in the Bay Area) sometime in the second half of 2022 and I'm starting to research on where that place may me. I'm a 28 year old male, fwiw

I'm single, no kids, have a good career path (still entry level), money in the bank, and nothing lying me down, so pretty much any place is open. 

I'm trying to figure out a good city to move to -  whether that be for a year and move to a new city or 5 years and meet a girl and fall in live - so I've been researching on LinkedIn and Indeed and it feels as though the abundance of jobs are there, which will give me a good idea on if I can live in said location for an unspecified amount of time while I'm looking for a job (i.e. move there and live in a long term Airbnb for a month while I apply to positions and then find a permanent place to live. 

I work in tech, but on the operations/HR side of it. I'm a technical recruiter/sourcer and would like to stay in the field and move up in the HR latter. Ideally, at my next position, I would like to to work for a consumer-facing tech company - i.e. a company that sells a product to a consumer like software/videogames for consumers and not for an enterprise (B2C vs. B2B, i guess). 

I enjoy my career (even though I am relatively new in it and still entry level), being that this is the first real position which I feel is really excelling me into a great career path and outlook with goals (since I was pretty lost before I started pursuing this field).

 This position has allowed me to to have goals and aspirations for what I want to strive for in my professional life. I'm starting to realizing that it would really be cool to work for a company that I'm interested or operates in the field I have interests/hobbies in - for example: Adobe would be cool because I'm a creative person and use their products all the time; or Rockstar Games because I like video game; or Oculus VR (Meta?) because I like the concept of virtual reality; or Korg because I'm into making music, or Unity, Microsoft, Apple, etc.

You guys get the point.

Essentially what I'm saying is that at my next position I would like to work for a company that  I either know, enjoy, am aware of or  like/use/know  their product/service and not a tech company that developers machine learning tractor trailer cars, warehouse databases or quantum computers (while these are all very cool and I love tech, I really want to work with a company that lies within my interests/hobbies/passion).

A little back story: graduated with a BS in Biology with hopes of becoming a pharmacist. Got accepted, but could not stop thinking about the oversaturation of the field, crippling student debt ($300,000+ on average) with decreasing pay, warnings from fellow pharmacists at my previous jobs + Reddit, etc., so I decided to go the PA route. Went an entire cycle with no acceptances, which is very common for pre-PA students, but I do not wish to fight for a spot amongst \~40 with 4000+ students for 2-3 more years without a long term job at 30. Now, I'm completely at a loss of what to do with my life.

I'm 24, have a job as a medical scribe that pays less than $17 an hour, and still living with my family. Obviously, my BS in Biology alone is not enough for lab work, *nor do I want to pursue any lab-type jobs.* I guess what I'm looking for are specific titles, that are long term careers, that I could work and sustain a livable wage($20 with room for growth), so I can at least have one worthy achievement - move out of my parent's house. I honestly have no idea what to research regarding a job that I could work long term without additional schooling, and be able to search for the specific title for job prospects..

417,"First interview in over a decade- I’m walking away from a high stress, decent paying job with lame benefits; headed towards a lower stress, lower paying job with great benefits- how do I handle the inevitable interview questions?",careerguidance,"Hello Everyone. 
I’m currently in a director level marketing position in the hospitality industry. I’ve been in this position for 10 years, and the company has experienced exponential growth during my time here. My areas of responsibility have grown right along with it. I am essentially a one person team and have no help. I make decent money, 60k per year, but I’m not being paid enough for what I do. Beyond that, there’s barely any benefits. There’s no retirement plan. Insurance is terrible. You have the same amount of vacation time if you’ve been there for 10 months or 10 years.  Holidays are a foreign word because that’s when this industry is most busy. To keep what could be an even longer story shorter, I’m over it. I want out of this industry. Covid was a hellish ride for this industry, and I want work/life balance. 

So, I have found a job that I am most likely over qualified for, but really want. It would be a marketing manager position for local government, but where I was handling 4-5 people’s jobs at my current position, I would actually be responsible for one job. One thing to really dive into! One thing that I have the skillset to thrive in! It pays less, 45k a year, but I’m in a two person home and we both work. It’s totally doable. I would say that the hourly rate isn’t even off by that much. This new job will actually be 40 hours a week with weekends off vs. 50+ with my current, and always being on call. The benefits are incredible, the kind that only a government job can offer. Same goes for retirement, paid time off and holidays off! I would be getting a major raise in quality of life.

The great news is I have an interview lined up, but I am concerned about what I assume are the inevitable questions:
- why are you leaving you current job?
- why would you want to go from a director level position to a manager position? (Would you get bored)
- why would you be okay with taking such a pay cut?

And any other question I might not be thinking of. I haven’t had a real interview in over a decade, so I don’t know exactly what to expect and how much I should actually reveal. I know not to say “I’m ready to coast through the rest of my life.” And, I would never badmouth my current company. I am actually excited at the thoughts of getting to be to focused on one thing I really enjoy and know I can become an asset for them in this position… can’t lie though, I am excited that it won’t be nearly as stressful.

So what do you think? How do I address these questions and what else should I be prepared to address? One more question, when the interviewer asks me to give them some background on myself, should I actually talk about who I am outside of work or just keep it career focused?"

I've managed to keep in touch with my old boss since then, and when I graduated, he helped put in a good word for me at a few companies—one of which I'm currently working at. My dream publisher is the company he works at, though, because of the great pay, friendly work culture, and impressive reputation, but there haven't been any openings in my desired department in years because people typically don't leave once they get hired (most editors have been there 10+ years). 

My old boss and a few other folks at the company got promoted, so it looks like there will be a few openings in the coming months as folks move around within the department. I know there’s a business need because they don't have enough editorial assistants for the department, which has meant a lot of the executives have been sharing assistants. My main goal is to join the company as an editorial assistant and then work my way up in the following years, but I have no idea how to bring it up with my old boss without seeming desperate. 

He actually invited me out to lunch with him later this month, and I'm hoping to be able to bring it up then; I'm just not sure how to ask in a way where it feels natural to the conversation. I also wonder if this is something I should even be bringing up at the lunch; I don't want to seem like I'm just keeping in touch with him in hopes of landing a job. And if this is something I should bring up, should I hint at it or go the more direct approach? In essence, what is the best way to get him to think of me when the editorial assistant positions open up?"

I'm moving to Florida for my Dad's new job,we made an agreement that if I go to school and pay for it myself,I don't have to pay rent till I'm done with school or get my own place.

This is a huge advantage and I'm not going to waste my time.Im working full-time and saving all my money other than the bills I pay.

I'm going to attend massage school,and combine Massage Therapy with Corrective Exercises from my Personal Training Experience to help reduce pain.

After this I'm going to get my Associate's in PTA, Physical Therapy Assistant.

While seeing how the healthcare world works,I'm going to get my bachelor's in Business and Management with a Healthcare focus.I want to open my own clinic and hire a Physical Therapist or kinesiologist to work for me.

After this,I want to get my Masters in Human Movement Science to be a Clinical Exercise Physiologist and/or a kinesiologist to assist in my business.


After a while,I would also like to open a Trade School to teach kids about to or have graduated highschool how to be Physical Therapy Aids, Personal Trainers,Massage Therapy,and Certified Nursing Assistant.

This is my plan and all of these colleges are relatively affordable for the degrees.Not more than 6,000 a year.Im going to go full-time until grants run out and just take one class or more depending on what I can afford at a that time.I will have my Associate's paid off by then though with a estimated Salary of 40,000-70,000 after you get experience.30,000-40,000 your first year.

I'm also investing in an IRA,high interest savings/checkings,and a general investing account at the moment,and just generally trying to break my families cycle of poverty.All these colleges are relatively affordable and I should be able to avoid debt with grants and being able to save more money with my situation.Is this a good career plan and do these degrees connect to each other in a way they would assist one another?"

This means I had to find a new client within the company to work for aka I will be transitioning laterally to a completely new team but with the same position and responsibilities. I met with different teams and although I wasn't that interested in them (there wasn't much to choose from), HR sent me an offer for one of the teams right away and rushed me to respond to the offer within a day or two so they can get me situated before Christmas break. Without much time to think, I accepted the offer...

Over break, I couldn't stop thinking about how I could've negotiated my salary but brushed it off since my current salary isn't the worst. It wasn't until I heard that subordinates on my previous team got promoted to my position and are also making a higher salary than me on their new teams before I started beating myself up about it. I have nearly 9 months of experience in this position over the others and have taken on more than what was expected of me during this time. I really think that I value more than what's my salary is worth in this economy and am confident that I can offer more with my experience.

I really like working for this agency and plan on doing so as long as I feel valued, but I also know I can walk out to another agency and make more money. So, the question is, how do I negotiate/ask for a higher salary from my new manager AFTER I already accepted the offer? I haven't worked with them yet since I'm still in the transition phase, so I'm not sure if talking about my past performance would make sense. I'm confident in my value but don't know how to phrase it since not a lot of negotiations tips online happen after accepting an offer.

430,Financial Analyst or Loan officer?,careerguidance," 

I am having a hard time deciding which career path to choose in fear that one opportunity will be better than the other and I will miss out and valuable growth.

I am in my mid 30s and and graduated last year with a bachelors in finance. I recently started as a financial analyst for the state I live in making mid 50s salary. I also was offered a position as a loan officer for Wells Fargo making 16 x hr plus commision that starts in a week. I did accept it as I am interested in the opportunity to make over over 70k year one and over 100k year 2.

The reason I am having trouble deciding is because they both have great potential. As a financial analyst I work from home and I am learning a lot new skills sql, tableu, advanced excel, and some other programs. Also I am left alone to work autonomously and there is no micromanagement. Also this industry is one in where there is plenty of advancement it is just going to take time to get to that 100k mark which is one of the things I am really after. I am thinking 4-5 years.

As loan officer there is potential to earn a large income sooner, within 2 years I could reach the 100k mark. Also, down the road I can take the skills and knowledge I have learned and consider doing under a brokerage and then for myself as an entrepreneur. The down side is the market is volatile and there is no telling what the next 3 years will bring the mortgage industry.

My dilemma is that if I leave my current position as a financial analyst and don't like it at Wells Fargo I would have lost valuable time growing as a financial analyst. On the flipside I feel like I am not reaching my full earning potential in my current position.

Just looking for some advice, insight, or suggestions. Also to see if anybody has been in a similar position and what you did?"

I had a question about whether to take the GMAT or GRE. I’m currently a college senior majoring in econ and math, with a Financial Analyst job lined up for after college. I have no idea what i want to do with my life/career, but have an interest in potentially becoming a risk manager , or something related to cybersecurity. 

I want to take the GMAT or GRE before I graduate so I don’t have to study for it later. Through research I basically found out that if I’m set on getting my MBA, to take the GMAT, and for any other masters, to take the GRE. My issue is that I am unsure if I want my MBA later or if I’d want something like a masters in risk management or cybersecurity. Because I’m unsure, should I take the GRE which can be used for both business schools and grad schools?

Thank you!"
437,"How do I recover from a toxic work environment, and regain my confidence/self worth?",careerguidance," Mid 30s, married, no kids, HCOL area, mid level title (Sr. Manager / Director), \~10 years of total experience. Diploma in Eng. , BA, finishing MS of DS. $170K (base, startup salary...stock options available after year 1).

I transitioned from a F500 role to a startup, because I felt very underused, and that I had a tremendous opportunity at the startup to really make an impact.

I believe I did, but was given an immense workload (80 hour weeks....Sat + Sun calls). I handled most of it very well, but although I surely needed to improve (as anyone does), there were a tremendous amount of things outside of my control that made my job really difficult (from office politics, to toxic abuse - colleagues talking down to me/behind my back regularly), no support - case in point when I was working i was always the only one on site.....now that I've been re'orgd all the guys show up to help the new guy in charge....straight office politics / immaturity.

It hurts....I've put in a tremendous amount of time and effort in my career, but don't really feel like I have enough to show for it. No debt, no mortgage (HCOL - home ownership is insane), \~$100K saved up....No kids, but of an emotional wreck at home.....yes I enjoyed life, travelled, saw the world and had a great career (in general) so far, but boy do I feel like I fell from grace....

Life's been tough this year.....I went from F500 politics to.....Startup Politics......I know I am partly to blame...but I pushed back on feeling underused and underappreciated....and blew up on a colleague....he deserved it for being manipulative and painting bad narratives about me....spoke to him already about it once, he did it twice.....not cool. I was overworked, underappreciated, and my boss loves me, but I kind of feel like he seems me as a slave of his to keep doing all of his dirty work.

This situation has put me in a bit of a career spiral....my industry is underpaying (industrial) vs. tech.....and with a MS of DS and real world experience...I am thinking I should just pivot and move from Director / Mgr level to DS and maybe build up my skillset as a DS there.

I'm kind of lost as you can probably tell.....huge blow to my ego working at this startup....I wanted to prove myself to a growing org, make an impact....my boss reassures me and says I'm great, but I can't shake the feeling of those creeping voices in my head telling me I'm not good enough, should have never been a director, don't know what I'm doing.....some of my toxic colleagues...

I'm kind of lost....appreciate guidance, insight, shared experiences as well."

445,Is my boss being racist for assigning me harder work than my black/white coworkers?,careerguidance,"Hello my reddit friends, I work for a non profit organization in midwest, a state not very diverse. I'm an Asian female, many people think I'm quiet, hardworking and smart. I'm a property accountant and take care of all accounting aspects of 9 apartments( it is really exhausting job). I joined this company around the same time with a black male coworker and a white female coworker.

 I didn't know too much about each property until I stay some months with this company to find out my black and white coworkers are doing easier properties than me. we work with property managers on a daily basis, apparently my property managers are either inexperienced(make lots of mistakes) or irresponsible (ignore my emails), which makes my job very difficult. on the other hand, my black and white coworkers are dealing with easier/more straightforward properties. We have trackers for financial reporting/audit and all other projects, which lists out accountant name and tasks to do. every time I check the tracker I see I always have a bunch of things to do while my black/white coworkers have a lot of N/A for their tasks. Although we are assigned with the same amount of properties, but I actually spend much more time on each property because mine are more complicated and have more mistakes to correct. 

I can tell my bosses (managers/mentors) have high expectations about me, if I fail to understand some things, instead of explaining to me in detail they would only give me part of the answer and expect me to figure out. if I still don't understand, they just tell me they don't see the ambition/curiosity in me.

Coming from a minority family I have been submissive and quiet my whole life. the weak version of me tells me that it is a compliment that they give me harder work to do because they think I'm smart. there is also another voice that tells me this is not ok, they should not distribute work to employees based on race especially we are paid the same. how is that fair that I get to work more while getting paid the same? a lot of times having a more complicated property does not mean I get to learn more stuffs, it just means I need to do one single thing over and over again. for instance, we need to void checks monthly, having easier property means you need to do it 2-3 times while I have to do it more than 100 times. everyone knows how to do it after 10 seconds training but having to do it so many times more than my black/white coworkers just piss me off. It sucks when I get questioned about my capabilities while my black/white coworkers get praised. 

I'm thinking about quitting this job soon because I also realized that it is only fair if I'm assigned similar work with everyone else, and then I get promoted if I'm doing better than others. It is not fair if I'm assigned with more difficult work while black/white getting easier work then they get promoted before me.

If you work for the media, how is it?",careerguidance,"I'm currently a nurse and have been for 4 years. While I've not exhausted every single speciality in nursing yet, I've known for a while it's never going to be my forever job. This is not me bashing nurses, there are some really amazing ones out there, but I find the profession as a whole to be overtly toxic and bad for my mental health. I have some beautiful stories, and have met some lovely patients. It really gives you an appreciation for the little things in life, but the bad heavily outweighs the good for me. It's not a profession I have found that recognises individual talents and encourages creativity. If anything, it takes away from your voice and your personality if you're anything remotely different. It all got too much for me a couple of months back, and I've taken a break for my mental health. I do need to go back eventually but I know it's not gonna be forever now which really feels good.

I've said for a long time now I wish I had got into Journalism. The longer I've had off work, the more passionate I've felt that this isn't just a pipe dream. My original plan was to go back to study it, but the more I've looked into the media as an umbrella term, there are so many other areas I also find attractive. These include radio and TV production, creative writing and even Advertising. I think based on this I may be best doing a more generic media course than something pigeonholed to journalism. I'm from the UK so courses would start around September/October. 

My current nursing job does pay well. The best it ever will unless I was to get a promotion. The money doesn't bother me however. I'd genuinely rather get by, knowing I'm pursuing a dream, than be better off but hating 5/7 days of my life. Part of me is tempted to apply for train on the job TV opportunities that arise. One of the positives of nursing is you can always keep it as a back up, which if this dream does turn out to be nonsense, I could always crawl back with tears in my eyes or do it part time for a little extra income. I'm wondering is it best to just quit my full time job now, work part time and apply for what opportunies arise until college time? Or should I wait for now and try to actually learn the academic side of it and go from there?

Any advice of people who've walked away from professions to pursue more creative goals would be greatly appreciated? Also any advice on what you think is the best thing for me to do here. Either way I'm applying for one of the courses starting this year. I know that for certain and feel a million times better than when I was last at work."

In college, I was really interested in project management because I like scheduling, working in teams, coaching/learning constantly. However, I didn't realize that is something you can get into only once you have actually specialized in something such as civil engineering which would require more education at this point. 

I also know the tech field is very wide and has lots of opportunities but I'm not sure what I'd I want to go into since there's so many options such as IT, software development, data analytics, and more.

I'm also open to doing something relevant to my degrees but I'm not sure where to start or what is available out there for me. 

A little bit about me: When I was in college, I did pretty well academically while working 2 part time jobs and doing other on the side things so I can handle stress well and manage multiple things at once. I'm interested in having the option of working remote. I am open to the idea of pursuing more education."

475,Which health professions path should I take?,careerguidance," Hi! I'm torn between several paths. I worked in fitness prior to the pandemic in the form of personal training, group exercise, and running a gym for a company. My current job is at a Physical Therapy and Chiropractic clinic which I went for because I was applying to Occupational Therapy school and I'm still waiting to hearing back on. But I've realized I really like Chiropractic. I found a Chiro school I really like that I could start next semester. However, between OT, PT, and DC, a lot of people aren't happy with their career. As a DC, there are a lot of services I could provide, but it will be pretty tough to open a business after all the debt from school.

I was also looking into Osteopathic Medicine as a lot of people recommend that over Chiropractic as well as Nurse Practitioner and Physician's Assistant. As a D.O., they have their own technique to Manipulations and can prescribe medication - which are the two big things I'd like to do. And I'd be much more networked and related to medical cannabis which I'm currently in a Masters program for. But I haven't really prepared for medical school. My bachelors is in Exercise Science with a 3.6 GPA, and I'll finish my Medical Cannabis Masters next year with hopefully a 4.0. I'd have to take a couple chemistry and physics courses as well as the MCAT and get some hours somewhere to give D.O. a shot. So I'm really on the fence on where to invest my time and money. But to sum it all up, the things I'm interested in:

Manipulations/adjustments

Prescribing medication

Medical Cannabis

Fitness

Nutrition

Consultations/ Counseling

But overall therapy/helping people

Any advice is appreciated."

482,"If I don't get a degree, am I going to be stressed and broke forever?",careerguidance,"A bit of background, I'm 24 and I'm currently living at home. My mental health is pretty bad in general (which is how I ended up back at home in the first place), and I get stressed quite easily. I recently tried to go back to school to get a 2 year degree in IT, but I realized 1) I was terrible at it, and 2) I wasn't enjoying it. Now I'm being pressured to either go back to school for something else (which unfortunately, due to mental health and procrastinating I have less than a week to decide), or get a job.

There are no degrees at the tech school/community college near me that I'm interested in. I was really set on IT, so that not working out has really put me in a stressful situation. The only things I'm remotely interested in are four year degrees that would be very hard to find a job in (wildlife rehabiliation/zoology), and I don't want to put in four years of effort and money only to be stuck at the same position I'm in now.

Now, I wouldn't mind just getting a random job, but everyone I've talked to has told me that if I don't get some sort of degree, I'm going to be struggling for the rest of my life money and stress wise. I don't mind settling for a job, as long as it's something I don't hate and dread having to go to every morning. Something like a desk job would be fine, but I've looked in my area (smaller city, around 18k people) and it seems that most jobs either want experience (how am I supposed to get experience when they all want that for entry level jobs) or a degree. I'm just really stuck on what to do and could use some advice.

TLDR, main questions:

1) If I choose to not pursue any form of degree or tech school, will I be able to make a living and be comfortable? If anyone has gone this route and is willing to share what they do, I would very much appreciate it.

2) Would it be worth getting an associates (with no interest in pusuing a bachelors) in something like business management, even though that's not really what I'm into at all? I figured maybe something broad like that would open some doors, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

Any and all advice would be appreciated. Sorry if I didn't word this great, I'm just a bit stressed out. Thank you so much in advance!"

I've been working in retail my whole life and I'm sick of it. I started working retail in highschool. I went to college and earned  a degree in both psychology and business administration. I continued working in retail during college to pay the bills because my family didn't have the money to help me out. After graduation, I applied for jobs but even the ""entry level"" ones expected experience that I didn't have.. so I stayed in retail.. fast forward ten years and I'm.. wait for it.. still.. in.. retail.

485,"How can I figure out if I might like a career without fully committing to it, and should I look to find a new career?",careerguidance,"This is my first time posting here, but I'm hoping for some guidance. I'm going to share a little bit about my situation for some context as well. 

I (27M) am currently working as a massage therapist for a clinic that is about 10 mins from my house. I've been a MT for about 3 years now, and I'm unsure whether or not to continue. I like a lot of things about this career (which I will list below), and some things I dislike/worry about in regards to the career/career path. 

Pros:

* Agency/Autonomy over own schedule (which I highly value)
* Compensated well for performed work (\~$70/hour pre-tax) 
* Low stress 
* Work CAN be rewarding 
* Affords me some free time (I do not work 40 hours a week)

Cons 

* No benefits/vacation pay etc. 
* Hard on my joints (wrist/hands, etc.) 
* Work can be dull/repetitive/boring
* Often work in isolation, which makes collaboration hard
* Difficult to work 30+ hrs a week (due to physical nature of job)

My main issue with the career is I feel like its very difficult to fully meet my financial goals purely trading time for money, without much potential for an increase in yearly income. I'm worried I will eventually be able to afford life expenses (house, car, groceries) and still afford a lifestyle (which is very minimal at the moment). I will admit that my energy and enthusiasm for this career has faded a bit, however I'm not sure if that is ""caregiver burnout"" or if its just because I have more of an interest in exercise, rehab, and fitness (clients come to me for more general wellness, and I've had trouble aligning my current massage practice with these interests)

My first question is, does this sound like a career I should change out of based on my needs/wants?

I've been looking at other careers such as becoming **a teacher or firefighter** (mainly because I believe I have skills that would make me good at these careers, thus getting more joy out of them, rather than just being a means to afford living), and each career seems to align with a lot of my values and interests. However,  I'm unsure if I'll fully enjoy these careers. I usually don't know for sure if I will like something until I see the in's and out's of it and almost experience a day (or week) in the life of a certain job/career. With this in mind, my second question is does anyone have any suggestions for ways I can find more about what a day in the life of these jobs is like? 

I've also had interests (or at least I think I'd be interested) in more corporate setting, like working in marketing, a Work From Home Job, or operating an online business, but I have absolutely 0 experience in these areas and was wondering how I might expose myself to jobs/careers so I can figure out if it might be a potential career area for me. 

Overall, I'm feeling a little lost on what my next move should be. Do I try to diversify myself in my massage career by exploring other areas within the field that align more with my interests? Or, because of my worry that I may burnout of massage therapy anyways, do I begin to pursue something new, and how can I best find out what I might like? 

Apologies for the lengthy post, and I thank everyone in advance for their responses!"

As the tittle states, I'm looking for a career I can do from home, or small rented office space, that does not demand too much of my energie, but pays well enough.

I've been struggling with mental health, and high pressure jobs and situations make my anxiety flair up like crazy, and I just burn out. So I'm looking for something that does require intelligence and creativity, but isn't high pressure and high turn-over.

I've been a social worker for the past 7 years, and working with people now just really fucks with me. Currently just working at a bakery, and it's fine, but retail is not my career of choice, and the money is not good either.

I'm quite creative, ambitious as well, I just wanna live simply, work 30 hours a week, and enjoy the rest of my time reading, making music and enjoying nature. I don't need a 6 figure job, I just wanna be comfortable with money. No fancy cars, enormous house, fancy clothing or what ever.

I have an MBA and an MS in Neuropsychology.

My previous role before this I was a researcher/statistician. But my biggest joy has always been organizing and interpreting large-ish amount of datasets in Excel, definitely not 'big data' though.

I can program in R, SAS, SQL, and Python. I can also visualize data in all those tools, and in Tableau and a few others. I don't mind any of that that, but I really loved programming macros and VBA in excel, playing with data, organizing, pivoting, formulas, etc, in Excel. I love creating awesome spreadsheets in my research and finance roles. Excel has always been my bread in butter in my 15+ years after college. I think it's because I can visualize the data via a spreadsheet. In these spreadsheets, I can spend 8+ hours all day and it feels like 5 minutes. In video games with spreadsheets like sports games, sim games, or city building games I loved pouring over these spreadsheets to improve the team, city, or whatever.

I'm looking for a career change, and I don't know what exact titles I should aim for where most of duties are analyses in Excel. And then the other heavy hitter tools like R, SQL, or Python are more like side tools. I know businesses want to have employees with the most skills for the least amount of price, so I probably have to keep that in mind too.

Thanks in advance for the advice."

I'm generally happy with my life and the choices with which I've made thus far. However, there are some days where I just go on a binge and reminisce about the previous jobs I've had, and more importantly, the people I used to work with. Although we never were close, we weren't complete strangers as well. They were people I've worked with, gosh darn it. They were people I had to learn how to communicate with, tackled projects together, and spent time with. They have made me the person I am today, so in some sense, I am thankful for them.

I've been in and out of several different fast food and factory jobs over the last four years. For one reason another they've all not worked out. I work/catch on to things a bit slower than the average person but after awhile I can get the hang of a job however most people don't have the patience for it and it also doesn't help I have problems socializing well with people which doesn't amke things better. I made a stupid mistake of leaving a job that I was hired in at where I was comfortable with the work and people to try and work as a temp at another factory which gave more hours and pay. They ended up firing me saying ""they had to talk to me too many times about not working efficiently enough"" so now I don't have a job. I'm going to see Monday if my old job can take me back. I only tried the new job since I just had a daughter and wanted to have an easier time  affording things but I suppose I should probably just learn to make due with what I have. Anyways my fiancée and other people in my family keep telling me I should have higher aspirations than just working in factories and I agree but I have no idea what to do. I check websites like Indeed and there's literally nothing in my area besides fast food, retail, and factories. I don't really want to go to college because I don't want to take on a bunch of debt for a degree I most likely won't be able to use. Nowhere around here wants to take apprentices either if I wanted to work a trade.

511,"I (19M) speak three languages (Spanish, English, Japanese) and I enjoy building PCs. But I don't know what to do with my life. Any advice?",careerguidance,"I'm 19 years old and live in Chile. I was studying at university to teach English as a foreign language. However, unsatisfied with the quality of online classes, I decided to take a semester off. I felt like I was losing my time, that I could be doing better things with my life. Although I was hopeful that maybe I'd find a reason to keep studying if classes became in-person next semester (thanks to COVID, I haven't even put a foot on the university grounds), the recent exponential rise in COVID cases has killed any hope I had.

One reason I decided to get into university to become an English teacher was because I could study it for free, with a scholarship that covered all costs. I don't particularly like or dislike the idea of becoming a teacher. That is, I do believe that I could do a good job as a teacher, but I don't have a vocation for it. If anything, I just didn't want to get in debt.

Another reason was that by becoming an English teacher, I could go abroad to teach the language. Or rather, I could go abroad and have job opportunities. I wanted to live and work in Japan as an English teacher. It was the only way I could stay in Japan and start a new life there. Regarding my Japanese skills, I'm at an intermediate level. I haven't taken any official exams, but I'm capable of writing, reading novels, and understanding spoken Japanese. I haven't had opportunities to actually speak the language, but I've studied Japanese phonetics. As for my English, I took the Cambridge FCE test and was awarded a C1 level of proficiency. Spanish is my native tongue.

The problem then is the following: if I decided to not study anymore, what could I do with my life? I do not want to get indebted by getting into another career. I want to make something of myself. I want to do something exciting, start anew. I want to feel that I'm getting somewhere. But I don't know what to do.

Something I enjoy aside from studying languages is building computers. Maybe I could move to America and work somewhere where I could do that? I mean, the best thing I have going for me is that English certificate I mentioned earlier. Moving to America may be what I'm looking for, but I'd like to hear your opinions."

I’ll spend my summers doing internships in tech/data science, which will hopefully help me get a job after I graduate. After bachelors, I’ll work full-time while pursuing my masters in stats part-time, spreading it over 3 years. I’ll aim to take classes that are required of PhD students in their first two years. After finishing my masters, I’d reflect whether I wish to pursue a PhD or stay in the work force. If I choose to do a PhD, I’ll already have knocked most required coursework out of the way and will aim to finish my PhD in 3-4 years then reflect again (most likely will return to work force and shoot for senior roles). If I choose to stay in the work force instead of doing the PhD, then I’ll have 3 yrs of work experience plus a masters so thats good, too.

514,Would this be considered wrongful termination?,careerguidance,"I started working in a lab in late November. During the interview, my boss asked me when I plan on applying to grad school and I told her it was a future thought but not something I’m thinking about right now. She then asked if I would be able to commit to at least a year or two to them and I said yes. This was a lie. I had already submitted my grad school applications for fall 2022. I was told not to say this because then I wouldn’t have gotten hired. 
It is now January and I have received a couple interview invites from schools. I feel like I should tell her before she somehow finds out from the schools in case they decide to contact her to confirm my employment or something. I also think giving her enough of a heads up would benefit her if she wants to start looking for someone else to hire. I can still work there till like July or August until I leave for grad school in the fall. I am terrified of telling her this news and don’t know how she’s going to react. I’m planning on telling her that I decided to apply just to see how competitive I was AFTER I got hired, so I don’t seem like I lied during the interview. 
My question is, would she be in the wrong to terminate me after disclosing this info? I don’t think she would because she pretty much needs me and I am still being signed off on things so firing me would be a waste of training. But maybe she could find someone to replace me, have me train them, and then let me go? Would that be considered wrongful termination? Idk I’m just nervous lol and I also just don’t want her to hate me. I don’t know how to go about this."
515,Are there any high paying jobs for shy people who are bad at math and/or coding?,careerguidance,"I’m shy but not so shy to where I would rather die than talk to someone. But a bit more shy than usual for someone my age I guess. (I’m 25) I can get rather uncomfortable when I feel forced to talk to someone when I don’t feel like it and will do anything to avoid it. 

I’m honestly just tired of being around and communicating with too many people. I currently work in a warehouse. I’ve been promised positions with higher pay and I’ve been lied to and given the run-around because management thinks I wouldn’t be a good fit because I “don’t talk very much.” They don’t admit that being the reason for not promoting me, but I know that’s why since they always seem to bring it up.

I was looking into going back to school (an online and inexpensive one) and I’m having a hard time figuring out what to major in and what careers to look into.

I’ve been to college before. It was a community college and I majored in psychology and got my Associate of Science degree. I didn’t continue with a bachelors after realizing that anything dealing with being a counselor or therapist would be a horrible fit for me. What inspired me to even do it was because I always feel like I know what is on someone’s mind and I am sometimes good at figuring people out, knowing when they’re lying, etc.

I’m also good at figuring things out and enjoy researching things to find out information, but I’m horrible at math. I’ve made a C or D in nearly every math class in college that I just barely passed and the word problems are the worst for me. 

I like computers but I would never do coding. I looked into that and it looks way too hard for someone like me who lacks in so many necessary skills to do the job.

I also seem to be good at typing and correcting grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors but it could all use a lot of improvement to be top notch.

516,Should I take promotion at a place I don’t like or restart at a new place at the same current level ?,careerguidance,"I work at a big company and last year I came very close to a promotion. A very hard promotion that very few people get. I’m in those conversations again this year but frankly I don’t like working here. I feel burnt out and have been losing my heart in it for a while. I would like to switch teams within the company and find something I would like and see myself doing for a very long time. But if I switch now the promotion clock sort of resets and I have to establish myself at the new place. It may take a year or a few years, you never know. Promotions aren’t always about skill and hard work. 

The only inclination I feel to stay is that promotion since it is a hard nut to crack in my company, i feel I should endure and get that promotion for which I worked hard so far. The promotion hasn’t been given yet but I feel like I might be close to cracking that ceiling here compared to a new team. But the idea of working here makes me sad and depressed.

The current job I got is within the healthcare field (kinda) dealing with customers calling in being mean and upset about either something they did or didn’t understand or refuse to look online. With this job I’m learned a lot of things but not enough experience to translate it to anything else. This the most money I ever made even though it’s not much (18 an hour) and the first adult like job I ever had. But I’m at a point where enough is enough. 

I don’t know what other field I can break into. I’m not all that smart and have a sociology degree which is basically pointless. At this point I don’t know what to so.

521,Should I tell my job that we're expecting?,careerguidance,"Tossing this out into the Internet as I've exhausted all personal and professional sources. 

We're about four months in and I haven't told my company that we're expecting. In my mind, it's really none of their business and as long as my work doesn't change (we both work from home), being away for two weeks won't be a big deal. It'd be like asking for time to take a vacation where I don't have to tell them where I'm going or doing. Her mom and dad will be staying with us (which is amazing) for two months to help keep the house and dogs good to go as well as help the wife who is totally onboard with me not saying anything.

But I wonder if this hurts me at all? I know telling them doesn't HELP me at all either, but I really like this job and I'm trying to make FTE (am contractor). I know eventually it'll slip out because I'm just over the moon excited about our first child (a baby boy) coming into the world and there's no way I'll be silent.

Any advice on the matter would be appreciated."
522,"Desperately bored, need adventure -- what would you recommend?",careerguidance,"I'm currently in a software-related role making pretty good money. The thing is, I've become extremely bored with sitting in front of a computer all day. I'm a doer, and I hate just sitting around staring at a screen. The boredom is bad enough where I'm struggling to be productive and focus. I get my work done but it's not challenging anymore, and even if it were I'd still prefer to be moving around.

I've got two hobbies that provide some excitement (volunteer firefighter/EMT and drumming), however with two kids and the full time job I'm limited when I can do those things. So I feel like the best alternative for me is a career change, either another job or starting/buying a business.

I've looked into outdoor careers as the first logical choice, but I'm the sole earner for my family until my youngest starts school in a couple years and those careers just don't pay enough AFAIK (even in LCOL areas). I'd rather not go back to school (I already have three degrees), so I'm wondering if starting some kind of outdoor business would be my best bet.

I guess I'm just looking for ideas or advice for where to go next? Or if anyone has experience doing something similar while also supporting a family (we're pretty frugal so it doesn't obviously need to be a 6 figure venture)?"

I’m super grateful for the opportunity and plan on working as hard as I can to kill it and eventually get AE and keep progressing.

The thing is, I still want to get a degree at some point, both for my own personal growth and for growing my salary in the future. I’m just having a hard time seeing how this is going to be possible. Do I try and crush it as an SDR for a year, get AE, and eventually start going back to school online? Get an online associates while working and eventually transfer to a four year college? Get the whole thing online?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."

529,How to properly quit my job? Non-unanimous points to address.,careerguidance,"There are several videos on YouTube regarding this topic, however the Questions below are not unanimous on how to properly proceed. 

**Background:** I joined my current company 8 years ago and everything was going well until a Chinese group bought part of the business here. Lot of changes, including pay cuts, long hours, lack of communication, no perspective in the long term. At first, I was well inclined to accept changes and embraced the situation by running my department with minimal resources and people. Delivered exceptional results with 1/10 of competitor's resources. However, last month they announced they are bringing people from a third-party company (Chinese) to do exactly what my team does here. In this sense, we will need to work in the same building and share several equipment (I lead a R&amp;D discovery team). I got very frustrated, applied, received, and accepted a job offer from a competitor and need to quit my job in the next few days.

**Question 1:** Should I tell my boss the real reason I am leaving, as described above? Or should I just say how incredible was that opportunity he gave me?

**Question 2:** Should I disclose where I am going? It is a competitor and they know each other.

**Question 3:** What should I say to my team, my direct reports? I really like them.

Thank you."

When I left the company, it felt like no one really kept in touch with me. I only talk to about 3 of the people that used to work there.

I feel like it's odd because it seemed to me like I was being treated as a good employee by the company but when I left it's like they don't care. Maybe that's just how companies are."

In the meantime, I want to keep working and to save up for med school, does anyone have any suggestions as to what jobs I can apply to within the healthcare field (am thinking of pharma/medtech/healthtech, from a softer angle e.g., sales/marketing – how feasible is this in your opinion)? I'm not expecting anything clinical.

In terms of previous experience, I have a law degree at undergraduate level, also from the UK and have been doing my legal training for the last 3 years since graduating. I really don’t want to stay in law anymore and am really looking forward to making the switch to healthcare asap.

As an additional question, based on the above do you reckon I should mention on my applications that I’ll be heading off to med school in 2023?

538,Is it normal to give notice for a contract?,careerguidance,"I just completed an 18 week placement, the company wanted to offer me a part time role but my supervisor went on vacation (and extended it) and was aware of my end date and didn’t present the contract to me. 

I ultimately made the decision to decline the role, knowing it was part time (and knowing the company’s financial situation) and that it wouldn’t be enough for me to quit my second part time job. 

I sent a professionally worded e-mail thoroughly explaining my decision (at their request) and I outlined everything I am leaving behind on their computer so whoever takes my role on next has materials (I started from scratch). I also offered to wait to log out of the company instagram and post outside of my contract because the supervisor is back on a birthday (which gets a post). I’ve also prepared 20? instagram posts, they just need to do a caption. I created a “guidebook” for my role because it is a combination of 3/4 roles. 

Supervisor is extremely upset that I chose to decline the contract without seeing it, and says I ruined their vacation, and now blames me for all the incoming stress they have to face. They also said something along the lines of “regardless of your contract, you should have given professional respect and gave proper notice”. Is this normal for a contract? I assumed an end date was an end date, and the other intern that started with me didn’t need to give notice?

I feel really guilty, I’ve been told I handled this entire situation VERY well. This was a placement from hell for me and I don’t think ANY role has ever made me cry as much as this one did.

543,"I think I'm suffering from ""impostor syndrome"" for the first time in my career and it feels awful. How does one shake it off?",careerguidance,"Last year, I made the decision to move overseas (on a work visa) and find a new job in a large, global city. Right away, I found a job with a very good company. I'm now 2 months into my 90 day probation, and I think it's safe to say I'm feeling what I think a lot of people refer to as ""impostor syndrome"".

Every day, I wake up with this idea that my company isn't going to keep me, that they made a mistake by hiring someone like me or that I don't deserve to be in this role. I've been roped into a ton of projects and am now being asked to help with various things across the company within the next month, so I keep trying to tell myself that if I didn't belong in this role, surely I wouldn't have already been asked to get involved with this many things. However, I just can't seem to shake the anxiety.

I think the fact that I'm from another country has a lot to do with it, but I also think that being in a much larger, global city has made me feel a bit insecure. A lot of people at my new company are really experienced and have worked with much bigger companies in the past. I also feel like since moving to this new city, everything seems to be working out so well for me and this isn't how my life usually went back in my former city -- so I keep having this overwhelming sense that one day things are just going to back to my version of ""normal"" and that my work and personal lives aren't going to go well. For example, a number of years ago I went through a really difficult period in my life when I was let go from a former job and it really affected my self esteem. I was also really unhappy with the last job I had back home and dealt with a lot of burnout. So now that I've finally entered this new phase in my life, I can't help but question how much I really have deserved it, as awful and self-deprecating as this sounds.

I really love this new job and the direction my ""new life"" has gone into, and I so badly want to make a good impression on this company and not lose this opportunity. I also really did work so hard before I came here and got this new opportunity (I had my full time job and also did freelance work on the side to leverage my portfolio), so I really do try to remind myself that I didn't just get this opportunity handed to me or whatever. However, there are some days where I am really plagued with anxiety over it and I really don't want this to affect how well I do my job or even just my general mental health.

Wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how they may have shaken these feelings off."
544,Move into teaching or stick to communications ?,careerguidance,"Two years ago I switched to working in communications  from a decade working in journalism and publishing. I thought it would be a successful switch - high demand, work remotely, chance to utilize skill set -  but I realise I dislike the communications field.  I thought it was to do with working for a non-profit, but I realise it is more of values clash than anything else. When I worked in journalism and publishing I worked in print and now everything is digital I am reluctant to pursue any path that is highly focused on it.   


Originally I planned to become an English professor but after my MA I decided not to pursue a PhD and trained as a journalist instead. I quietly regret not pursuing academia but have recently thought of teaching English at high school instead.  I love working with and mentoring young people, I am a disciplinarian with a sense of humor, and it would be great to pass on my subject knowledge and passion for literature.   


However:   
\- While I am drawn to teaching, I a little fearful that it may be stressful career path nor the rewarding or fulfil career that I hope it will be. I may also become frustrated for not pursuing my original plan of academia. Plus, it is a couple of years training and I am now 37 and need to think about whether or not I will be having children. 

\- I could go back to being a freelance editor for publishing houses while working in communications part time. I also write fiction so it would be a nice balance. I thoroughly enjoyed being an editor but am exhausted by precarity and instability. Teaching would be much more stable.

I’m 100% being taken advantage of, and others see it too. I don’t want to leave necessarily but I’m miserable. 60 hours a week is the norm, and my overtime pay is roughly what my base hourly pay should be. I’m tired and burnt out. Rumor has it there’s going to be an ownership change soon, and I’ve been hanging on waiting to see what happens with that, but I can’t keep it together much longer. My options are to either go straight to the top and tell them this, at the risk of being simply replaced, or just say fuck it and leave. I’m sort of in a tough spot (read: I don’t have “f-you” money saved up), so it would be ideal to just stick it out for awhile but I can’t do it for much longer.

546,Should I follow up on internal interview?,careerguidance,"Hello. Unsure if this is the right sub for this question.

I was among the first, if not the first to interview for an internal position at my present employer. The internal position opened up and I applied and immediately after drafted a letter of interest and sent it to the hiring manager. She contacted me and scheduled and interviewed by virtual meeting the following day. One comment she made was that I was unfamiliar with OSHA regulations but that was no issue as that could be taken care off by me attending training and learning on the job. Interview ended with - “we will keep the posting open for a few more weeks and interview other candidates as the position just opened yesterday. There could be a second interview in a couple of weeks at our corporate office (the position is a corporate role).”

It was discussed that I will be finishing my BS in Occupational Health and Safety in 1 1/2 yrs, and shortly after apply for CSP certification.

Would it be okay to follow up after the second week and mention “Per one of your concerns, I went ahead and familiarized myself further on OSHA regulations by attending the 10 and 30 hour OSHA courses; here are my certificates”.

Want to show initiative without sounding desperate or foolish. Any advice is welcomed.

I don’t believe anything sketchy is going on as this is a very reputable company. And I’ve worked within the company before. But the contract will be managed by a third party.

Is there any way I can negotiate this contract to be full time? For example, willing to take a pay cut to turn this job into full time.

The core theme of OR seems to aggregate and bring clarity to many scattered interests I've accrued over the years but have never been able to put into words. All of a sudden, I'm not as certain about computer science and have been looking into master's in Operations Research, Applied Math, as well as a few unique programs in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization ([ACO](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/phd/program/joint-phd-programs/algorithms-combinatorics-and-optimization/index.html)).

I would just go ahead and pursue a comprehensive masters in OR/applied math, however, there are a few hang ups:

1. As much as I know that it's not everything, I value employability and I know that I will be able to get a job fairly easily with a CS degree.
2. I have a minor in CS, so getting into a graduate program will not be difficult. I meet all of the prereqs for most CS masters programs and am already in the process of applying for a few. By contrast, I do not have that many math classes under my belt. I will be graduating in a couple of months and have only taken stats, discrete math, and linear algebra. I have gotten mediocre grades in these classes and I assume most applied math grad programs require that applicants have stronger math background.
3. There is already significant overlap between OR/applied math and CS. I think I would be able to do good work in the OR field as someone with training in algorithm development, etc.

Essentially, I am in dilemma and would greatly appreciate any advice as to which program I should apply to (CS or OR/applied math). Thank you!

**tl;dr** \- I enjoy making and applying models and algorithms to gain insights and make better decisions across multiple domains. I have a minor in CS. Should I apply for a MS in CS or MS in applied math/operations research."

What's would be the easiest way to go about this? Move to a city before obtaining a job and apply when I get there while staying a long term rental/airbnb?

I currently have to decide between accepting my law or med school offer or doing something I am really good at. I was always good with children so I think I am a good fit for an elementary school teacher or study something related to my interests (history and political science). My dad says I should do something with business, my mum says I should not waste my potential and go to med school. My dad and my mum are both sceptical of law school since it is super long in my country (7 years until being able to work). 

My mum and dad both pointed out that it is important to have money, so please do not get me wrong, I know you should never become a doctor or lawyer for the money, but realistically, both are a stable careers and it is way better to help others instead of doing something which does not help you or others to grow. I am just afraid that I will become a teacher and then be stuck because I idealised working with children and following my passion. I am also afraid of studying history with politics and then not being able to find a job. I value stability and helping others, so med or law would be a good fit too, but maybe not where my strengths are. I am so terrified of making the wrong move and decision :/

593,Destroyed my professional reputation due to a breakdown and addiction. Is there a way to recover from this and maintain my career?,careerguidance," 

Before    reading this, please don't judge me as a scumbag. I already feel that     way and I have a lot of guilt over the whole situation. First off, I   am a grad student at a top 10 department in my field.

Just     to give you some backdrop, I have been using this drug called Kratom     for about 7 years. I have used other drugs and drank quite a bit as     well. Without going super in detail, I was rejected from this  position    at work.  My friends (other grad students) were part of this  position and they basically  demoted   me without giving me an  explanation. Now, this isn't a huge  deal, but I   was extremely  emotionally unstable during that time. It  was during the   pandemic, I  lost my girlfriend, my dog was dying, my work was  not going   well at  all, and I guess it triggered a PTSD attack. I also  realized my    friends really disliked me and it triggered traumatic  memories from my    childhood from being bullied. I had a breakdown and  admitted on   Facebook  how much I hated myself, how I felt everyone  hated me. Also,   during a  work meeting I accidentally mentioned I had a  drinking  problem  and my  parents were alcoholics (which is partially  true, but I  made it  sound it  much worse).  I wanted to kill myself and  in my  twisted logic  I wanted  to commit professional suicide. I just  felt  that I was  worthless and I  wanted other people to hate me and  view me  with  contempt as much I felt  about myself.

So,    fast forward I  got clean and sober and I'm trying to repair my    reputation at work.  Somehow I didn't get fired. No one spoke with me    and my job was not  threatened, but obviously my reputation is in the    gutter. I feel the  most I can do now is just stay clean and sober and    my work will speak  for itself. I've been nothing but kind to everyone,    been super  respectful, and I am doing everything in my power to show    I'm not this  person anymore, but it is really hard. I could use some    advice on how to  approach this situation from here on out and how to    forgive myself.  This happened about 6 months ago, but because of    quarantine this image  of me is the last thing my coworkers saw."
594,Should I pursue Data Science or go into Cyber Security?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone!

I'm in my mid 20's. I've been working as a DevOps engineer for about 2 years, working primarily on automating infrastructure and application deployments with a dabble of some proof of concept development work.

I want to add something on top of this knowledge to branch out and myself relevant 10-20-30 years down the line. So I am considering Data Science or Cyber Security as fields which I could venture into.

Here's some info about me/my intentions:

* On the Data Science side, I graduated with a Masters degree in Information Systems focusing on ML/AI a couple of years ago.
* I have no prior knowledge in Cyber Security.
* Evaluating myself, I feel like while I can make my way around in the programming side of things, I'm not the brightest out there. Sometimes I find it hard to solve abstract questions which from my limited knowledge is a lot about development.
* I would also need to really work on statistics to get back into shape with data science stuff.
* While the cyber security path wouldn't necessarily be easier or even equally as hard, I am ready to work my rear off.
* A couple of acquaintances who worked in cyber security mentioned my DevOps knowledge would be really welcome in the field,
* Is this the case in the data science field too? 

What I'm trying to understand is given my current state which path would put me in a good place long term?

P.S. My goal is to get deep into the triple digit salary ranges. While I understand money isn't everything, I have certain life goals/desires that require that kind of money. I also realize I need to be the Michael Jordan league of either field to be paid that much.

Thanks in advance!"

597,I've been training for 2.5 months and I'm not sure what my supervisor thinks of my work performance. Should I be worried I'm underperforming at work?,careerguidance,"I started a job 2.5 months ago and I'm still in training. For my position, I'm in charge of 2 tasks and although I was able to start doing the first task with none/little supervision, the second part of my training has been stressing me out since I can't tell if I'm supposed to be done with training at this point of my job.

For the second task of my training, I'm in charge of catching inconsistencies with reports, along with adding keywords and fixing any grammar within the reports. Usually, these reports are put into a queue and I'm supposed to reassign them to myself to do. Since I'm still in training, my supervisor is the one reassigning it to me and reviewing my findings before I send it in for completion. Although I'm getting the hang of the process, I'm not sure how my supervisor feels about letting me do these on my own.

I've been doing this part of my training for a month now and although I'm able to call out/fix most of the consistencies on my own. I think my supervisor doesn't feel like I'm ready because I wanted to request ""unnecessary"" keywords to include in the report. It bothers me since sometimes my supervisor would tell me I didn't include these keywords in the report, but the next time I do call it out, she tells me it's not necessary. This has been going on for a few weeks and I feel like she's getting annoyed about repeating these ""mistakes"" back to me (She eventually set some things up for consistencies). Based on the way she writes her emails, she seems

Although I have been calling out every big mistake and correcting the grammar in the reports, I think she just doesn't want me to go back to the analyst with the ""unnecessary changes"" before she ""graduates"" me and allows me to become independent. She said she was planning to graduate me from training this week, but she wants to see me do more before that happens. What's worse is my manager started bi-weekly training updates this week and I told him I was close to finishing, so I'm not sure what to tell him if my supervisor doesn't allow me to become independent.

Note, the last person who was hired before me took around 2.5 months to complete her training, so I'm slightly late to completion compared to her. I'm also not sure how long they expect trainees to complete their training, so that's why I'm stressed out about my performance. 

Am I overthinking things and If I don't graduate this week from my training, what should I tell my manager?"

Technology is just so brand new that people who are older barley have a technical background which is huge in- terms finding a job. You cant say that with most degrees like business or engineering.

I'd say the order of the most potential tech degrees go by computer science-software engineering-computer engineering-information security-information Technology- information systems- then insert any other non technical degree here

614,Should I pay for a Master's in Computer Science or opt for Tech Bootcamp?,careerguidance,"In a few months, I'll be graduating from college with a degree in a science field and a minor in computer science (CS). Early in my junior year, I attempted to switch my major to CS, however, was told the department was ""at capacity"" so I settled for the minor.

Since then I've been doing my best to position myself in the tech space, however, I feel like not having the CS credentials has been holding me back.  For example, I lack a comprehensive understanding of advanced algorithms and other upper level CS topics because those classes are mostly restricted to CS majors at my institution. Additionally, most tech job applications don't even have my major in their drop down menu when I need to select what my bachelor's degree is in (It's a struggle).

I am considering getting a MS in computer science, so that I can finally gain the formal training/credentials in computer science that I missed out on, but I am slightly hesitant. I'm not sure if I'm ready to fork over tens of thousands of dollars for a MS program when I already have a CS minor with several research experiences under my belt. A part of me feels like I should save money and just opt for a bootcamp.

Right now, I am leaning towards a masters just because of the thoroughness and reputability of MS programs relative to bootcamps, but I hope to hear other opinions.

Anyone here choose a CS masters over a bootcamp? Was it worth it? Any regrets?

On the other hand, did anyone choose a bootcamp over a CS masters? Was it comprehensive enough for you? What sorts of jobs do you qualify for? Are you equipped to work in SWE or ML engineer roles? Any regrets?

I'm a young professional (21), just been in this job for one year, and I have A LOT to learn. I love what I do, and I do believe that's my main remarkable quality. But during this year, I have heard from multiple co-workers and superiors that I'm one of a kind, that I'm ""going places"", that I'm manager material, and even the manager himself has told my supervisor that I'm going to be a boss one day.  


I recently went through an interview for a promotion, conducted by 3 supervisors and the coordinator, and they were all very impressed by my resumé, and we talked a lot about the future, where they instructed me to pursue managerial education. Later on, I learned that no one has ever had an interview with so many ""boss figures"", and people say they were all very interested on my career.

One of these supervisors has already started assigning me important tasks which makes me think he deposits some level of trust on me. Thus I'm questioning if it's even a good thing to be constantly on the spotlight, and have everyone expect so much of you. I feel like any minor mistake would be my ruin, my death sentence in the company. Like ""it's all downhill from here on"".  

All this talk makes me extremely anxious, I'm always thinking about when the inevitable failure will come, and they will all say to each other ""What were we thinking? The kid is a loser"" and laugh and forget me and everything they had told me... I'd like to know how to deal with this pressure."

Good outfit to work so far, however the last two years have been very difficult with a lack of resources (supply chain, qualified personnel, business stagnant etc) to run production. I’ve effectively been doing 2-3 FT positions to keep the operation running, but have not seen a pay increase (I asked for one when we lost our only plant technician and I “filled” the job in May, did not receive more pay). I also fly and manage a corporate airplane for this same company, for the last 5 years. I’m home every night, albeit late.

I was just offered a position with a total compensation picture of \~150k, not including 401k and insurance. This is perhaps slightly lower than what I'd thought considering my experience, location, industry, niche skill set etc, but not out of line. However, my primary concern is that the base salary is 65k and the remainder is bonused, based on an estimation based of mine/the company's ability to hit performance metrics. Some of these metrics may not even be in my control.

I expected a portion of my compensation to be commission or bonus based, but nearly 2/3 seems skewed, especially since this is a small company and I don't know much about their track record. Additionally, sales are seasonal, the sales cycle is very long (\~12 months) so my bonuses would be irregular and could take time to materialize. 

I'm okay with the figure, but would like to ask to reduce the percentage of commission I make in exchange for an increased base, but my fear is that this will make me look ""lazy"" to the employer. How would you approach this in salary negotiations? Thank you."

Anyone out there know the main differences between the 2? I have heard a EE can do programming stuff easier than vice versa."
638,Should I accept this offer or keep interviewing?,careerguidance,"I’ve been working on transitioning into UX Research for a year and I have an offer on the table at the moment. I’d like advice on next steps. 

Offer: 
- pretty well-known company
- Research operations/support rather than actually doing the Research myself
- working directly under and with UX Researchers so lots of potential for learning and growth
- supportive culture and potential for upward mobility or transition into UX Research
- good manager 
- good pay and benefits
- permanently remote

They want me to make a decision on the offer quickly but they did say I could request an extension if needed.

——————————————————

I still have a lot of interviews lined up for this week.

Interviews I have lined up:

Company 2: Final round for a product role with a mission-oriented organization. Would be working on some really cool products but wouldn’t be focused on UX Research and I don’t know that the team would be supportive of a lateral move into that in the future. The work/products/mission would be the most interesting out of the companies I am considering. Not remote.

Company 3: Final round for a UX Research Operations and Strategy role at a less known company. My interactions with the team have not been as positive so far. I don’t know whether there would be support to transition into doing UX Research.

Company 4: Potentially a final round for a UX Researcher role at a well-known company. They have been very unreliable about responding/scheduling even though they told me they want to move forward. Not remote.

——————————————————

Questions: 

Should I accept the offer and stop interviewing/looking elsewhere or should I try to get multiple offers to decide between?

Will i potentially lose the offer if I request an extension?

Would I be doing myself a disservice by not getting a job directly within UX Research immediately? Or would hiring managers see a UX Research support/operations role as good experience for transitioning into a UX Research role in the future? 

Should I send the offer letter to the other companies i am interviewing with?

——————————————————

Also, for what it is worth, I will be doing continued learning outside of work to supplement what I learn on the job. I will be trying to get an accredited certificate in UX research while working full-time."

650,Change in executive sponsorship - how to navigate next steps?,careerguidance,"So I have worked for small businesses over the past 6-8 years (50-500 people), ranging from 25M to 200M in annual revenue. My experience has been to enter these companies and establish data teams from the ground up, that facilitate reporting, insights, automation, and forecasting for sales, finance, product, and operations. These smaller companies are somewhat volatile, as my average tenure ranges from 1-3 years, most of the time for factors outside of my control. FWIW, prior to my BI career, I was a finance director.

This most recent stint has been with another small software company with approximately 35M in revenue and 152 employees. My annual BI spend is budgeted at 30K/ year, and goes towards Fivetran, BigQuery, and Sigma. I have been with the company for 7 months. I’ve made presentations to our executive leadership team, to the private equity group, and to department leaders.

This last Thursday, our CFO and my boss was terminated immediately from the company. She sponsored my position in order to facilitate future due diligence cycles since our customer data is in shambles. I’ve also established a cross functional data governance committee to address these issues.

That former CFO called me that night to explain it came out of nowhere and that she would be a reference for me if I so decided to move on.

My concern comes from the immediacy of the CFOs departure. My understanding is that she was performing well and the department was progressing. The CFO was replaced with someone the next day who has stated they don’t typically hire people for BI. I’m sensing a lot of red flags.

I’ve since updated my resume and started applying to director roles. Besides enduring the situation while searching for a better leadership opportunity, what else should be done? I have no issue selling the BI philosophy to the CFO, it just seems they’re viewing BI as a luxury at this stage of the company.

653,Should I leave my job after only being there for a few months?,careerguidance,"I've been at my first job since finishing university for around 4 months now. I'm doing well &amp; already have a lot of responsibility which is great. 

Unfortunately, I don't like the location that I'm based at; it's a relatively quiet town with not much to do. I already knew this prior to accepting the job, but I didn't think it would be such a problem, but it is. 

If I start applying for other jobs (based in London), will the fact that I've only been at my current role for 4 months be a red flag? 

I have two options:

(1) Try my luck &amp; start looking for a good role based in London now.
Or 
(2) Wait until I get an internal promotion at my current job &amp; gain more experience, and then apply for a role in London"
654,Self employed 3D artist...where do I go from here?,careerguidance,"Hi all, I've spent the last 8 months of my life on a passion project to sell 3D modeled anime girls. Unfortunately I suck ass at business and ruined my dream because I'm too shy &amp; comfortable with the term ""I'll do it later"" 

My heart is absolutely broken and torn - I really thought I could do it...but there's just something wrong with me I guess. 

I was working in IT (HelpDesk) before this. I hated it so so much. I'm heavily introvert and it's exhausting every single day.. I need to find a new job, and I swore I wouldn't return to this godawful field, but I need money and most others just don't fit the bills. 

I still desperately want to do my own business and will keep trying but how can I look for a job when I literally couldn't give a shit about it? Are there any crossover fields? I've been looking for HelpDesk jobs with gaming companies but it's really hard to find that. 

I just want to art and create... sorry I'm a mess. 

I guess TLDR; I'm an experienced help desk person/artist who needs to go back into a field I hate (IT) to pay the bills. Are there any jobs I can be creative in? Even better jobs in 3D? I don't have a good enough portfolio for an actual job in 3D."

656,Anyone able to give me some guidance?,careerguidance,"I am a 23yo living in Calgary, Canada with my GF of 7.5 years. I recently got a job with a 90k salary and 30-50k bonus (investment banking). My GF has 1.5 years left of Vet school and then she will be making over 100k after she graduates. We recently bought a house and have about 50k in equity and a 450k mortgage with a 5 year fixed at 1.8%. We have about $40k in the stock market. Our total combined living expenses not including the equity portion of the mortgage are about $2500-$3000 a month and we feel like we can maintain this level of living expenses for as long as we want with the occasional bigger expense (vacation, car repairs, etc). 

The thing is, I hate my new job. I thought it was what I wanted to do when I got the job but since I’ve started I realize I find no enjoyment in the work/career path that could come from it. I work 12+ hours a day in an extremely intense, high pressure environment and I have been giving barely any training. Every time I ask my boss questions he gives me these condescending looks like I’m an idiot and either says “figure it out” or tries to explain but does a very poor job. I am usually a very chill and mentally tough guy but this is driving my anxiety through the roof. 

I have been looking to switch into a career with a more fulfilling and exciting role with WLB and flexibility in my schedule and have some potential opportunities. The issue is I would be taking a 50% pay cut although I’d be working almost 50% less hours too. With my extra free time I can actually enjoy my life plus work on a side hustle  to bring in extra income with the goal to eventually make enough just from that. Also forgot to mention we have about $45k in cash but are looking to deploy that now that we are settled into our house.

In about 4 years we want to travel the world. I know that will cost a good chunk of money but totally worth it IMO. After the 2 years, my GF will go back to working as a vet making over $100k but the vet industry is known for its burn out and turnover rates.

Lastly, I don’t like to think about this or bank on this but I will likely get a very sizeable inheritance from my grandparents/parents in 30-35 years (~$1m in todays dollars but will go down based on how much they spend and go up based on how much their investments go up).

The question to everyone is:

1. Do you have any general advice for either of us going forward?
2. What would you do in my position with my current job/opportunities?
3. If we both want to basically coast or baristaFIRE by age 30 where she can work as a part time vet and I can work a flexible fulfilling job, with a combined income of atleast 100k, is that possible and sustainable? We also want to be able to travel a lot and have kids in our mid 30s? I believe we could get by on about 40-50k a year plus however much kids cost when we have them.

The problem is my new job is not what I expected. The work hours are extremely long and I am man enough to admit my mind is not sharp enough to be plugged in 12 hours a day 5/6 days a week. My new job dropped me in the deep in taking over and finishing 2 large projects without hardly knowing any of their procedures. I mean it is a trainwreck everyday and I feel stupid because I’m ultimately responsible. Construction management is fun but I have grown to hate not being able to be on autopilot for even one day.

I am debating whether I should repeat a year focusing on JEE and try to get a circuital branch or CSE in one of the top five IITs or continue my present course.

I want to be a successful entrepreneur or real-estate investor 20 years down the line and I'm confused as to what the better path for me will be. I hope to attend a top 10 Ivy League college for a master's degree after my BTech to support me in my endeavour.

670,Wanting to transition out of retail management and into something more lucrative- how do you determine if a sales position is beneficial?,careerguidance,"I always see listings for sales positions with pay scales that don’t seem honest- “up to 150k”. I realize that the top performers could theoretically earn more via commissions and bonuses, but I’m trying to be realistic when I look at these offers.

How do you determine what positions will be lucrative? What questions do you ask? 

I’ve always been salaried, and the idea of working a position where the income isn’t solidified is terrifying."
671,What do my Qualifications and Experience say about me?,careerguidance,"Basically just a brief rundown of my background and current/future resume.

So to start with I have a learning disability, not one that requires massive accommodation, but on the level where I have difficulty with social interactions and more require a level of understanding from those around me ( I'm in Canada so the discrimination against people with disabilities is very subtle due to robust human rights laws). I feel that this has put me in a position where I have hit a glass ceiling where I can not gain more relevant experience. 

My current and future qualifications (within the next 2-3 years) are:

\- 3rd class power engineer (current, maybe get my 2nd but undecided)

\- 10 years as a process operator at an oil refinery

\- Occupational Health and Safety Diploma (finishing this summer) that will allow me to become a CRSP ( Canadian Registered Safety Professional).

 \-  Two, Professional Management certificates: specialties in Risk and Strategic management (I'll be done those around the end of this year)

\- BBA in Applied Management ( spring 2024 completion)

&amp;#x200B;

So what I am asking is that due to my inability to gain any relevant experience (I do have 10 years of experience just not in the roles I would want), would my stack of certifications make up for that difference, taking into account the nature of my disability (which I try to disclose in a way to fulfill diversity points). Am I on the right track or at nearly 30 years old is this a futile exercise of being able to put some letters behind my name?"
672,Existencial crisis. How can I narrow down my choices???,careerguidance," 

Hi! I am in an existential crisis kind of moment in my life(I turn 39 in feb). I feel like my life is going nowhere. I work as a waiter and have been for the past 10 years. I make good money, more than most people around me on trade jobs etc. I feel like there's no way to go there. I am running through the motions, I work 3 to 4 days a week and make a comfortable living but absolutely hate the restaurant life working late, weekends etc. The job offers NO mental challenge of any kind. I love to build and create things.

So far I have considered 3 options:

1. Youtuber. Kind of a pipe dream but I really want it and I have tried twice and stopped short at the fault stage. I would love to live off of making and editing videos! No guarantee of any income whatsoever but this has a huge ceiling which I like as an entrepreneur.
2. Electromechanic or electronic related field. This is something that I've enjoyed since I was a teenager. I was introduced by a neighbor and have enjoyed it since. I believe that to make really good money I need to own a shop or work for a pharmaceutical company. Making good money is important in my book. This requires me to study anywhere from 2 to 4 years.
3. WELDER - another job that I love to do. Pay would be same or maybe less than now working 40hrs/w instead of 20 to 28. This would take me 24 weeks of classes(once per week.

What do you suggest I can do to narrow this further??"

I started exploring Machine Learning because I started seeing it everywhere and I've been loving it. I have been learning ML daily for 8 hours since the past week and I've been thoroughly enjoying it!

However, for some dumb reason, I feel guilty about being indecisive. I did Web Dev and really enjoyed it, but it no longer excites me like it did in the beginning.

Has this happened to anyone? What would you do if you were in my place? Plus I've heard ML engineers are paid better than web developers, and I'd love to be able to earn well to support my parents.

Hello! As the title states, I am a current nursing student who has the intentions of withdrawing. I’m 28 years old currently with a background working full time as a firefighter and paramedic. Been doing this for about 6 years now. I thought I wanted to bridge to my nursing for a better quality of life and hours along with better pay. I worked while doing all the prerequisites and entrance exam. I succeeded and got into a program that only requires once a week attendance. It takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to get to school. 

To make this short. I like medicine and nursing is not that. I hate studying the nursing material and I don’t think I can do this for a whole year and half. I want to back out but don’t know what to do. 

I thought about cybersecurity and computer science but I have zero background in IT and I don’t have a degree. I’m also not young and I would be in my 30s the time I graduate.

I have tried googling numerous articles but they all repeat the same thing again and again. I'm afraid I'm missing out many things which I have no idea about.
So I wanted to know What are some high demand skills that don’t require college that I can teach myself online and get a high or even good paying job? Or I can freelance to make a good amount of money? I am ready to work hard and plan on becoming an expert on one skill I pick.
Many recommended programming and I know there's so much potential but with no CS degree and extreme competition in this sector I'm afraid it will be very difficult for me. Also, I don't think I'm smart enough for this.
So, kindly suggest me some career options which can I pursue. As I have no interest in any particular sector, I will research them all and try them out. 
I want to set a goal for myself and work hard to achieve that I promise.

694,Should I quit my future career?,careerguidance,"Need help, insufferable tutor in the way of my career

I’m not sure if this is the right place, but here goes.

Long story short, I’m in engineering. I’m currently a few weeks away from getting the qualifications I’ve been working for that’ll help me in life.

However, the whole process has been exhausting mentally and now physically. 

To add, I just entered my 20s.

The course started academically in a shabby rented room with less than a dozen students. It has only just now become physical with on site work 

It was fun to begin with and I enjoyed it. The other students are all ages and they are generally really nice and I’ve got on with them really well. 

But the teacher is another ordeal.

At the start he was nice, a figure id look up to. But he soon became short tempered and a whole load of incidents occurred.

At one point it was just me and him in a class and I was struggling to solve a problem.  

He proclaimed “you are not leaving here till you solve this.”, after looking at me like I was a simpleton for a good ten minutes and shouting in my face. It’s been a while since then, but I remember how uncomfortable and upsetting it was. I’m not a sensitive person but the tone of his voice was pretty violent. Why would you shout so loud in an empty class when I was right by him?

There was another moment he threw a pen in my face at point blank range in a full class, because another student took my pen from my book and I was to blame for it. 

Unless I do things on the spot, or get it right first time, I get lectured and given sarcastic remarks. 

The other students don’t experience this. Maybe because I’m a soft spoken, young, polite teenager willing to learn a trade that he feels that he has power over me. The other guys are hard and rugged, or just much older. 

Recently it has become more physical the course and I was looking forward to it, until I couldn’t keep up physically with the others who are built like giants. Which earned me a few berating remarks.

This was after an hour of hard work and a few weeks suffering with Covid. Of course I couldn’t keep up, my lungs are wrecked 

What annoys me is that there’s a student who rarely comes in, my age, who gets a completely different treatment. He has good grades and a sharp mind, something which the Tutor goes on about. 

I don’t have good grades, but does that make me any more worthless?

He treats him like the son he cares about, talking about their shared passions and being understanding. 

This student has an awful attendance rate and was NOT there for the physical work. Which he needed to attend.

However I have a feeling he won’t be berated for that.

I must mention I have a 100% attendance rate and try my best to be understanding.

While my career might not be with this man forever, I am seriously stressed and feeling down. I feel like I am not given basic respect and that I’m a stupid kid who should just leave.

I’ve felt this my whole life and feeling it with a bunch of strangers just hurts.

I’m inclined to just take the qualifications and leave it as a career.

English isn’t my first language so I apologise."

I’ve applied at most of the places in my town that will accept high school students. My resume looks pretty good for my first time writing one, according to my friends that have jobs, so I don’t really think it’s that but it very well could be. Also for a little bit of info on where I live, I live in a town that has a little over 6000 people and the closest major city is about three hours away. The closest “city” to me is an hour away and I don’t have a car so I can’t drive there or get anyone to drive me there. Also this town is very conservative and I do not look the part. However, some of the employees I’ve seen, and know, do not look the part but still got the job.

I’ve applied at McDonald’s as a part time crew member three times and no response. I’ve applied at subway twice but I recently applied again so I could get a call soon. I’ve applied at mr mikes for a dishwasher position and got no response. I’ve applied at wholesale club (its a grocery store) as a grocery clerk three times, no response. I’ve applied at pet valu once because they had a part time position, no response. I’ve applied at red apple (discount store), no response. I’ve applied at marry brown’s (fast food), no response. I started handing out resumes and filling out applications online since the start of November and I have got no word on any of the jobs I’ve applied for. 

Like it hurts knowing that not even McDonald’s or subway wont call me for an interview. 

Any advice would be very helpful because I’m seriously thinking of packing up all of my stuff and moving in with a friend that lives in the major city so I can have more job options and opportunities because this town sucks."

I'm at a tough choice in my career. I switched industries from an unrelated position, to a networking infrastructure technician apprenticeship. 

I am now at the end of the apprenticeship and I was offered a position of the tech lead for a business, but it only pays £25,000, there are no progression opportunities and despite the job title, this is pretty much just 1st and 2nd line support, while taking blame for everything that goes wrong.

On the other hand, I can do a next level apprenticeship in cyber security, which offers the same pay. There will be good opportunities after that apprenticeship and it won't be a dead end. 

That being said, I'm not sure if I'm interested enough in cyber sec to pursue it with passion. The reason for starting the infrastructure technician apprenticeship was to transition to cyber security, but during the apprenticeship I learned more about the subject of network security and it's not as fun in real life as it sounds before you learn the details.

719,Which job should I choose?,careerguidance,"This is my first time posting on Reddit, so forgive me for being a noob. I’d love to hear others feedback on the decision I’m facing right now between two jobs.

Bio - M, 26yo, CFP and CFA designations, location: British Columbia, married, no kids but hoping to start a family soon.

Job 1 - my current role as a financial planner. I’ve been working for this small, independent firm since I graduated 4 years ago. I love this place and the people I work with. Our main business is working with middle income families on everything from budgeting to estate planning to tax planning and of course investment and retirement planning as well. I used to work in the office but since we moved to BC I’ve been completely remote. The remote work situation is working fine, but I do sometimes miss the office camaraderie. I’m mostly a paraplanner for another advisor in the office because I suck at bringing in my own clients (only about ~$5M AUM personally). Long term, the advisor I work for is looking for a successor and has told me he wants me to fill that role if I wanted to. One of the biggest benefits to this job is the flexibility. If I have an appointment or something going on during the day, I can just work later or work more the next day as long as I get my stuff done. We really don’t keep track of vacation as long as no one abuses it. Both my family and my wife’s lives a ways away and we have the freedom to go and visit them because I can just work from there. Getting paid about $115k CAD annually all guaranteed. Steady wage growth each year around 10-15% raises.

Job 2 - the job I’m currently being offered. The role is with a real estate investment firm as an analyst. Since I have my CFA, the hope would be that I would advance to a “portfolio manager” role rather quickly. I’d be back in an office setting, with a typical 8-5pm schedule. 4 weeks vacation plus holidays, and $100k base plus 15% bonus potential. Possibility of $200k base within 5 years. The role would be more analytical in nature and I would finally be able to use the CFA designation that I worked so hard for. One of the biggest draws for me with this job is that it’s local and I could get back to being connected with a business and a group of coworkers that live around here since my wife and I just moved and we don’t know a lot of people yet."

724,Is it too soon to ask for a raise / re-evaluate salary?,careerguidance,"I started a new job in October that is perfect for me and my career. Before this, I was working at a non-profit, making very little money and stressed financially and for my career. I got the interview for my now job through LinkedIn and was given very little notice so I did my basic company and role research. I am used to full-time, permanent roles going through multiple rounds of interviews and not discussing salary until later rounds. In my interview, they asked what my salary expectations were, unfortunately I was not prepared / just really wanted to have a new job so I said 50-60k. Usually I prefer to be the one to ask about salary but alas. 

Anyways, I was offered the job and requested to start ASAP since the previous person had left over a month before and some mat leaves were coming up, so the team really needed someone to hit the ground running. I was offered 57k with a 5k annual bonus. After I got the offer, I regretted not being more prepared with a wider salary expectation range and a higher ask. I was able to negotiate my benefits but I didn't try to negotiate salary since they had offered me more than what I had initially requested. 

Next week will mark my 3 months with the company and I have received lots of positive feedback from the execs about my performance and addition to the team (the company is very small).  I have been given lots of responsibilities and definitely hit the ground running and am now hoping that with proving myself and my worth, I may be able to improve my salary. 

I am considering reaching out to the person who was previously in my role via LinkedIn and asking if they are comfortable sharing the salary range they received in the role. Would that be too weird? It is so frustrating the lack of salary clarity in the world. Should I just request a meeting with the execs to check in with my 3 month milestone and then ask out of curiousity if I am receiving a comparable compensation to the previous person?

For the last 4 years I’ve worked a simple but good position in the biggest bank in the country, the pay is ok but the benefits are good. I realized I have been settling and stuck and decided to see what else is out there, so now I’m in the final stages of applying for a position with an international company (it’s fully remote which is how this is possible). Because the company is American, today when scheduling a zoom interview they’ve also asked me for three references. I’m kind of terrified. 
My only options are my current job and an internship in college, but even if I go for the internship references, I’ll still need one for my current job. 
My question is: how do I ask/warn my current supervisor about this? If I tell them it’s for a scholarship in a fancy online course, is it likely the person who contacts them will tell them the truth? Can I get away with asking for a friend to pretend to have been my boss?

727,Considering consulting or a phD?,careerguidance,"22. I know I will switch sooner rather than later from my current engineering position which I've been &lt;1 year. Because I am ambitious and I can and should look for other opportunities, leading to more growth, accomplishments and money. Also, I would want to find another location that's closer to a larger/wealthier city similar to places I grew up. 

My issue is I don't have any outstanding interests. I have brains and smart but do not like studying. So to play to this I could go back to school and get a terminal degree like a phD and ride a profession such as a professor (since I have experience/am good at tutoring or explaining concepts) building up experience and expertise in one area can help me be successful. The other option was to enter a consulting/analyst role because what I majored in fits into it, and it is, in my opinion, one where I'll be pushed and learn a lot, and the money isn't bad. I fit into the analytical/calculating side of it, but not as much the people oriented part of it, so playing to my strengths may be using my brain getting a terminal degree in school. (Or I can try that for a few years before deciding to go back to school.) I don't think I would ""enjoy"" any of this work but if it pushes me in the right ways and uses my strengths and sets me up in a healthy direction that I ask for. 

At the very least I should start figuring out where I want to *focus in depth* as my career/life is asking for that to be defined."

739,New Job: WFH or Move to Physical office?,careerguidance,"So I recently applied to move up in my organization. I was selected for the job and now have a decision: i can work full telework (have to stay within a 500 mile radius) or relocate 2.5hrs to work in the office with a relocation incentive to do so. 

I know my employer strongly prefers me to be there physically. He is an old school kind of guy but knew he had to give the virtual option to get a good pool. He will let me choose, but I know he wants me there. This job is a stepping stone for me so I plan to use it to climb the ladder. 

On the opposite end, I personally have come to really like working at home. My current job was WFH during the pandemic and now starting to shuffle people back to the office again. I live about 3hrs away so I would have to sell my house and get an apartment. They will pay for the move, but it would impact my personal life a good bit. My GF is pretty cemented in the area and would have a hard time coming with me. We do not live together either so it would perhaps hasten that step in our relationship. She does have kids as well to factor in there. My parents are older and not as well to top that off.

TL;DR - my career would benefit moving to physically be in the office, but my personal life benefits from taking the job virtually.

741,How should I negotiate my salary expectations?,careerguidance,"I'm an early career lab research technician. I've received an offer at a new institution that I'm very excited about, but the current salary offer is too low for my current financial needs. They're open to negotiating, but I've never actually negotiated salary before. How do I know how much more is reasonable to ask? Should I just research the average salary of similar jobs in the particular city that I'm in, and ask for slightly more than what I actually would like (so that if they try to bring it down, it will still be reasonable close to my actual expectation)?"

743,"Resigned for a better paying job and I regret it, should I ask for my old job back?",careerguidance,"I am feeling the regret really hard right now. I recently left my permanent job of 12 years for a better paying “1 year contract likely to be renewed” position. I signed the contract under the impression that I would be receiving comprehensive health benefits (as this is what the agreement they sent me said before I signed) and now they are reversing their stance and NOT providing me with benefits for the duration of my year long probation. I am distraught as I have been in multiple accidents and benefit coverage is essential to my health and well-being. I also think it’s in really poor taste and don’t know if this is who I want to work for. Doesn’t seem like they are willing to negotiate.

It’s also dawning on me that I left a permanent position for a “1 year and we’ll review to see if we want to hire you back” job, despite the 10,000/yr raise. I should have taken more time to assess.

The good news is I spoke to my previous manager two days ago before I learned of this and she told me it’s not too late to take back my job. We have a great relationship. I called her today to gauge if I can return, but she’s away from office until Monday.

How should I go about trying to secure my old job again? Has anyone experienced the same… did you return the same position/pay? I’ve only resigned two weeks ago.

744,Underqualified for jobs that are similar to what I was fired from and unsure what to search for?,careerguidance,"I was fired last summer for missing work due to a medical issue.

In my last position I built ad hoc reporting for a mortgage company's accounts payable/claims departments.  I'm very good with Excel (pivot tables/formulas/some VBA) and Teradata (ANSI SQL). I have a some credits towards a degree in data analytics, but this is on hold until I can find work again.

I'm having a much harder time finding a job than I thought I would, or even getting interviews for that matter. I've mostly been applying for data analyst roles to no success. I'm assuming this is because nearly all positions in this field call for a bachelor's degree, which I don't have.

749,Should I say yes to an interview if I've already accepted another offer?,careerguidance,"I applied for a job with my city's department of public health, which apparently is going through a mass expedited hiring process now. Last week I had four 20-min, recorded and strictly scripted interviews for the same position at different programs. I was offered a job by one of them today, and the hiring manager gave me a very tight turnaround to respond by 4pm PST. I said yes bc it's a better paying job, better benefits, I'd get more prof development and training, and I'd be working with a population I enjoy. He also told me that if I didn't respond by then HR would probably make him move onto the next candidate. My only reluctance with it is that the hours can be kind of all over the place. Up to twice a month I might be asked to do overnight shifts, and my schedule can be shifted the week-of if there was an emergent need. Not a huge fan of that but I am getting bored with my current job so perhaps this will keep it interesting. I'd also be expected to commute to the office 4-5x/week, which is very different than my current WFH unless I have an appt with someone set-up. Anyway, at 3:59pm PST I got ANOTHER email from yet another program within the dept asking if I would be interested in an interview. I don't know how different this job is, but if there's a chance it were a little more structured/less intense, I think I'd jump for it. I also have intense FOMO so I always struggling with feeling like I made the right choice lol. I don't want to burn the bridge I've barely built, but is it worth it to go for the interview at the other program??"

I think I'm due for a promotion, but my manager and I haven't discussed it. Other than him mentioning the company doesn't do raises during our review. I still got a cost of living increase, but not really comparable to what I've done.

She was responsible for a small team of 4 people with whom I worked with often and our projects overlapped frequently.  My boss told me of her putting in notice and that he is working on finalizing the job description for the role that will replace her (scope will change a little bit).  When he was discussing it, he made comments that made it clear that the job will be posted but that I should apply.  I am now confused.  If he thinks I might be a good candidate for this higher level role, why not automatically promote me rather than having me apply?  Anyone else had to apply for their promotion?

752,[A CRUD TON OF READING BUT I NEED HELP] I am a lifeless uneducated and clueless 17 year old that just got into their first choice college - but now I have to pick a major?!,careerguidance,"Knowledge I want you to know about me - I am 17 and very clueless as to how the working world works and that's why I'm looking for advice. **I have no interest in college beyond a bachelor's degree, feel free to inform me if any of them would only get me good jobs through a higher degree.** I have no idea how anything works and am incredibly new to the idea of living independently. I've lived quite sheltered. I like careers that involve helping people, feeling rewarded, and doing something that makes me feel like I'm not a snake. 

My strenghts - I pride myself off of my vocabulary, I try to be empathetic, I have a lot of determination. I love to help others, and expand my view on the world

My weaknesses - I pickup a defeatist attitude when I feel helpless, I can be a doormat, I lack patience, I'm bad at math and I can get a real nasty attitude regarding education when I hate what I'm learning about. I also am kind of oblivious and I can say rude things out of bluntness. 

Sooo to start off, I'm not asking you to pick a major for me. I'm just going to list the ones i saw on all of the majors offered that I thought were interesting, and I want your opinion keeping in mind these three criterion:

1. Pay - I'm looking for above 50k-60k, and while I've been introduced to this idea of a ""career ladder"" i want to graduate and start working with a comfortable wage.

2. Opportunity - I dont want to have few career options I really want to have choices and a flexible path because I'm kind of indecisive and a bit of a worry-wart 

3. Difficulty - I'm kind of stupid and I'm horrible with math. But I'm currently testing to see if it's just garbage work ethic or poor approach to learning that holds me back. But I don't want something that's super hard or a cake walk. I want to pursue a career that will make me proud of myself but not stress me out so much that a migraine is just like a daily occurrence

Ok sorry if that was a lot, thanks for hanging in there, here were my choices with brief explanations

1. Animal Behavior - I love animals so much and literally every animal is cool or cute to me, I love them all and my school of choice doesn't call it zoology they call it animal behavior 

2. Cognitive Science - I like this one because I love the poetic art of speech and writing, philosophy, and  psychology but I also wanted something multidisciplinary for more opportunity and I've also heard psychology isn't as worth it, and college is expensive asf so if it's not worth it I'm not bothering 

3. Epidemiology - Research jobs interest me because it's so easy for me to engulf myself in a topic I really really love and every time I've written a research paper I'd be so proud of my final product and that fell so good. So don't get creeped out but I think infections are so cool and when I was like 8 I would get infections on accident but then love to touch them...anyway, diseases are so cool and orginizations/hospitals all around the U.S. need people with these skills. 

4. Microbiology - I love life it's so beautiful and this is where it all starts. Life is just fascinating to me and this field of study seems so inspiring. Like that's where it all begins, those little guys. Also that microbe game from rhythm heaven was fun. 

5. Marketing - So I had a goal to include one business/econ/finance major cause that's what everyone says will make you money. But I don't like the idea of being a business man because it feels ethically wrong to me for some reason. Anyways I loved to make adverts for my school projects when they let us pick what to make and I'm like so creative so this looked like the most approachable one within that world of business and stuff. I'd love to do social media marketing or something. 

So those are the 5 I thought were good choices based on my criterion, now I'm gonna see what you have to say about those 5 choices based on the same criterion. Then ill have my opinion and like a bunch of opinions to compare ideas and help to **inform** (not make, but inform) my decision! 

Thank you so much for reading all of this I really appreciate the advice and I'll take every bit of it I can get it :^D"

756,Advice for a Business Information Systems major?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I am a senior majoring in business information systems. I'm graduating in the spring with some Analyst experience from working as an intern at the university for one of its tech centers (11 months). I'm having a lot of trouble landing interviews, my GPA isn't stellar (3.28 currently but I am studying so I can end my last two terms with A's to bump it up). Currently I am pursuing a Data Analytics Certificate offered by coursera in addition to school with an expected completion date of end of February. This course ends with a capstone project which I can add on my resume. I know the job search is expected to be hard but I didn't expect so many no's. It seems like a lot of analyst roles also hire CS majors so I think it's hard to compete with them. What I'm wondering is take a 5th year and potentially grind out a CS minor or just graduate on time while doing what I'm doing and keep on cold applying. The fear of entering the real world has slowly crept in and honestly I'm terrified of not getting a job out of college. Any advice?

Thanks,

A worried senior :/"

760,27M: Could you answer a few questions about PR as a career for me?,careerguidance," 

Hello.

It is unfortunate of me to say, but I was suspended from my optometry program.  With this in mind, I was looking at possibly banking on my old undergrad major of public relations.  I enjoyed the creativity and writing aspect of the job, so I think I might be decent in the profession.  However, I do have a few questions for those who are  already in the career:

\-Would you recommend the field of public relations to somebody right now?

\-If one was to return to the world of public relations after doing other things for a time, how should one go about it to re-establish credentials and competency?

\-Would you recommend one do a masters in public relations to move up in the job?

\-If so, where do you recommend one does a masters in public relations: a respected institution, online or does it really matter?

\-What does a masters in public relations entail when it comes to coursework?

\-If  job experience is needed, does the initial internship / task matter for the position one wants? Also, is there a difference in respect between a  remote vs an in-person internship / task?

\-Is it easy to do the transition from public relations into marketing?

\-If one wants to practice in a different state (I live in Texas, but want to move back to Southern California to take care of my parents), should I  establish roots in Southern California when it concerns job experience and / or a masters over Texas?

Thank you very much.  I apologize that these are a lot of questions overall."

Lately I have been sensing my director being fed up by me and I don’t understand how to go about it. 

It happened a couple times that a question I asked on the broader group chat wasn’t addressed or that he replied quite harshly to something I asked, making me feel stupid even though it was something that no one explained to me before.

I’m not as good as those with the resources and experience in multi-person marketing agencies, but i’m good.

i have two clients— one of them I gained around mid-december. this client was promising at first— standard pay and more hours than my other client, seemed communicative, and agreed to my social media plan. his business did not have tiktok or insta before i met him.

Flashforward to now: he is not being communicative, he wants me to manage one more social account even though we agreed to two of his businesses, and i have to bug him incessantly to give me account permissions, reviewing FB connections, etc. His tone with me sometimes isn’t appreciated (ex: he asks me for the insta password, I tell him that I gave it to him via text and via the social media masterlist of users and passwords multiple times, and he says “hey hey hey, be patient with me.”) Sometimes he won’t look at my emails and he says it’s because of it being peak tax season and that he doesn’t have te time

I’m an independent contractor working remotely for him, but i’m considering quitting before getting back and going on payroll/part-time.

I feel like what I want is financial stability and I am thinking about pursuing a trade/apprenticeship type job. It would be more cost efficient and quicker than a four year degree which may not even guarantee a job.

I wouldn't mind reconsidering a college degree after I have become more financially independent and know what I want from an education.

So basically I don’t like my current job. It’s comfortable enough, first job out of college, good name, i like my team. Hate the role itself, feel like I’m learning not much relevant and don’t see how it’s relevant to where I want to be career wise. 

Just got a new job that I’m so excited about, pay would be higher but realistically the commute would render it equal. I would have to pay back my signing bonus at my first firm which is about 6700 post taxes. But this is a firm I can really see myself at in the field I want to be. I would have to leave my current job at the six and a half month mark. It’s gonna suck telling my manager and I don’t really know how to do so. But I know if I don’t take it I’m always gonna regret it and hate myself. Push me in the right direction Reddit?

TLDR: 
Pros of taking new job: 
-Love the company
-the role is what I want to do, puts me on career track I want to be on as opposed to the one I’m on now 
-higher base pay 

Cons of taking new job: 
-have to leave my first job at six and a half months

I applied for a role on LinkedIn (IT Manager, Easy Apply) that was posted by a staffing agency (think Brook Source, Randstad,...)

Applied on Monday, phone screen with recruiter Tuesday, and 2x 30 minute Teams interviews Friday (today) with the future bosses, Director and Sr. Director.

Just now received the offer and it all looks as promised! Offer is a **3 month Contract-to-Hire for an IT Manager** with the intention to convert to w-2 permanent employee after.

Both Director's both said the prior Manager was a permanent employee but left for a competitor promotion and they could hire his replacement faster if they did C2H instead of starting perm. Everyone on the 10-person team is a permanent employee and my future-boss said he still has headcount to convert the role so.

My current employer said they're wanting me to be a ""temp manager"" while they find someone better and then will cut me after 90 days.

$60,500 - $64,500 and was 0-10% of the salary scale and you would be paid based on qualifications and experience and requires 2 years experience minimum. 

The actual salary range for the position is $60,500 - $96,000 and the previous person who worked their made around $82k per year (also with a masters). Nothing bad they were just transferred to another city into another position at their request.

The application portal didn’t allow me to continue unless I gave my current salary ($59,055). 

I researched around and asked some professional colleagues at other companies at the type type of position and of the same size how much they are paid and it ranged from $79,000 - $89,000. While my researched shows for my skills and qualifications my market value is $75k. I should mention they also have a masters while I have a bachelors. 

I was thinking since they know my actual salary at the moment at this point. I would like a salary of $75k - 80k. And I’m told they always ask in the interview for your expected salary. 

The position requires 2 years minimum and I have 6 years experience. The more senior position a salary grade above this position requires a license and 5 years of experience and starts at $70,500 and maxes out at $110,000k

I’m asking for this salary because that is what I would take to afford the cost of living in my City, what my colleagues at other companies are also paid, my experience and expected inflation for the remainder of the year. 

Does my asking salary seem reasonable? If not what would be?"
785,"I (and my coworkers) have not received a bonus this year, but I earned a very large pay raise. Should I be frustrated or content?",careerguidance,"Alright, I hope this doesn't come off as entitled, as that's not my intent. I, like everyone else in the world, wants to make good pay and this post is just me looking for perspective on that.

To keep this simple and short, after working very hard last year I was able to negotiate a large pay raise (~20%) around the end of September. I'm quite happy with this salary and it is definitely worth the work I am putting out. However, I have not received a bonus for 2021, which we have historically gotten. None of my coworkers have gotten one either and there has been no communication from the owner on this matter. While I would love a bonus and certainly think I've earned one, I feel a little bad prodding for one due to the substantial raise I already received. I'm trying to decide what to do, whether to bring it up casually, or to just let it go and be happy with what I have. The nature of bonuses is in the name, they are bonuses, and not a guaranteed thing. What would you do? Would you feel a little burnt and move on, or would you push the issue further?"
786,Do I stick with a well-paying job or get out while the getting's good?,careerguidance,"My current position:

* Pays me way more than I can likely get anywhere else (53k for remote video production)
* Insurance is 300 per month out of my paycheck, no other benefits (no 401k, etc)
* Work is slow, assignments are super easy.
* Management is absolutely crazy, in a tolerable way. I honestly think it might be a money laundering scheme. The company most certainly will NOT be around forever.
* Low effort for high reward. I spend mots of my worktime pursuing my passion projects and honing my craft (or sometimes just going to the gym and having lunch with family)

I know that the downfall of this company is imminent because its so poorly managed. Plus, I do find it mentally taxing to spend so much time contributing to a totally useless product. I am type A, and like feeling as though I am making a difference.

On the other hand, I don't like the idea of getting a new job with new expectations, where I will probably be paid less, to do more work, for a product that I still won't be passionate about. I am currently biding my time waiting to invest in real estate so I can eventually not do the 40-hour grind, and free myself up to pursue creative filmmaking in a real capacity.

I am also... Petrified to fail.. like, not sleeping, full on panic attacks, the whole nine yards. But every morning I will get out of bed and go to work. 

My current job is very.. meh.. Salary is really good and benefits are 10/10. I work from home fulltime.. and get all my work done in aprox 20h a week. But my boss is the most incompetent man I have ever encountered, and I can't keep the look of my face when he fails in the most basic tasks. And the contents of my job aren't very challenging nor interesting.

Now.. I have been offered a leadership role in a smallish tech company. Its in an industry I LOVE.. But its in a specialty I don't have any experience with. My team will be super smart people, who will know infinitly more about the subject matter. They choose me for the job, because I have a good strategic business sense and have informally coached people (who were in my specialty) before with great succes.  It is going to be a real challenge. And seriously difficult to do well. I will be one of the 5 women to work there out of 60 people. I am going to be way out of my depth, at least the first year if not longer.  I already get nervous thinking about it. But it is an amazing career opportunity, and a rather unique one at that. If I have this on my resume for a couple of years, I will most likely not have trouble finding a job again. Pay is amazing, benefits are... meh.. But they did immediately offered me a fixed contract. Which means they can't fire me, unless a judge says they have legal grounds to do so, like proven underperformance. So firing will be harder, but if they want to it will get seriously messy. 

I am also just starting IVF.. Which is very intense, emotionally, hormonally and timewise.

So far from what I have been told mechanical engineering is versatile so that is one thing. I heard you can go with Electrical, aerospace and even materials from what I have been told. Does the type of engineering matter in general or is it more on internships? Is it better to just specialize in space and go with one of the above, if that makes sense?

What kind of engineering can you do in the space sector? Of the top of my head I know you can do systems, optics, and testing. If someone can add onto this that would be greatly appreciated.

I live in a LCOL area . I love my job.

What I want :  I want a job where I work much less: 2 to 3 days a week. Or work daily but a few hours a day-not 9 to 5AND I want to live in my home country about 2 months a year or more. I still want to make abut 60 K. At least.


I don’t have a college degree, and I am not sure what transferable skills I have. The restaurant group I am in is a personal growth cult lol so I went to many personal development seminars etc … leadership training type thing. But I am not the best  at marketing myself. 

Before this career I freelanced for my ex doing Facebook ads for some of his clients, I didn’t get a formal training just tutorials and googling whatever I don’t know. One of my personal strengths is that I am resourceful.

Yesterday I had a meeting with a prospective client around the same age as me, and it was my first time meeting with her. I was totally professional and didn't say or do anything flirtatious, but last night she must have been creeping my Facebook page and liked an old post of mine, which I think was done deliberately to let me know she was looking, and then today she followed me on Instagram. So I feel like she's trying to let me know she's interested in me, and I definitely think she's attractive and she seems very nice and like someone worth getting to know, but I don't want to do anything that could get me in trouble with my job, especially since they are potentially going to become a client of mine. 

Should I mention it to my boss yet? Or is it none of their business what takes place outside of work hours? I was thinking of asking her to coffee but I'm conflicted.

I tend to be someone who over worries about things and over thinks them. I know other people who met their partners through work, I just don't know what the rules are and I don't want to do anything that could land either of us in hot water basically."

804,Is HR/Recruiting playing games with me? Yellow flags,careerguidance,"Got a job offer at a major department in a Fortune 100 company. 

* I made it clear in the first round HR screen that my current base is $90K, and expect ~$120K range to go onwards
* In-house Recruiter said that $100-$110K was the range for the job, but that gap can easily be overcome
* I go through the process. Some yellow flags with managers ""sh*t testing"" me by asking ridiculous questions, seemingly fishing for a reaction
* Excel at the interview. Get a verbal offer via email from recruiting the next week, saying I'll get a formal offer letter shortly
* A few days passes, recruiting messages me saying they are getting HR approval, some HR is OOO, and the offer is delayed
* A week later, recruiter calls me (still no formal letter), and offers $100K. I clearly stated I expect at least 25-30% raise to move on with the process
* I straight up said $100k is not competitive and want $120k+. Recruiter said they'll go review with manager + HR

Are they playing games? A lot of this landed around the holidays, but the dates I mentioned are all in business days, where no major company has time off. 

Then they come with a lowball. My field is ridiculously hot right now and I know for a fact that everyone is struggling hard to hire. There has been no ""formal"" paperwork sent at all.

I'm a bit confused. This is a very reputable company with great reviews. Everybody knows my field is hard to hire. What the heck is going on?"
805,What degree/which studies should I do?,careerguidance,"I am 20 years old, currently on my 2nd gap year (I work as a receptionist in a hostel) and I plan to start my studies next fall. So I have to start applying now!! But I have absolutely no idea what I want to do :( I just know that I want to do my studies in Paris rather (my friends are there and I just love Paris. french is my 1st language) and that I want to do studies that really will be useful... so a bachelors degree at least?

Personally I graduated from HS with a french bac ES (economics). The only subject I liked in high school was math. Not geometry tho, and not theory stuff (I hate that!) but just solving equations, I love that! I've been told though that a math degree alone isn't of much use and it's mostly theoretical. I could consider computer science tho (even tho idk anything about programming or CS). I like psychiatry too (mental illnesses etc.) but you have to have a french bac S to study that. I like languages ​​too. *Ps. I don't want to do long studies, I just want to have a diploma to become more marketable and to be able to earn more.*

As a person, I am autonomous, independent, super stubborn, I know how to talk to people, I like my private space / to work without talking too much with others, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I would be super grateful if you could suggest some studies/degrees that might be the one for me :).** I will rather study in Paris but I'm ready for other cities too (eg Toulouse, Lyon, etc.)"
806,How do I get more motivated about my career?,careerguidance,"I graduated in 2017 and I have been in my field ever since, so 5 years or so now. I am still at ""level 1"" position with no internal promotions. I have promoted myself twice by leaving a position for a higher paying job but position and duty wise it has always been a lateral move for more money.

I never received internal promotion because I never ""went above and beyond"" or completed business goals. A common thing at all of my companies have is they make me outline a couple goals at the beginning of the year and on order to get a favorable yearly review I need to complete these goals.

Never have I ever been motivated to compete these goals. I see people all around me through my career busting their butt, working unpaid extra hours on salary, and never getting rewarded for it. I figure, why should I if no one else is getting rewarded? I just want to do my job I signed up and studied in school for. I don't want to do tangential busy work to brown nose for an extra percent raise, I'm not motivated at all to do it. Even when I lay out relatively easy goals on purpose to put it bluntly I can't be bothered to do them, I just don't care. 

I also am not motivated to continue my education in any way. I know a lot of people go to school for additional degrees and certifications, but I have no desire to go back to school and progress. I am content what I do and in my career path people who get these degrees end up being managers and that isn't what I want to do. Besides, I don't want more student loans anyway. 

Generally I am not even motivated in my career. The work is so different than what I studied and went to school for. My work is probably 80% paperwork and 20% actually what I want to do and studied for. I find little enjoyment in my field, I feel like my degree bait-and-switched me for what I was going to be doing for a career, and having been at 3 companies I think I have been around enough to notice it's not just the employees, it is the industry that is stagnant and boring. I can't get motivated to do anything except go into work, put on my time and do my daily tasks, get my work done on time and that's it. Nothing extra. He'll, in this economy I don't even get rewarded enough to buy a home, and if it wasn't for student loan forbearance I don't think I would have gotten paid enough to pay them off. I see no reward to try.

Offer 1: - Promising company with really great revenue growth and double the head count year-over-year for the last 5 years - The benefits package is super good (6 weeks paid vacation) - The CEO and HR are very efficient. I was interviewed last Friday and received my offer letter on Monday. - In a city that I don't like - Is not an English speaking province - I need to transfer my provincial healthcare to this province and it will take at least another 1.5 years before I can get my surgery

Offer 2: - Company has ups and downs. The product is pretty generic and nothing spectacular. It just laid off quite a bit of people during COVID. - The benefits package is not that good (2 weeks paid vacation) - CEO and HR are very slow. They contact me and told me they will send me the employment contract but keep delaying it for almost 2 weeks now. I texted the CEO on Thursday and he said he will either send it Thursday or Friday. It's already Friday and I still have not received it yet. - It is my home town, so my friends and family are all here - It is an English speaking province - I have the provincial healthcare here so I will be able to get my surgery within half a year.

The salary is about the same, but I am unsure how to proceed. Any recommendations?"

I'm currently debating a big decision and would like some input. For the past 2 years I've been at a pretty big company, and since then have had 3 managers. My new manager just started as of 1/1, and I really don't think we mesh well. I could see my position being eliminated from him in maybe 9 months or so that plays a role.

With that being said, I'm fully remote, and in my house with my fiance in the Northeast. We are getting married in Summer of 2023. We live a chill life and nothing too crazy.

I have an opportunity to take over a role in Florida, where I would be out in the field. This would pair me with my old manager, who loves me, and is just great. It's a significant pay increase, (25k base 20 bonus increase, car, gas, etc). Obviously it scares me being out on my own everyday, since the last 3 years I've been in my office.

I would have to be there minimum of 1 year to even think about an internal transfer back east. Moving away from friends/family would be tough, but that is why I would only do it for 12-15 months. I told my manager this and she understood as well.

It would be more work for sure, quite a huge change in my life, but I really ultimately would want to move back here before the wedding (15 months from now ) and to start a family, (Im almost 30)

Is it crazy to take this position only for a year, bank some money, and if I can't transfer internally after, just resign and find a new employer after a year?

Thanks for any advice."
818,Have to send acceptance of Offer by end of day- Help?!,careerguidance,"Long story short,  I'm in healthcare right now and as you can imagine it sucks. My regular job has been more or less redeployed to doing direct care: feeding people, etc. 

I have a job offer that is totally different from anything I've done. It's for-profit eco-tourism / community development firm, working on project management. With travel within the country! Seems neat! 

The first ""red flag"" is they requested I do a 2 week internship to see if it's a good fit. I said well I can't, I have to work full time? So what they did is scaled my wage. 1st month probation- less money. Then an additional wage for 6 months, THEN the wage I'm somewhat happy with after that. It's not a big boost in salary, but some. 
And some commission opportunities based on projects they secure. 

Is that normal?

Anyways, the last thing is that they don't provide any extended healthcare benefits. Here in Canada at least the basics are covered, but it's prettttty standard to offer some form of additional benefits such as dental, meds etc. 🤔

I feel confused. I think I'd learn a lot of great skills, it's fully remote with neat travel, which would be a welcome break from the throes of healthcare. But I've never worked for a for-profit company so I'm feeling weirded out and morally confused.

819,Is a degree even worth it?,careerguidance,"Brief overview of my situation:

I'm currently 27 with no degree (I do have some schooling/credits). I was in the military for 6 years in the technical field which allowed me to land a pretty decent job once I got out. I work a lot (60hrs/week) but I also make a decent amount ($120k+/year).

My parents (Asian lol) have both been egging/nagging me NONSTOP about my lack of education. I don't think I need one as the field I am in is expanding and job security is pretty high. However my parents argue that I will never be able to move up the ladder or make any progress with no degree. 

And part of it is true. To move up to a supervisory role or up the corporate ladder, I do need some sort of 4 year degree. But if I were to go for a degree I would have to stop doing any overtime and just work my normal shift. If I did that my pay would drop back to around $85k/year and spend about 2-3 years finishing up my degree (engineering/technology degree). I dont have to pay for my degree either as I have my GI bill I can use.

So is getting a degree even worth it at my age? I feel like it's not given my circumstance, but my parents are relentless in telling me I'll get nowhere in life without one..."

827,Pivoting out of IT while I can - What are comparable positions where my IT B.S. degree is valuable and/or other affordable trades/certs I can obtain within a year?,careerguidance,"Hello All,

I am 24 y/o and have a B.S. in Information Technology. I have been working in IT for 5 years now, recently having been promoted from IT Support to Systems Administrator.

Both IT positions I have held involve full top to bottom control of medium company's from access control, surveillance, servers, networking, desktop, laptop, mobile, printers, cybersecurity, VoIP, major projects, direct work with Corporate etc. The positions always start narrow in scope and end up becoming carrying the entire company on my back because everything trickles down to landing in ITs lap regardless of if its actually a relevant job responsibility or not.

I simply cannot take it anymore though, it really boils down to the constant 24/7 contact outside of work hours and expectation to be available at every second of every day, inability to freely use PTO because no one else can cover what I do etc. but there's also the element of refusal to follow procedures and policies, the disrespect of the entire profession as a whole but I am sure these are prevalent in many fields. I know enough of the experience of others from talking to folks in the field, and people on Reddit in the field, that its the same everywhere and its only continuing to get worse (especially with labor shortages in IT being some of the most prominent recently). Everyone else gets to come in 9-5 where I work but the endless work, the worry, the constant flow of alerts and direct messages is just unsustainable to me mentally.

I am seeking to make some sort of change now while I am younger so I don't resign myself to a life of this.

With that said, I am currently making 75K a year. I am looking for input on other jobs where my IT experience may help me pivoting into a new career. Alternatively, it there are other specialties or trades that don't require a 4 year learning commitment to become eligible for I would be up for that as well. I am looking for something with 75K potential but if I need to drop back down to where I started IT at 55K I am willing to do it for my own sanity and physical health. 

I do not have kids and will not be having them, so that takes a burden off of worrying about financially supporting others or having to move towns. I will be married soon so health insurance is not a concern, as I can pay for it through my wife's plan.

Please let me know if there's any job roles, certifications, trades etc. that I can get involved in in a year or less time, or leveraging my existing education and experience.

828,Pivoting out of IT while I can - What are comparable positions where my IT B.S. degree is valuable and/or other affordable trades/certs I can obtain within a year?,careerguidance,"Hello All,

I am 24 y/o and have a B.S. in Information Technology. I have been working in IT for 5 years now, recently having been promoted from IT Support to Systems Administrator.

Both IT positions I have held involve full top to bottom control of medium company's from access control, surveillance, servers, networking, desktop, laptop, mobile, printers, cybersecurity, VoIP, major projects, direct work with Corporate etc. The positions always start narrow in scope and end up becoming carrying the entire company on my back because everything trickles down to landing in ITs lap regardless of if its actually a relevant job responsibility or not.

I simply cannot take it anymore though, it really boils down to the constant 24/7 contact outside of work hours and expectation to be available at every second of every day, inability to freely use PTO because no one else can cover what I do etc. but there's also the element of refusal to follow procedures and policies, the disrespect of the entire profession as a whole but I am sure these are prevalent in many fields. I know enough of the experience of others from talking to folks in the field, and people on Reddit in the field, that its the same everywhere and its only continuing to get worse (especially with labor shortages in IT being some of the most prominent recently). Everyone else gets to come in 9-5 where I work but the endless work, the worry, the constant flow of alerts and direct messages is just unsustainable to me mentally.

I am seeking to make some sort of change now while I am younger so I don't resign myself to a life of this.

With that said, I am currently making 75K a year. I am looking for input on other jobs where my IT experience may help me pivoting into a new career. Alternatively, it there are other specialties or trades that don't require a 4 year learning commitment to become eligible for I would be up for that as well. I am looking for something with 75K potential but if I need to drop back down to where I started IT at 55K I am willing to do it for my own sanity and physical health. 

I do not have kids and will not be having them, so that takes a burden off of worrying about financially supporting others or having to move towns. I will be married soon so health insurance is not a concern, as I can pay for it through my wife's plan.

Please let me know if there's any job roles, certifications, trades etc. that I can get involved in in a year or less time, or leveraging my existing education and experience. I am more than open to taking a step backwards I just cant afford to waste my 55K degree starting from minimum wage again. I just simply do not know what to look for as I have always been in IT.

Cheers, thanks to everyone in advance."

836,Should I reach back out to an HR Manager that almost hired me?,careerguidance,"So, in the beginning of last year, I had been speaking with an HR Manager for a company that wanted to grow their HR. I got along really well with the manager, and whenever we spoke on the phone, our conversations would last around 45 minutes just discussing both the role, my aspirations and work style in general. She seemed to really like me.

Fast forward a couple months, she says that since the role was new, it would take a while to finalize everything and make an offer, but that she was still interested in me. I couldnt wait though and accepted a job somewhere else. 

Fast forward to now and I'm not exactly loving my place of work. My day to day is fine but higher up in HR management is completely disorganized and lately they've been adding more and more work to my plate, helping other locations and not offering me anything more. The work is beyond my pay grade and meant for HR positions that make 6 figures, but they're short staffed. I feel taken advantage of and HR leadership offers very little in terms of acting like they appreciate that I do the work of higher paid position.

Now, the HR manager that I talked to last year was very understanding when I took this role instead. But she told me to stay in touch with her. I thanked her and that was it.

I am starting to look again, mostly because I am tired and my coworkers, who are the only reason i can get through these days, are also thinking of leaving because everyone feels overworked and under appreciated. Should I reach back out? The role she was initially going to offer me no doubt got filled by now, but I dont want to lose out on this contact. 

Should I reach back out? I don't want to outright say I'm looking again but I'd also like to know how everything is going at the company. I'm not sure how to word it and would like some help because I think it could be a great opportunity."

854,It Must Be Time to Give Up Following My Dreams… right? (tldr included),careerguidance,"I once was set on playing drums for a living and was setup pretty well to start with a pretty good professional network. Not to mention I lived near two very hot music scenes, Philly and NYC. However, around the end of august/early September in 2020 after my graduation from high school, my parents decided they wanted to move to buttfuck nowhere in Appalachian Virginia, 8-9 hours from home; and two months later they did, so since the beginning of November 2020 I’ve been here, in the hills with them. since I was unprepared to go off on my own then, I had no choice but to tag along. That pretty much ground my early ‘professional’ music career to a halt as most of the opportunity was projected to come out of the great music scenes in Philly in New York. Be that gigging opportunity or networking for touring and studio opportunity. Sure, online networking is huge for musicians today but early in a career, it’s best to be in a healthy physical music scene.

So I was kinda stripped of a lot of that potential post-covid opportunity. To be honest I’ve been in a shitty place this past year+ mentally and I feel like my youth is kinda wasting away but I’m looking at making some possible changes in my career goals. I’m at a crossroads and I’m not trying to jump the gun and do something I regret. Over the last year, I’ve lost a lot of the confidence I had in doing music full time eventually. I’m actually looking at possibly going to school for four years if I can get my shit together mentally. Still not sure if I wanna go right away though or move somewhere with a hotter scene and at least give music a good shot… and that’s one thing I’m here to ask a bunch of opinionated stranger’s thoughts on. 

The biggest draw to college is that it would be payed for. I’m fortunate to have wonderful parents who would fund my education in its entirety along with nearly all of my living expenses while I’m there. So in a way, I’d feel dumb if I didn’t go and take advantage of the opportunity to go to school without financial worries or the concern of student debt. As for school itself, It’d make me a more well rounded individual, give me some hopefully fair income within a year of getting out of school, amongst some other smaller benefits. 

The biggest arguments against it are in the realm of what I feel I could study at school. I have diagnosed ADD that’s pretty bad and I tend to loose interest easily in things. I’m very good with money and time management, I actually took a handful of classes on this in high school but I’m worried that if I choose to major in something that isn’t interesting to me or involves too much math (the only area in which really I struggle… but struggle a LOT), or just get to the point where I have too much on my plate academically, Ill dropout. If I go to school I want to get it all done in one shot. I’d like to study English, but I’m aware of the impracticality of liberal arts degrees employability wise, so I feel like the only decent options that fit the criteria may be in the business area. But this is another thing I’m open to advice and suggestions on.


TLDR // SUMMARY: 

I - Would you attempt a career as a working musician before going to college that’s fully paid for, or go to school first? 

II - What would you study when you like subjects in liberal arts, but are aware of their real-world impracticality, but also know that keeping interest and focus in something else would be very difficult? (student loans and cost of school not a factor)"

The thing is, there's so many things I'd like to do yet they are so different from each other. I would like to study a sports degree, maybe an business administration one (I'd love to have several small businesses), and I'd even try out studying to be a teacher for the great conditions they have. My aim is to try out different things in my life, yet with only one title I'd be trapped.

The thing is it's not all about the study, at least for now. I want a degree where there's people I can talk to, not just some League of Legends bums. There were 3 girls in my class and 45 boys.

**Current job** \--   
**Pros** \- been here almost 7 years, have developed good ""work friends"" with coworkers and clients.... benefits are top tier, (retirement match, vacation, healthcare) including retiree benefits.  My area has been working remotely for 2 years. Can work remote going forward, but with a big caveat, see below.  
**Cons** \- Most of the leadership since I have been here has changed slowly time and not for the better.  I was promised pay for taking on extra work and it never happened. One of my new primary bosses is mean to me. However this person may retire in 5 years.  My other boss, who has been here longer, is nice, but he has not protected me from this other boss like I hoped he would. I may be forced to go back to the office in a hybrid model, in a few months...but this is a trial hybrid, and leadership may decide to go back remote.  If I want to work 100% remote, it is allowed, but I would have to move far away....anyone living local they want eventually to bring in on a hybrid basis, is my sense.  
**New job offer** \-   
**Pros** \- 7 grand more pay ---- the team and leadership REALLY like me and want me, and have made that known.  I can work remotely 100% however, I would have to live somewhere inside the borders of new york state.  I am actually from new york state, and could potentially live near extended family, though. I don't have family where I am now, though I made a good circle of friends here.  
There is a ladder for career advancement, that dosen't really exist where I am now. Of course, there is no guarantee I get any promotions. But the ladder is there.  
**Cons**\---have to sell my house, however the market where I am now is hot, and I could sell for a profit. The pain in the assness/work of moving to a different state. The benefits are maybe 70% as good as where I am now (at best..I feel like I'm being generous saying 70%) --- thats everything...healthcare, retirement match, vacation, ect.   
**Here is the wildcard to consider**......In addition to this job discussed above that I am wrestling with what to do about, I actually work a separate 100% remote contract gig that is open ended and on-going, no official end date, like alot of contracts have. For all intents and purposes, it's permanent, barring any fuckups on my part. I would really like to keep this side job....its super easy work, for fantastic money, and again, everyone is nice.  However this company prefers its remote workers to stay a resident of Michigan.  I was told that they might be willing to make an exception for me though, since you know what has changed so much of how they think of where their workers live.   Here is my follow up wildcard question... if they say I have to live in MI to keep this side gig, is it worth turning down the job offer, as they would require me to live in NYS?   Should I turn down the NYS job offer, and stay at my current main job, keep working my contract job no problem, and try to wait out 5 yrs for that mean boss to retire?

We usually get new projects on very short notice (0-5 days). Clients usually have absolutely no clue what they are doing, the environment is in many cases somewhat hostile (had about 5 ppl crying in meetings during the last two years), I usually have no say in any matter but have to „get it done anyway“, as soon as I join, everything seems to be my responsibility. The partner of our firm oversells all of our staff to a high extent, I get sold as „an absolute expert on tool XY“ although I never ever used that tool to begin with. In the past I had to train colleagues in addition to my high workload (50-70hr weeks), just for them to get staffed on another project 1-2 months later (so it‘s basically a net negative for me). Colleagues often miss appointments and deadlines (b/c we are all staffed on 2-5 different clients and projects), when talking to my „boss“, he just says that its my responsibility that my colleagues attend the meetings, so for some time I sent them reminders by phone 5-10 mins before a meeting of theirs start… all of this makes me very anxious, uneasy and exhausted. I entered therapy some months ago. Although it got better, I still feel stressed out most of the time.

I have a decent amount of downtime and my boss is in a different state, so people at this branch don’t even know when I’m not busy really. It’s not horrible, and I’m in a LCOL area in the south.

My schedule is 7-3:30 M-F and I get 2 weeks vacation, 5 sick days. I’ll be at 3 weeks in another year or two. 

I was offered a job at a much better company (state utilities company). It is a Buyer position, so not involved in sales at all. But supply chain is super stressful. 

The pay is $60,000 salary working 8-5, so adding another 30+ mins to my work day. The kicker is, it’s an hour drive and cannot be done remotely. It’s still a full on desk job, but adding two hours to my day driving. They said I would be eligible for a $5000 bonus each year. The benefits are better, and they would also pay for me to get a masters degree if I went back to school. The city it is located in is nice, but very busy and my wife and I probably would not move there. 

With the drive it is basically 52 hours per week vs my 40 now. And I drive a very old car. Gas is expensive. 

I really want to take it but it would almost be the same pay hourly, I would just have less free time.

876,Can you help me decipher my President's actions when discussing a raise?,careerguidance,"I work for a smaller company (45ish employees). It's need 2 years without a raise. I have had overwhelmingly positive reviews with my supervisor. He recommended I set up a conversation with my president and head of HR about a raise. 

I have taken on responsibilities beyond my description and mad a large name for myself with our clients. 

I set up the meeting and said I wanted to discuss my goals with the company. 

The meeting started with me saying I wanted to discuss my current compensation and my future role with the company. 

The meeting was generally positive saying I was ready for supervisory roles, and larger speaking roles (I do medium size speaking ones currently). And asked what my goals were. 

They said they would get back to me on a new role with new responsibilities.

I then asked about my current compensation based on my performance. I was told by my president ""more compensation will come from additional duties""

That REALLY didn't rub me the right way, as I have been working my tail off with stellar reviews from my supervisor. He has stated that he has pushed these things upwards.

About an hour after the call the head of HR called me back. She stated that What the president said had been not stated well. I was told that I was going to be getting a raise once they restructured some things around. She said the reason for calling me back was she said she noticed a drop in my energy when being told no to a raise.

I'm not sure if she was trying to salvage my relationship with the company or what. 

I should be hering back from them next week about the new role (whether or not It's a promotion we will see). Needless to say, I took an interview yesterday as well as im not exactly happy with the initial response from the president.

The thing about this institution is that its employee turnover is very low and openings for managerial position are few and far between and that promotions are usually reserved to those who are most senior (there are several officers who are more senior than I am).

However, a few days ago after I had discussed something work-related with my second level manager he voluntarily told me that there might be a team leader opening that I'm wanted for (in another division which he's not a part of). A couple of days after that , he told me the same thing.

My response in both instances was thanking him for seeing my potential.

I really want this promotion but I wonder how should I have responded? and how should I follow up with him on this to maximize the chances of realizing the promotion without sounding too needy or lacking confidence."
881,Should I (20F) take this job in BCN (lower salary)? Or should I stay here?,careerguidance,"Take into consideration the current restrictions in each of these cities. I currently live in Stockholm and have been here quite some years now. I love how there are no restrictions here but I hate the lack of social life. I am 20F btw. I currently work as a hostel receptionist. My hostel is a chain that is also in Barcelona and Paris. I got a job (starting February) as the reservations&amp;groups executive at that hostel in Barcelona and my salary would be only 1544€ net/month.. Idk how the restrictions are there however. I could also just stay in Stockholm where quality of life is super high but no social life. My current salary in Stockholm is around 1710€ net/month. I haven't gone to uni yet btw but I will next autumn (in France maybe, as french is my 1st language).

**What do you advise me to do? I'm so lost and need to make a decision ASAP.**

Firstly, thank you for giving this post time to read. 

So, I am currently healthcare industry for almost 4 years in my 9 years of experience. Will entrepreneur mindset, started few ideas, which didn't work. Maybe someday will be able to hack it into some idea. 

Planning to move out, due to work-life balance (messy currently)

One offer is with a well funded startup dealing with Logistic, dealing with huge amount of data. Assuming a pressure, with handsome hike approx 33%, potential to have position upgrades every year. 

On the other hand, a fairly large MNC into finance industry with 25% hike. According to few sources have come across they are employee centric. However, there is a demotion in position. (May be due to this being my first MNC position, always a start-up guy). 

What do you guys suggest?

890,Boss is gaslighting to stay for another month after my notice period. How do I tell her no without burning bridges?,careerguidance,"I officially resigned from my workplace a few days ago and they require me to give two months notice period.

The main reason why I resigned is my boss. The last year has been hell for me, where my well-being was always on the line depending on how she felt. I initially planned to resign in a few months’ time but couldn’t take it anymore. 

My boss was very hostile when I informed her of my decision. And basically ignored me for a day after. 

Today she called me in her room and told me she needs me to stay for another month because it’s the least I could do for her as she wants me to train the new person that will be taking over my position. If she had asked me nicely, I would’ve done it in a heartbeat. But she spent 30 minutes explaining why I had to do it and that I owed her at least this much. When I said I couldn’t commit immediately, she told me that I have to reassure her NOW and that it’ll be a transition period for her.

Ever since I’ve resigned I’ve still been pulling 13 hour days and I simply can’t stand being here anymore. 

The question is how do I say no without letting her continue to gaslight me but at the same time not burn bridges? I hate her guts but my industry is pretty small so I’m not ready to burn bridges.

As we speak, she has been finding for every tiniest opportunity to make my remaining time here worse."
891,Should i quit and downgrade to save my mental health or hang on for the massive salary?,careerguidance,"Recently changed companies and got a much better job, money- and level-wise. But my mental health has taken a sharp nosedive since i started. 

Impostor syndrome is hitting hard, even though i've had nothing but positive feedback so far. I'm hitting this physical and mental block where i'm so paralyzed by the fear of fucking up or doing something wrong i don't do much of anything except attend meetings and push emails around. Rife with anxiety and riddled with guilt about not being my usual workaholic, involved, committed self means i don't and can't enjoy my time 'off' either. 

Did a preliminary psychological evaluation yesterday, because i realise i can't go on in this state of distress. 1st session is monday.

But my family and bf are kind of pushing me to keep giving it time, they've been saying this for the past couple of months, since i started opening up. They mean well, because i'm working remotely and the salary level is insane for where we live. I'm buying an apartment and will still have enough to support myself for months or a year if need be, though i'm hoping it won't. 

Deep down i'd like to quit, do nothing for a couple of months other than therapy, work on wellbeing and on my relationship, do up the new apartment, then maybe look into a masters and part time gig. 

How bad would it be for me later on to have a big position on the cv for just about 6months? Would it be better if i not just downgrade, but change industries? What's the most 'explainable' career path narrative here?

Or, do you agree with the family, and would i be crazy for giving up my huge salary which i've so far gotten by doing maybe 10% of what my normal, non burned out, non depressed self would do?"

898,Is it possible to switch from engineer to therapist/counselor?,careerguidance,"Hello!

I'm 25 years old and I've been feeling pretty soul-sucked and burnt out from three years in my career as a mechanical engineer after getting my undergrad degree. My current career, and what feels most purposeful and fulfilling to me, frankly aren't aligned. I get the most fulfillment, I notice, when I'm able to sit and listen to close friends (or even acquaintances), help them feel understood, and deep dive into introspective conversation with them. To help them sort through issues or feelings or explore what makes them tick.

Honestly, I made the choice to become an engineer out of practicality - it was a springboard to escape shitty, abusive, drug-addicted parents and to obtain a level of financial security I've never had growing up. Also I really liked calculus class in high school, haha. Well, now I have that security and I crave a career that is more aligned with my deeper calling to help other people on an interpersonal level. Looks like I've moved on up in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs! ;)

I know deep in my heart I want to pursue a career where I'm engaging deeply with other people, and spending a few years in therapy myself I've realized the positive impact it can have on a person! However, I'm noticing a lot of what's holding me back is financial fears. I am afraid that if I start to make moves in the career-switching direction, I'll end up struggling financially again. I know that the road to becoming a therapist can be a challenging one - 3+ years of schooling along with starting out on a couple years of unpaid/low-paying internships. I don't really have any family to fall back on or live with if I were to go for it... If money were no object, I'd probably already have gone for it.

Any willing to give this lost redditor some advice would be greatly appreciated. &lt;3"

905,How to decline a promotion without committing career suicide? Houston Texas.,careerguidance,"7 years ago I moved across the country for a junior sales role with a Fortune 500 petrochemical, oil, and gas company. My intent was always to put in my time to get to the job I want which is to be a territory manager for our largest product line, located back in the Midwest (closer to my and my wife’s entire families, home office) and I am currently close (it would be a logical promotion to this job from my current role). I have also made it very well know via my mentors and management what job I want (I have not told anyone it is my end goal as it would appear incredibly unambitious)

Today I received a phone call from the VP of the desired product and I was pretty shocked in that he told me a position would be opening up, he knows I want into this product line, and he thinks I would be a good fit, and set a meeting next week for us to grab lunch and discuss in detail. While this may seem great, and it is a promotion, this is not the job I want. It’s a management role (I’m not very interested in managing people), it’s an office based role (I have almost always been remote and have 0 interest in changing that) and involves a fair bit of international travel (I love domestic travel and hate international travel). Most importantly it would likely remove the job I want from the playing field forever (if would be a weird demotion). Management  sees this as an even better job for me than the Midwest territory manager job I’ve been keen on. 

Is there a way to go about declining this offer while not shooting my career in the foot and not ruining my future chances to get the job I really want?"
906,How transparent should I be with an interviewer whose offer I might decline?,careerguidance,"I've been interviewing for almost a whole month with a potential employer. They offered me the job about a month ago and have been incredibly patient with me and super friendly. However, after learning more details about the compensation and job expectations about a week and a half ago, I feel that I may end up declining the offer (despite having been genuine in my initial interest). The reason for declining is not lack of interest in their overall work and objectives, but a mix of realizing that I will be taking a significant paycut ($10k), worries about the logistics of transitioning into the new position (I currently work from home and would need to move by the end of the month to a high COL city), and also feeling that I may be underqualified for the position. 

I have already agreed to a meeting to clarify a few job expectations tomorrow -- after which I will be giving them my final decision to either accept or decline. How transparent should I be during the meeting? Should I explain very openly about the concerns I mentioned above? Or would it be more professional to keep some of the details vague? I feel super guilty for all of the time that they've invested in me... it's rare that employers allow candidates so much time to think about an offer (again, I started the interview process almost a month ago). I'm not sure how candid I should be during my conversation with them tomorrow. The last thing I want to do is to piss them off/burn bridges. Thoughts?"

Alternative routes?",careerguidance,"I graduated in may from Texas A&amp;M with a degree in psychology. I didn’t know what I wanted to do throughout the entirety of college, switched majors multiple times and figured psychology was interesting enough. Well after working in a research lab, I found that’s not for me as it was the most robotic individuals I’ve ever worked with, no humor no fun, no joy, just research. Nothing about it felt human at all. I also interned with a psychologist and I simply don’t want to have to handle others trauma, respect to psychologists. It’s just not for me and wouldn’t bring me any sort of joy and I would need therapy from doing that.

I’m working a minimum wage job at REI as I love all things outdoors. I love outdoors, I love plants and gardening and nature and the environment. I’m pretty good at growing fungi I like growing lions mane and some other medicinal and cookable mushrooms. I  also love music, I listen to hour upon hours, I also play guitar and drums but not good enough to do anything with it other than just as a passionate hobby as a bedroom recorder. I definitely lean on the hippy side of the spectrum vs the business side of the spectrum, despite being quite strong in the maths in college. I take health pretty seriously, taking diet quite serious and I feel I hold lots of knowledge on that as well as workout regimes (not your meathead lift heavy weight, nothing wrong with that, just not me anymore, like to incorporate yoga, Calisthenics and weight lifting). 

I am qualified in data entry and am proficient in word. I’ve got some customer service experience, landscaping experience and research experience. Pretty weak I am aware. I can Atleast say with confidence whether it be college or any jobs Ive worked, I haven’t struggled. Half assed college pretty hard and got a 3.5 

I want a career that introduces me to interesting unique people that aren’t totally immersed in the business of society. Everyone always say to make a triangle with what you’re good at, what you’re passionate about and what can make you money and I just can’t make them bc I don’t know what I’m good at, and what I’m passionate about, I guess the things I listed above? Even the. Idk how I could pick just one to go all in on

Did I waste my degree on psych, i was overly pressured by my parents to go get my degree so I just tried to appease them and it has seemingly ruined my life. I Atleast am debt free as my father is ex military and never used his free college so I got to use it. Albeit in Texas. I live in Oregon now and love the area, love climbing, hiking, river rafting, mountaineering, running, mountain biking and everything the state and the Rocky Mountains offer.

At this point I feel like I’m having a quarter life crisis. It doesn’t help my long distance partner of 4 years has her career seemingly figured out and just has to graduate college in a couple years. Just makes me feel like a loser to be frank about it.

910,Salary Negotiation for a promotion specifically created for me?,careerguidance,"I joined a startup of about 40 employees as part of the CRM team as a junior associate to help managers with their clients. 

Fast forward to present day and was told by the department head that I will be leading a newly created team to further support the company but also take on cross departmental project work. It seemed like he saw the impact I was making and pushed for this promotion to be his right hand. Senior management seems to be on board as they've all mentioned about the impact they've noticed. 


I'm wondering if a move like this has room for salary discussion, especially because the position is a new one in the industry with extremely limited salary information. Do startups also follow rules like salary bands or wage increase policies? 

Our company doesn't exactly have an HR department, so my department head would most likely be determining my job description and compensation. We'll be having a deeper discussion about the promotion a few weeks before the paperwork. Would it be kosher to bring compensation up now as we discuss the role or wait until the paperwork?"

I started this degree to make more money and have more autonomy, I’d love to hear insight from those in an administrative level in healthcare (public or private) who previously worked clinical and whether it was worth to move up?

About 9 months ago I asked for a substantial raise — didn’t get it all but I did get a decent raise along with my standard annual review. Ever since then my boss has been talking with me about how to advance my career within the company to get closer to where I want to be salary wise. About 3 months ago he recommended a promotion to Senior Widget Designer, which was great.

Just this week the promotion finally went through.

During our recent 1:1 I asked him if this would affect my compensation and he answered with a long winded “can’t say for sure but probably, we’ll know after annual reviews which could take till June.”

This was pretty disappointing. I’m my field a jump to senior can mean a $20k+ raise. I am surprised that a company like mine doesn’t have clear salary requirements when someone is promoted — so surprised that it feels like I am being tricked or misled somehow. I also feel like my boss is trying to manipulate me into staying on by offering me a better title without more pay. Moreover it also creates substantial uncertainty for me personally over the next six months since I don’t know where my comp is going to land. Generally I just feel like I’m being jerked around.

921,Engineering career guidance?,careerguidance,"Background: 

I’m 19 y/o from Az with a passion for mechanical engineering. I’ve always loved everything about cars; more specifically, how every part works together to serve a larger mechanical purpose (if that makes sense). My goal in high school was to go to ASU for my bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in order to get into automotive engineering and design. I got my AS through a dual enrollment program in high school, so I graduated from a community college before I even got my diploma. Anyways, I graduated high school in May of 2020 - the worst possible time to graduate (because of our lovely friend Covid-19). I did end up going to ASU after all, but the entire semester was online, and very very difficult. I personally am not able to learn calculus, as well as 16 other credit hours in introduction to engineering courses, entirely online. I completed the full year, but did not pass all of my classes. I still have about 3 years left of school if I go back now, but I’m in a bit of a bind.

My question(s): 

I feel like the resources available now with social media and just the broad scope of the world wide web, that getting my degree may be more work and money than it’s worth. I don’t mean that to sound arrogant, I do understand that math is a very integral piece of engineering, as well as a lot of other aspects that university offers that I won’t have access to. I would be happy to go back to school and focus on math, especially since that’s always been the subject I’ve excelled at; I just don’t know if I have the time or money to go back for engineering. I know I want a career in automotive engineering/design involving the use of CAD and potentially CNC milling. I have some opportunities that I’m taking advantage of now that could lead me toward the career path I’m looking for, but I’m very limited to the people I know, and my current state of inexperience. I’m very eager to learn and grow, and I’m willing to do whatever that may take. Any and all input is greatly appreciated!! Thank you all."

1. No one uses it, 0%
2. Very few use it, 10%, 1/10

926,"What job should I look for when I just want to ""do"" projects?",careerguidance,"I'm floundering, so hopefully this makes sense. I'm thinking of changing jobs but don't know what to look for. When I describe my skills, people immediately advise I check out project management jobs, but when I search, the descriptions don't sound right.

Here's my number one skill and passion: I find the answer to a question that results in lasting meaningful improvement to the company. ""We have to deal with this new regulation. What is it, and how do we follow it?"" ""These two reports don't line up. They were generated by different departments. How do we know which is accurate?"" ""This task is messy, inefficient, and costly. Can it be faster, easier, more accurate?"" ""Our board member onboarding manual is 100 pages long. Does it actually have to be? What would be the best format?"" ""Can we change how we use our database so we can actually generate reports based on the data?""

I don't want to ""manage projects"" in the sense of coordinating a large group of people, making budgets, keeping people on task, etc. I want to ""do projects"". I'm handed a question with a concrete goal and I figure it out. I'm known for this. Jobs have been invented for me for this. But how do I search for a new job when the position seems to only exist after my employer learns what I can do? When an employer creates a position for me, they just give it a generic job title or make something up that doesn't translate to the general job market. I'm stuck."

But I think they care about my age. Is there discomfort in managing someone older than one's self?

Owner is really cool, but i think he has VERY unrealistic expectations.  My first month I am expected to learn the business, find inefficiencies, and come up with a game plan for improvement.  The next 2 months I will be required to make all improvements.  At the same time i am expected to write sop’s for all the companies process workflows (within 3 mos). This is a complex business that produces multiple products with different workflows, and different sales channels.  They have no workflow diagrams or understandable org chart.  While all this provides opportunity, it won’t help me achieve my 3mos goal.  Owner wouldn’t budge on the timeline even after i explained that some system improvements (eg ERP, WMS) can take over a year to plan and implement.

Their website says no unsolicited submissions, however they do leave their address with a note that says “handwritten inquiries only” 

I really dream of working with this company and I believe I have ideas that would benefit them, I am self aware enough to not seem crazy but I don’t want to forever ruin the odds of working with them by coming off too presumptuous. But I don’t want to just wait and never pursue it either."

938,Where to pivot?,careerguidance,"Hello everyone,

I am 24 years old, and I have an associate degree in welding. I have been welding for 4 years soon to be 5 years in April. To be blunt I hate my job and my career choice. I know there are some people out there who love welding, but I am just not one of those people. I quickly realized it was not something I wanted to do forever but I stuck it out to see if my opinion would change. Obviously, it did not. The shop I work out is very racist and is overall just not full of the best people. It makes it hard to get along with my coworkers which just adds an unwanted factor to this whole situation. I have been very fortunate to learn a lot in my current field and I do make good money doing it but it is at the cost of my sanity unfortunately. 

I am currently promoted as far as I can be at my current company without one of the head managers stepping down. My managers above me are all in the range of 40's - 50s in age so not really near retirement age so there is not currently hope of them stepping down. I have even been told that most likely if a position did come available, I would not get it due to my age. So, I feel like I'm trapped at a dead-end in terms of upwards movement for now. 

Back in 2019 I went back to school to get my bachelor's degree in business management. I have a set date to graduate in January 2023 if all goes to plan. My plan was to move into the more ""white collar"" part of the manufacturing world in hopes to tie both my degrees together and my work experience. 

Should I stay and grind out my last year until i graduate and then move into a role with the business management degree? Should I look for a new job right now? If I look for a new job, should I try to find a step into the more white-collar part of the industry?

All advice is welcome, I appreciate it greatly.

I hope this post does not come off as ungrateful or that I am complaining. I know I am very blessed to be in my spot that I am, but I want to keep working for what is best for me and my family."

I am [24M] with solid professional experience (about 4 years worth) in supply chain/logistics/manufacturing. I got one lucky opportunity when I was 19 while in college, and one opportunity kept leading to another as I worked my way through school. Unfortunately, I made a few stupid mistakes between ages 19-21. As a result of such, I have a wet reckless (pretty much one step down from a DUI, as I’ve come to understand it) as well as a misdemeanor identity theft charge on my record. If you met me, or knew me you would never in a million years guess I’d have something like that on my record. I am extremely competent, intelligent, charming and hardworking. However, as a result of such, I am unable to get any kind of professional full time job even with my impressive resume because it always comes down to the background check before starting. I can never get past that so I’m starting to give up with applying anywhere. I am currently on probation for the latter charge until October of this year, so I will start looking into expungement then. But until then, I need some sort of better income. I currently do work as a background actor and freelance photographer to get by, but need something comparable to what I was making working in supply chain (70k+). I have a pretty solid social media following, and think maybe I could put that to use by selling a product, service or something. I need more money to invest and grow.

The assistant supervisor position was primarily weekend shift, now there is an opportunity to apply for the assistant supervisor for afternoon shifts (mon-fri).
I know I have proven my skillset to be beyond their expectations and add great value to the company. From being the CSR, to the only flexible coordinator being able to do any of the 4 coordinator roles we have for both inbounds and outbounds. To now currently running a shift alone managing about 17 people at our site.

I frankly don't give a damn about the content and am mainly doing it for the credentials, and in fact I plan to pursue an MBA in the future.  Long term I'd like to be in a high-level management role, and would probably like to stay more or less in a technical industry, but I have no desire to do technical work in the long term.  My employer is aware (and paying) for the degree, so a large motivation for keeping at it as long as I have is to keep looking good to them.  If I were to quit, I'd devote part of the time saved to prepping for the GMAT.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have insight into it?  I think my main question is how common is it for execs with an engineering undergrad to get a technical master's, and how much of a difference does it make?

This new role would be out of Seattle which would be amazing to live as I’m not too fond of Ohio at all. This new role is a L5 role but has pay a little lower than a L6 and a lot higher than what I make currently. It’s everything I would want, EXCEPT for 1 caveat. The opportunity to move up has been low. The Org chart for the new role is smaller than my current one, and the timeline to move to a L6 role is 3-5 years, whereas I know I can hit it currently in a year.

952,Do junior UX writers need a design or programming background to get hired?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone!

I've become interested in doing a course or masters in UX writing. 

I have a degree in New media and English literature, and my fifteen years of professional experience has consisted mainly of editing and writing for education (books, textbooks, magazines, audio, limited content for apps). I have also got a few years of freelance copywriting and translation for private clients. Was a local newspaper journalist right out of university. In short, I have always been writing or editing.

UX writing appeals to me because it would allow me to really immerse myself in the art of writing. I'm drawn to user research, voice definition and microcopy. I'm a good communicator, I think I'd be good at defending the role of content.

I've also got all I want from my current role as an editor in educational print materials. And I can see that this work doesn't have a very long future. Time to upskill and move forward.

My doubts are the following:

1) Will a good course in UX writing + junior portfolio be enough to get me hired? Or do I need to have some other UX skills like UX design, or programming? I am willing to learn some more technical skills but content is where my heart is.
2) Can anyone recommend a course or master's?
3) Has anyone made the leap from editorial to UX writing and can share advice?

I was excited about my new company, an agency. But once I got there, there were no processes set up and working late was a norm. Now, I don’t mind working late as long the hours spent are productive and meaningful. But I’ve been spending my nights untangling old files. There are multiple fire drills and everything is due yesterday. And I’ve come to realize that the industry isn’t something I’m passionate about. Whereas at my old job, I enjoyed the work I did because the industry was enjoyable (entertainment). 

Today, my coworker gave me a call saying they were about to begin interviews but wanted to connect with me and see if I would consider coming back. It would be a Finance Manager position and an obviously higher pay. To be honest, I wouldn’t be going back for comfort since my coworkers and managers have always given me opportunities to learn, to be challenged and grow and be exposed to new things. The pay would help and my mental health would not suffer anymore. I didn’t leave on bad terms with them and in fact, I’ve been consulting for them as well since I have a great relationship.

Question is, should I take that offer? I’m considering it because:
1) My mental health is taking a toll

A) planned on going into trades and are in them

B) started college careers for degrees, and know what they ultimately want to do

The only issue is I obviously don’t have any degree, or high qualifications to get into those jobs.

Now I can either take a huge loan (for European standards) to finish my studies and be eligible of seeking work. Or go back to Germany for the next 2+ years without much hopes of visiting due to 14day quarantines and so on. 

Thus, my next best idea is to seek an entry level job in one of the plenty Korean / company with Korean subsidiaries around my hometown to work at for 1 year to then become eligible for a transfer work visa. As my fiancé is on track of becoming a diplomat in 3 years traditional ""get hired"" work environments aren't very likely and I will probably resume my e-commerce, freelancing work and if the relationship should fall apart I would not regret not having finished my bachelor's.

968,Which is better: Company experience or growth base?,careerguidance,"I’d like to ask you guys for some views on the following decision I need to take. 

I’ve been working for a large international medical device company  for the last 8 years. It’s actually the first first “real” company I started working for after college. The company has treated me well and I’ve made 3 promotions in the 8 years, of which I started my most recent role 1.5 years ago. 

Now I’m approached by another company, also a large medical device company, for a great role (slightly better - but not too much). 

On the one hand I’d very much like to take it, as I feel that I need to have the experience to have worked in another company. Not only cause I’m just very curious, but was also thinking that this is a good experience - and that this would also be added value to my profile (is this really true?! 🤷🏻‍♂️). Also the role would have me move much closer to my family, which is what I also would be looking really forward to.  

On the other hand, I feel that I’m still not done in my current role and it’s not that my current company is treating me badly. I have a great network and good colleagues of which some of them are good friends. Also due to this, I think that there is a good opportunity for further growth in the company in the future.

TLDR; Is (in my case) in the long run, the experience of working in another company, worth more/less than the growth base I’ve built in my current company?

I don't really have a dream job because I get bored so easily doing the same thing constantly, so I figured given my situation, it would be more beneficial for me to be a jack of all trades, given that we can move anywhere around the country or even overseas. 

So my question is what are some jobs I could get just about anywhere? I'd like to add as many things to my tool belt as possible so whenever we move I know I'll have options as far as work goes. So far my only work experience is fixing aviation weapon systems on helicopters. 

Also, when I say low educational requirement, I mean like associates degree and lower, like certificates.

Even if I do not have any tasks to work on, I'll make some improvements on my previous code, making a lot of global components and reusable functions to make our work a lot easier, playing around with Vue.js, and do some programming challenges with Javascript. I really enjoyed my time there and I am really good at my job even though the company is toxic and high-pressured. Since I feel like I deserve better I decided to look for another company. After a series of interviews, I landed at a remote company as a UI Designer. At the very beginning, I enjoyed doing some feedback and commentaries about some designs and existing web pages in my current company. I usually do a lot of research before creating a UI Design. However, as time went by, for like 6 months, I find it somehow boring and repetitive. There's nothing new to work on. My manager is also unresponsive these past few days so I got no commentaries about my latest works.  I am the only designer here so I cannot ask for help from others (except for my manager who can give me constant feedback on my works and is willing to give me a hand if I am struggling but she's unresponsive these past few days). I'm also somewhat reliant on my manager because she is the only one who can give me some tasks to work on. Now that she's somewhat inactive, I've been finding ways on how to be productive on my work and be motivated at all times. I've been thinking of ways and key results on what I should accomplish this Q1. However, I am somewhat lost. My productivity and motivation are really low, and I cannot think of any things or objectives to achieve this Q1. I am lost. I wanted to reach out to my manager but I am too afraid to ask.   


I wanted to find some fun in designing but I can't think of any. As a UI Designer, how do you enjoy your work? Especially when things get boring and repetitive and when you do not have a task to work on?"
980,How to know when a challenging job change is a step too far?,careerguidance,"I started new role July 2021 in a type of strategic costing. It's a new position for the company I'm in so there's an element of autonomy defining where I best fit. At the moment I'm supporting R&amp;D teams with cost reduction projects (understanding bottlenecks etc.) and looking more broadly at cost ownership across the business. 

Previously I'd worked as a mechanical engineer in another business unit but felt like I was stagnating after 3/4 years of similar projects and experiences. I used to move projects from point A to B and deal with some issues in the middle. Now I'm deciding where to focus cost out efforts and how to understand our cost base so we have a sustainable business for the future.

The switch was an opportunity to try something new and challenge myself but I've found the last couple of months quite difficult. I don't do well with uncertainty and open ended tasks and they can make be feel stressed and anxious. 

I'd be interested to hear from you about your experiences of changing jobs, especially where you felt it meant operating differently from your norm. I'm sure there are both sides too, those who stuck with it and grew and those who decided it just wasn't for them. 

Thanks! :)"

982,"How do I ask for a raise when I need one, but don’t feel like I can?",careerguidance,"Title is my question here. I’ve been at this engineering company for a little over two years, it’s my first job right out of college. It’s absolutely not what I want to be doing, but they’re the only company that actually gave me an interview and then an offer. I work as an environmental scientist assessing properties for pollution and such. 

It’s boring, but valuable for real estate and thus secure in work. My starting pay wasn’t much, but it was more than I’d ever made before. However during the pandemic I was put on furlough, during which I made more on unemployment than I would have from my paycheck. I feel as though at times they’ve used this “against” me, telling me I’m not as experienced as I am due to the break period (this doesn’t stop them from claiming I have as much experience as I do to clients though). 

I like my boss, and I enjoy that they let me work from home, but honestly all the things that were once positive have begun to be overshadowed by my salary. It’s expensive where I live (suburbs of NYC), and between my rent and student loans I haven’t been able to save up money for two years, just financially treading water. I just turned 26, so now I’ve got insurance added to that. Things are tight. 

This job doesn’t exactly allow me to have projects I can point to and be proud of. If I do my job right every report should be boiler plate. No such thing really as “exceptional work,” and I don’t really get feedback unless something is bad. So I can’t really point to my “accomplishments” and say I’m worth more money. The only metric I have is “utility” which just means I have to make them a certain amount of money a month from my projects (I have no control over pricing). 

From what I see online I am substantially underpaid, and to ask for a raise that would get me close to the average pay in my area would require asking for a 50% increase. Obviously I would be laughed out of the office for doing so, but financially I cannot afford to get through this year on this pay. 

I get messages on LinkedIn and Indeed from recruiters every now and then, but it’s for the same job I have right now, which I’m miserable doing. And from what I hear in the field, my company is at least one of the “nicer” ones as far as corporate culture goes. Plus when I have responded to the recruiters they just ghost me. Trying to get other environmental work is a joke. I’ve thought about further schooling, but I cannot afford any more loans, and honestly when I was in my final year of college I wasn’t in a good place, I don’t think I can afford the mental/emotional toll of going back to school. 

I’m really just lost here, I’ve never had a job where I could even ask for a raise before, and as this year goes by I really can’t afford not to ask for an increase in pay. But part of me feels as though I don’t “deserve” a substantial raise, because I’m only two years into the job and have nothing to show for it (I could be here ten years and I’d have nothing to show for it though). 

I probably sound a little pathetic here, but I work long hours and have had a particularly bad day at work, so I’m just desperate for any advice."

30 y.o. male with a BA in public relations and a MS in communications. I have about 3 years of professional experience in communications/marketing. I’ve applied to many communications and marketing jobs but never received an offer for employment. I often blame Covid for the lack of people hiring in the communication industry.

Currently, I’m working at a hospital as a clerk in the emergency room full time. I’m considering perusing education for a BSN degree since my employment would cover most of the costs. 

Would I be wasting my education pursing a career in the medical industry or did I give up looking for communication work too soon? The difference in earning potential seem substantial, but I don’t want to allow my last 10 years of education seem like a waste of time.

I know that if offered, I will take it for sure but I definitely feel guilty about leaving my current job. Since last June I have worked as a receptionist at a small animal hospital. Before that I worked at FedEx office and it was such a toxic work environment I was driven to clinical depression. Anyway, the job itself is alright on good days to mind-numbingly boring and dealing with awful customers on the worst days (but I get to see puppies). 

However, the staff has been amazing to me and I’ve made a couple of phenomenal friends and they’ve been very caring to my needs in case of things like emergencies. The pay is okay but I will need to be earning more very soon for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

However having looked at recent advances in brain implants (and the development of aspiring companies such as neuralink) i want to be equipped with the proper academic background in order to more easily contribute to that field

Having said that its not exactly clear to me if i can get into a neuroscience post-grad from a maths major. From what ive read youre allowed to get a post-grad unrelated to your original field but im not sure if

a) it is true in my case and

b) if the education in a post-grad is also meant for people that come from other fields, meaning will the study material be actually comprehensible from someone with no biology background

In any case, is there any way for me to get involved/have the education needed for brain implants/bcis?

TLDR; Am in math major with focus in cs and will pursuit machine learning since its kind of a mix of both. I find brain implants interesting and want a neuroscience post-grad so i can get involved. Can i combine all that?"

I had a question regarding asking for a raise at my current employer.

My question is, would this meeting be a good time to discuss receiving a larger raise?  I have recently taken on more responsibility and have joined a special team at work, and I feel i deserve something above whats usually given. Would you recommend this approach? Or should i keep quiet at this time? Anything would be helpful.

I created and teach a very cool Specialist class at my PK3-8th grade private school in Houston called “Think. Make. Talk.” That is all about critical thinking and creative problem solving. We have a lot of fun and one could argue that I really do have the best job at my school but I am SO burnt out. The past two years have been brutal. 

I make $62k and have decent benefits (1.5% raise each year, 4% employer 401k matching, $2400 contribution to my HSA) and obviously I only work 9 months of the year. My kids would get a significant tuition discount if they came to school here but I am interested in getting out of Houston entirely. I really want to make more money but to work 12 months, I think I would need to make at least $80-85k/year. 

I have always loved technology, creative thinking, art, finance/money/spreadsheets/budgeting, graphic design, music, travel, etc. I am super organized, love to research, am good with people and projects and collaborating, got good bullshit, am detail-oriented, artistic/creative. I think there are a lot of things I would be good at, honestly. I just don’t know what they are. I would LOVE to find a company that allows me to work remotely or possibly a hybrid situation.

My pay is avg. I won't say it's good, or bad. It's avg for a fresher ig. But I don't know if there's much to learn in this project. It's very difficult to switch projects since I'm a fresher.
So what do you think? Should I give it a year and see where it goes? I'm thinking I want to do masters too. I might try preparing for it while I'm working on this project. Or should I try switching jobs? The noticed period is very high so I'm a lil skeptical.

1003,Next steps towards career growth advice?,careerguidance,"I am a bit younger (21) and doing online schooling when I’m not working. For some context I already have an associates of science and am working on a bachelors.

I started working for a banking company to get some business experience as I thought it would be a good opportunity for growth and knowledge. The company hired me on at basically the lowest position they offer and started me at 41k a year (pre tax of course). Nonetheless I thought the pay was fair when I started and had no quarrel with the position as they said at the time it was the only position they had available.

With that, the day I started, my boss thought I was hired on as a different position with higher pay and more expectations and was pretty much clueless on what I needed to do my first week of training. I had a bad experience with training and overall knowledge from my supervisors and just felt somewhat undermined. I then spoke to my higher up about being moved into the higher position as our cluster needed the workers and it would be win win situation. He refused and told me I’m not experienced enough and they can’t justify moving me into that position. So I said ok and proceeded with my training thinking maybe if I worked hard enough they would recognize my abilities and give me a shot at it.

So after I finished training I started to gradually do more and more of what the higher position would be responsible for. These were all things I had to learn on my own too due to the staffing issues and just started feeling like I shouldn’t be doing these things. Now at this point I take on almost all the responsibilities that the higher position does and yet no change to position or pay. They told me I’m still in a probationary period and after that I can be considered for the position, upon which they ended up going and hiring 3 people for the very position I have been asking for over the course of two months. I was very upset every time they told me “oh we hired on another person for this position”.

I am at a loss here, I do more work than the people in that position that I’ve worked with especially the new hires. I’ve even spoken with many co workers who have been with the company for a long time and they all tell me how poorly the company treats their employees in general. The incentive program is terrible and basically pointless, advancement is very slow and biased, the company doesn’t care about their staffing as they treat everyone poorly and all the branches are severely understaffed, the systems are outdated and supplies is lacking.

I’m usually not one to complain about this type of stuff but if I’m not being paid to do other peoples work and clean up their messes, I’m starting to dislike this company. Any advice is welcome and appreciated thanks and sorry for the rant."

I feel like my job is sitting here waiting for people to ask me questions based on my years of knowledge and expertise. My struggle getting started on big projects. I'm happiest when I'm socializing with my colleagues or helping them with something. 

In the meantime, I've started another degree online in Computer Science, which I love. For the past year, I've found myself more excited about doing my homework than my actual work I'm getting paid to do. I just kinda skirt by and put out fires as they come up.

I graduated college 2 years late, as I used to be premed but later switched to economics. I didn’t have internship experience in college, but got one a year after graduating. It was helping a start up in some very basic analyst work using Excel. But didn’t lead directly to a career path. After that I was trying to figure out what in business I wanted to do, trying to study skills, and look for jobs. This was also during the pandemic. About 2 years after my internship, I got a job as an analyst in a marketing agency, where I am now. 

I unfortunately can’t stand this job, or at least this project. It is a lot of manual labor in excel and tedious. It’s a massive audit project that’s pretty tricky and high stakes for a new person, and I’m worried I’ve already messed it up. I would not be able to stand redoing it, nor am I sure if it’s possible to be redone. I also can’t take how much of a mess this place is with their data and work, though I know it could be worse too. Part of me is worried how long I will last here, if I will be able to do the work and last because my new supervisor also doesn’t know anything is struggling too. 

A few people who did this role at this place previously left after 4 months themselves, even if they were on different clients and locations, and probably didn’t have my project.

I’m more interested in finance. I’ve been pushing myself to stay at this job for the sake of my resume, worried about looking bad if I quit so quickly and lack of work experience, but I don’t know how much longer I can stand it, and don’t really have the skills for the kind of job I would want. I’m considering quitting and teaching myself finance skills, maybe do some certificates, and then try to find my way into finance.

That was a few of years ago. I'm now back in town (after moving away for a couple years), and I need a job. Naturally I want that job since I loved it so much, and they have a couple of open positions.

Should I just apply again? Should I reach out to my old boss (who interviewed me the second time)? I have him as a friend on Facebook.

1025,Switching careers?!?,careerguidance,"Hello all, I am currently an Auditor for a State Government. I have a bachelor's degree in Professional Accountancy. Which basically means I can sit for the CPA, otherwise it is equivalent to a Master's degree in Accounting.

I have worked as an auditor in the same state department for almost 8 years. I left for a different department for about 5 months and ended up going back to my old position. That move happened almost 3 years ago.  

I am very interested in switching to the Data Science career path. However, I am trying to determine if I NEED to go back to school. Or can I work my way up? 

I am so bored in my current job. The perks are that it is SUPER flexible. And great work life balance. I just don't know if I can handle working here for another 25 years... (That state pension plan has early retirement at 55). Am I crazy for wanting to switch? Is a career supposed to be fulfilling or is that just the bullshit we've been fed our whole lives."

1028,Educational Assistant with burn out.. where should I go next?,careerguidance,"Ontario,  Canada.

I'm an Educational Assistant with a diploma in Developmental Services. I have worked part time for Agencies in Developmental Services, and also done private respite. I ended up quitting my PT positions when I got FT permanent at the school board I am at.

The pandemic has made me feel totally worthless in my job. I have been in person since the pandemic started even when schools were closed to provide care for kids who couldn't do online. I have been shuffled schools and classes and never really feel like a valuable team member. I get paid the least in the school but do the most hands on work. It's honestly just so draining and not what I signed up for.

I am wondering about other human services sectors. Has anyone worked with mental health interventions? Or in addictions counseling? I would love some insight on careers like this, or any other guidance! Thanks."
1029,Should I apply for an internal job that I’m not ready for?,careerguidance,"Hi all, I’ve been working as a contractor at a company supporting the regulatory team.

I went to school for dietetics and completed my dietetic internship to become a registered dietitian. I entered this job full time right out of the internship and took time off from studying for my exam so I could focus on the start of my career. I am now studying to get my credentials within the next few months. It’s a strenuous exam that I’ve already taken once and did not pass. 

I absolutely love what I do in my current role because it gives me opportunity to learn and grow. It has taken some time for me to develop an understanding of the industry which is why I maintain my contractor support role.

Currently, an entry level internal position is now available within our department and I’m debating on whether I should apply or if I should continue to build my resume. I’ve heard that it looks bad to not apply because it shows that I’m not interested in progressing, but at the same time I feel like I need to get more projects and responsibilities under my belt before I move into this kind of role. I also would love to have my credentials before I enter an internal position as 50% of the team are dietitians.

A fellow contractor and team lead is set up for this open position as she has more experience and has been doing the work that is specifically required for this role. Although I think it’s pretty obvious she may move into this position, I know it would be foolish to not apply because what do I have to lose? But if there is a chance they would consider me, then I would be taking on more responsibility that I’m not sure if I’m ready for.

In the end, I would love to gather more experience and my credentials before moving forward in my career, but I don’t want to be viewed as not interested in an internal job position. Any insight would be helpful. :)"

I have more recently edited (greatly, almost re-writing) a few essays for friends and both were awarded the full scholarship for which they were written. 

In addition to apparently being pretty decent at this, I really do enjoy it and would love to do it more frequently (for compensation). 

I've been an RN for almost a decade and am a musician but I would never consider myself an expert on any specific topic. I don't know if I'd be interested in writing anything that would require research on my part (e.g. grant writing).

1037,"How can I help my wife struggling with losing her mentor, and having a hard time being motivated in her career?",careerguidance,"My wife and I both work at the same company (me approx 5 years / wife approx 10 years). Overall the company has decent pay/benefits and is fairly flexible on working from home, so not complaining on that at all. 

Recently my wife’s department had let’s say a structure change, where her manager is no longer with the company in what some may say was a wrongful termination. My wife’s manager was essentially her mentor and had both worked very closely for her entire time with the company. 

This all happened the week before Christmas, so the impact wasn’t felt or seen as much till now. She called me this morning  on here drive to the office, in tears saying she doesn’t have the motivation and just kind of feels lost and she is afraid she is dropping the ball on tasks, and fears what her future looks like. 

This is her first day in the office since mid Dec. She has been working from home and I have noticed some lack of motivation to work (sleeping later, ending the work day earlier, longer breaks, lack of energy, etc.) but wasn’t to concerned as I felt somewhat the same after a long holiday vacation. 

Looking for a new / better job is an obvious resolution, but I think what scares her the most in doing that is she would be leaving essentially her only professional career she has ever been at. 

Not to mention we are looking at starting a family soon, and our company does have a really good maternity/paternity benefit that most companies don’t offer. Plus she has a ton of unused sick days/vacation days that would not get paid out if she leaves the company. 

Any advice I can share with my wife?"
1038,Resign from current company or stay?,careerguidance,"So my current job at Company A is great! First time I’ve ever enjoyed all the people I work with and all that.

The only downside is asking for support and getting that support. We can’t hire for certain roles that would be better suited for a specialist or even a contractor. Instead we have to wear all hats.

This Company B would not only pay more but it would allow the autonomy to control my path, while allowing me to hire/pull someone in better suited for that specific role instead of me trying to half ass figure it out.

My biggest fear is company A is big and been around, so If let’s say the division I’m in goes away I can move to another area of the company.

Company B is really new (start up) but is backed by a company that makes tons of money and has been around for 30ish years.

I just don’t want to make the wrong decision since I’m the only income for my family but I also want to be happier in a sense that I don’t have to wear all hats and struggle in that realm."

1040,How to move on from being an administrative assistant?,careerguidance,"I am feeling incredible stuck. 28 year old woman working as an admin assistant for a small, creative academic department at a small liberal arts college. I’ve been in my position for almost four years.

I actually really enjoy my job and want to advance in it, but I still feel stagnant. I spoke to my previous department chair about trying to become an “Administrative Coordinator” (the next step up where I work), and about shifting my job from a 10-month position to a 12-month one. She was on board, and even convinced me to stay in my current role when I went about applying to a different position at the college in December of 2020. But now there’s a new department chair (they cycle out every few years at my college), all conversations about those goals have gone silent. I’m being told “thank you” for staying and not switching departments, but no one can tell me anything about how to advance in my current position.

I’m sure it would help if I just sat down and had a frank conversation with the new department chair, but he’s been dealing with some major health issues, and is about to be out for a month for a medical procedure.

I also don’t feel motivated to learn on my own and implement new things into the department if I’m not going to be compensated for it. That said, I should probably just buckle down into my work and really show them what I can do/add to the environment that makes me “coordinator” material.

Anyway! I digress and am just word vomiting now! My big question is, if I do try to move on from this role instead of improving it, what kind of jobs can someone with 5+ years of admin and events experience shift into? Ideally, I’d make at least 50k, would work 40 hours a week, and would also not take work home with me. I’ve looked into Project Coordinator positions, but I don’t feel qualified enough for those. I also recently applied for an Assistant Registrar position at a different University, but also feel under qualified without a masters degree (I only have my bachelors in a creative field).

Others who have worked as admins—what do you do now? What advice do you have? How did you transition out of admin work?! Thank you in advance!"

12/23/2021: 2 hour video interview with Hiring supervisor and manager. 

1/7/2022:  After the holidays we picked this as the best time for a in person interview. Went to meet them in person and discussed again for 2 hours. 

-I felt all the conversations were good and had amazing vibes but now it's been a week with no reply. What's proper way of when and how to reach out to them? 

Also this is a private  company not government located in US. Any advice will help.

I know it’s competitive and they often have someone already in mind, but I would like some feedback on what I could work on to be considered for an interview or for the job. 

What is the best way to ask for candid feedback without being weird about it? Is it ok to reach out to HR or even the hiring manager directly and ask?

1049,How to articulate the decision for leaving a previous field?,careerguidance,"I recently left the counselling field as a therapist and have been applying for different positions. I've mostly been seeking administrative roles (which I have experience in) because I want something with a ""different"" kind of stress than I'm used to. However, I'm not sure what I should be including on my resume or telling interviewers. 

During the most recent interview I had, the interviewer didn't seem to understand why I'd want to leave my position for something like I was interviewing for. I'm wondering if I should be tailoring how I inform future employers why I left the field? I've been telling them I realized it wasn't for me and I'm looking for a change. Is this something to tweak? I'm debating if telling them burnout is the cause instead to 'justify' it?

Since then, I’ve been interviewing for full time roles as well and made it to the final stage interview with another really good company. The recruiter said they can most likely give me 60k. Should I take this position instead?

1053,Should I switch jobs so soon? 31F,careerguidance,"Some background info:
Started my bachelor in biology a long time ago. Got cancer twice during my study but I am graduating next month.

Since June 2021 I have a job at the local government in the Netherlands. I have to verify when farmers ask for permission to expand, and I have to check if they apply to the nature environment laws. It pays good but it is an office job. I can grow further in the company, they are very happy with me. But sitting all day hurts because the cancer damaged nerves in my back.

My boss from my latest internship told me there is a vacancy in an organization that I love. It’s an environmental and educational organization, and they are looking for someone to coordinate the lessons, workshops, markets on a really cool place. It’s an earthship with a huge garden, playground, restaurant, vegetable gardens, and educational centers. I have experience in most of these things. I would do a lot of different things and move around, which is good for my health.

My concerns are, when I switch jobs after 6 months my boss would be very disappointed because they need me.. an they invested in teaching me how to do my job. Also, current job pays much better. The job at the nature organization might be for a few years or longer, but there is also a chance that the building has to be broken down eventually and I might lose that job then. With my current employer I have a big chance to be able to stay as long as I want. But when I leave now, I am not sure if they would hire me back later.  

I am thinking of making an offer to stay for 1 or 2 days a week at my current job to teach newcomers and do some work, because they have a big shortage on people. And work 3 or 4 days at the new job.

Any insight? Would be very much appreciated!"

1057,Should I quit my job? Hate my manager,careerguidance,"I started working at an investment bank mid-last year after I graduated college. Was very excited as this was my first ""real job"". The excitement quickly died down as the weeks went by. Even though I find what I do interesting and like most people in my department, I feel isolated from my own team. The atmosphere is very hostile and not inclusive. Like I even feel scared asking a question now for fear of it being a ""dumb question"". I work remotely most of the time but whenever I ask my supervisor or manager a question through message, sometimes they'll respond quite rudely. My manager in particular has been so mean to me, even to the point of bullying. She shouted at me in front of everyone in our department 3 months into the job (was hugely humiliated) because I signed off on something I shouldn't have (later found out that it wasn't that big of a deal and was an easy fix). She is very unhelpful and whenever I have queries, she just tells me to investigate myself. So, a lot of times I spend hours trying to ""investigate"" when she could have easily just answered my question so that if I have a similar query in the future, I can do it myself. I feel like that has hindered my growth within the role because a lot of times I just tend to ""investigate"" problems myself that I have 0 clue on how to investigate because I was never taught. I have cried several times in the office bathrooms and at home because of her. She often compares me to my supervisor who used to do what I do, but I think it's just unfair as he has years of experience on me. I feel like everything I do is being put under a microscope and if I make a mistake, it is the end of the world. But there have been countless times where she has, my supervisor or other senior people in our team have made similar mistakes but their mistakes don't get the same reaction as mine. I could honestly go on and on about how unhealthy my work-life has become and its starting to take a toll on me mentally

Now, I don't know if I'm overreacting as I don't have much experience and if this is just how things are in the corporate world. I don't know if I should just suck it up and admit that I'm being a nuisance to the whole team by asking questions. I am contemplating finding another job that is more suited for me culturally. It's a shame really because I actually do like the company and the people I've met outside of my team. I'm afraid to talk to my parents about this because they come from a very traditional background and are quite strict. They'll probably tell me to get over it and keep on pushing, but I don't think this job or any job in fact is worth it over my happiness.

I'm a female in my early 20s and I don't plan to work a 9 - 5 job for the rest of my life. I just want to work in the corporate world for a few more years then dip! I want to eventually set up a business that has operations where I'm located currently and my home country. So, should I quit where I'm at currently and find another job?"
1058,"My firm promoted someone whom I, and others, felt did not deserve it. Feeling hurt and betrayed by their decision. Should I seek a new firm or continue to stay at mine?",careerguidance,"I am approaching 8 years at my design firm. This has been my one and only job out of graduate school and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I believe our work is strong, creative, and I’m lucky to work with high-end clientele that allows freedom of design, despite any budgets. I live about 7 minutes from work, go to the gym during my lunch, and overall have a decent work/life balance. I’m also very close to the partner (there are 3), whose team I am on, as well as one of the major project managers here, who we will call Sam.

In the last year or so I have tried to take myself to the next level and have increasingly spent more time out of business hours to do extra work at home or on the weekends. This is due to the 37% increase in salary I received last year. The reason for such a major bump in pay is because I discovered I was being underpaid compared to colleagues in the same firm with similar level of skill, and so I sought out other offers. To my surprise, there was somewhat of a bidding war from a couple firms to get my employment. I approached my firm with a two-week notice, and they responded by giving me a salary that no firm had yet to offer me. And the truth is, of all the firms I applied to, the one I am currently at has my favorite work in terms of design and is closest to home. So, I really wanted to stay here, and with the bump in salary I chose to do just that. 

My boss made it clear that with that salary bump I am now at the associate/junior partner level in terms of salary. To assure them that they made the right decision in giving me that pay, I really busted my ass this last year. Like I said, working extra hours at home or on the weekend and just being better at managing consultants and the rest of the team. I thought I was doing great.

Then yesterday, my boss pulls me in to a private office to tell me that the firm is promoting two new people to junior partner. One person, Sam from the first paragraph, 100% percent deserves it as he is the backbone of that firm. He busts his ass more than anyone I’ve ever seen and is a great mentor. The other person they chose, lets call her Kat, made me feel like I got stabbed in the back. Kat has been here a shorter time than I and we both have very similar skill level. Sure, she may be a bit better at design but at the same time I am better at technical drawings and managing teams and projects. This comes from Sam, who manages and works closely with both of us. Sam felt I deserved the promotion over Kat. 

Upon hearing this news, my boss could tell I was visibly upset, even thru my mask, due to my body language. He said I was very close to being chosen and still am, but I know the truth and that’s that these types of decisions come across once every 5-8 years and so I don’t feel very close at all. I think he just said that to make me feel better. He said he hopes this news doesn’t affect my attitude and that I continue to push extra hard. Yeah, ok. Kat is a strict 8-5 person, whereas I put in extra time. What’s the motivation to continue doing that if someone who pulls the minimum is getting promoted to junior partner?

I think even my boss felt I deserved it more, but it seems the decision to choose Kat over me came above him and from the other 2 partners of the firm. I think this is also because the other two partners sit near Kat whereas I’m on the other side. They never see me leave with my laptop to go work extra at home or see the work I produced over a weekend.

Anyways, I just don’t know what to do. I feel hurt and let down after all that I’ve done for this firm. I actually had lunch last week with a partner from a competing firm who said their offer is still on the table and they’d make it worth my while. I want to say fuck you to my firm and take my talents elsewhere but I know right now I’m thinking with emotion and need time for clarity. 

Just looking for general advice and guidance how to continue forward. If I should start looking for employment elsewhere after feeling betrayed. I’d be happy to provide additional information if needed."

- He would always laugh at anything someone at the company said if the person was above him. For example, if a VP walked by him and said anything where he/she was trying to be funny he would laugh loudly for about 10 seconds.


- He always tried to talk to Executives or people that where multiple levels above him. For example,  he would try to add the Executives on his Facebook.

- Basically he was ever in a meeting with someone above him he would always be outspoken towards them and agree with what they say if that makes sense. For example, pretend im an Executive and say ""I believe the numbers in this report are off"". He would respond with about a minute long response saying how he agrees with me, tell me I have good ideas, and laugh depending on if there's anything humorous about what I'm saying."

Maybe Application Support Analysts just don't have much room for growth? He seemed to apply to other jobs in the company too but never got them."

1067,PwC Audit Summer Internship offer - should I cancel other audit internship applications?,careerguidance,"I'm a 2nd (penultimate) year university student from the UK and I've been applying to summer internships. I got an offer from PwC to do an audit internship this summer (yay). The other companies I applied to (and didn't get rejected from yet) for audit are Tilney Smith and Williamson, KPMG and BDO. I've applied for other internships too, mainly in actuarial, since I'm interested in becoming an actuary. However I'm not sure what job I want to do after uni - hopefully doing an internship will help me decide.

I have an assessment centre with Tilney Smith and Williamson on the 24th-25th January. My question is, since I already received an offer from PwC for audit, should I cancel this assessment centre? A PwC internship is better than a Tilney Smith and Williamson one, right? Also, my uni is really slow with finalising the timetable, so I may have to miss a lecture in order to make the assessment centre. And if KPMG or BDO offer me assessment centres should I cancel them too? 

I'm still planning to keep applying for actuarial internships. I've applied and not been rejected from Aon, Legal &amp; General, Isio, AIG, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson, so I'm going to see if I get any offers from those, because I think I'd rather do an actuarial internship than an audit one (not sure though). Are some of these internships worse options than the PwC audit internship?

1069,Do you need experience alongside a new coding certification to be offered a job?,careerguidance,Someone I know is thinking about getting a certification but can't afford to quit his job for internship experience. Is it relatively likely he will be offered a job with just a certification or is experience required to make it in the game. He is fairly late in the game and around his 30s but wants to break out of the loop he's in.

1073,Can someone please help me with reasoning about a job opportunity?,careerguidance,"Hello,

I got a contract suggestion from another company. The pay is 9% better, the days off are increased from 20 to 30, mobile and computer on work. Probitionairy time is 6months.

Anyway, I grown complacent here at my job. Im still on probation, but that will end in March. I am also thinking that having a permanent employment looks great in my resume. 
I have a 1 to 1 with my boss tomorrow.

I'm a pseudo-freshly graduate from college (2020), I have experience in doing what I do. But it takes some time to learn something new. The job is in the same field.

Basically, should I give up ~10% raise because I know the job, the people, know how to do stuff etc. Or should I switch?"
1074,Am I too much of a generalist?,careerguidance,"Hi,

I'm a 24 year old who graduated college a little over a year ago with a degree in math and minor in computer science and landed a job at an AI-based software SaaS startup. I was employee #23. I've been there ever since and function as a kind of chief of staff to the CEO. In my role I wear a ton of hats -- marketing, finance, strategy, investor relations. It's been great in that I've been at the right hand of the leader of a growing company and get to see a lot of different areas of the company. The coolest thing I've done is raise venture capital money -- I made the pitch decks, was involved in every presentation to potential investors, and worked through negotiation and closing on our Series A. Ever since then I've been helping spend the money. My boss is kind of an absent minded professor type, whereas I am very detail oriented and keep track of things well, which is why he likes to involve me in as much as possible. However, although I'm paid well and enjoy my job, I fear that I'm too much of a generalist and wonder if this will hinder me down the road in my next job hunt. It's not like I'm a software engineer or product person or finance person... should I try to pivot in one of those directions? Is it bad that I'm acting in this generalist function? I enjoy it specifically because I'm a generalist by nature - but it seems like that may not be the way to go in the long run.

I'm not into software engineering - never worked as a SWE but never appealed to me. (I hated those leetcode challenges!) I'm taking a finance course on the side which my job is paying for to beef up my knowledge there. Still, wondering what I should aim at."

1076,"I want better benefits. Should I leave my current job that I love, for a job I dont have much interest in, but has great benefits?",careerguidance,"Living in the US here. Apologies for the long post and for my rant.. I'm very stressed out and anxious. I have a job in which the work generally interests and excites me (I work in a biology lab with bacteria and viruses). I would say our benefits are decent to good. We recently switched health insurance a year ago. 

A bit of a tangent, but explains the situation. I have a chronic disease that will require expensive procedures in the future. The health plan itself is probably good compared to most others out there, as it is currently covering my very expensive medication. But the health insurance company itself is notorious for denying claims left and right - You might know which one I'm talking about. I have not had any major issues with them yet (probably because I've not needed anything expensive done yet), but have already had several small issues that are driving me insane. I have spent the last 6 months fighting them over a denied claim and I'm exhausted - they are 100% in the wrong, no question. Needless to say, thinking about managing my disease in the future through this company sends me into spiraling anxiety, when actual expensive procedures will be needed and they decide to deny another one. There is potential that the health insurance company could switch next year, but we don't know yet.  This was my sole reason for wanting to get a new job. To get better health insurance. The only way I thought I could get guaranteed good health insurance is to get a state/federal job. 

I didn't expect to stay at my current job forever, but I didn't expect myself to want to leave so soon either. I don't know if I am being petty about the health insurance thing. But I've been extremely stressed for the past month about this denied claim.  My problems with my current health insurance are all hypothetical future situations. I have anxiety so I tend to stress about things before they are even a real problem/I try to be proactive if I can. Nothing that horrible has happened with them yet. But living with a chronic disease, I can't help but think about how these expensive procedures are gonna go in the future. Sorry, I probably sound like a nut.

Anyway, I recently found a state job that I qualify for. Great health insurance and other benefits, and would likely be a decent pay increase as well. Only thing is, I am not interested in the work itself. At least, on paper it doesn't seem as interesting. Maybe once i am there and doing the job, I would end up liking it more. It's a chemist job. I love biology, not chemistry. I dont think I would hate it, but I am much more interested in my current line of work. It's basically a matter of do give up doing what I have lots of interest in, for better pay, benefits, and overall better job security?

To sum up, here are the pros and cons:

Current job:

\+ Interested and excited by the work

\+ Good pay for relatively little work (lots of slow days)

\+ Flexible ability to work from home

\- Bad health insurance company

\- Company recently merged with another, so lots of changes and uncertainty. I am not worried about being laid off or anything, as my job is pretty essential, but there is lots of uncertainty about the overall future of the direction of the company

&amp;#x200B;

Potential new job: 

\+ Great health insurance, pension, other benefits

\+ Likely a good pay increase

\- Not as interested in the work

\- Location is less ideal (I dont like the route I would have to take every day, but it's doable)

\- No ability to work from home

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't even apply to this new job yet, so theres a chance I won't even get it. But generally speaking, state lab jobs in my area are rare to come by. So I feel like if I decide I want to leave my job, I need to try to take this position as it might be years before I see another similar position"

1080,Is it time to move on with minimal career experience?,careerguidance,"I graduated college at the end of 2018 with two BS analytic/math/econ related degrees in hopes to become an analyst related to business practice or financial optimization. Since then I have had a job (1yr) that worked with analytics indirectly and I moved up to management within that time, dealing more with people than analytics, so I moved on to a more directly related analytic job as an entry level Financial Analyst for a bank and I’ve had that now almost 2 years. 

I have not received a real raise/promotion within that time (only the yearly 3% raise), now being 3 years out of college still at an “entry level” position. I know salary advancement happens quicker after moving companies, but I don’t know if I have enough real, directly-related work experience to get a real financial gain. My workload and knowledge has significantly improved since I started, so I do think I’m bringing more to the table than someone directly out of college. 

Should I stay another year and see if it improves? Or look elsewhere?"

Longer Version (sorry if it’s too long or if I’m rambling): I’m graduating Highschool this year, still have no idea what I wanna do. If I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m a people pleaser. I’m pretty much the opposite of confrontational. I’m also a pretty lazy dude (at least for the last couple of years when it comes to school, being in lockdown/quarantine completely obliterated my work ethic). I don’t have any outstanding skills. My hobbies are just basketball and video games, and I’ve thought about trying to go into a career in either, in many different forms (for example, commentary and analysis for basketball, development and streaming for video games), but I strongly feel that I want to keep those hobbies as just hobbies. I don’t think I’ll enjoy them as jobs. Some careers I’ve been considering are Dental hygiene, Medical Sonography, and looked into trade school as well. I guess these would be my “safe” options because they have good money, reliability, and employability, but beyond that, I’m not really into in them. Recently I’ve also been looking into commercial diving, because it genuinely piqued my interest. The idea of working and exploring underwater seems so fascinating to me. Doing some more research though I don’t think the lifestyle is for me. From what I’ve read and seen, it’s a lot of travel, exhaustion, and the work is inconsistent. On top of that, I’m not really a good swimmer, only know basics. If it matters at all, right now I have a part time job at a pizza place as a dishwasher/inside help. It’s my first job and I actually find it decently fun to be honest. Washing the dishes is ok. Taking orders on the phone and talking to customers is surprisingly enjoyable for me, even though I can be pretty awkward. I guess that’s pretty much it. Any advice or criticism or whatever would be helpful, thanks for reading."

1084,Post-Grad: Should I stay remote?,careerguidance,"Hey everyone, I'm 6 months into my first post grad job as a ERP consultant. I want to pivot out of my current consultant position to a internal analyst position down the line by the end of the year. 

With that being said, my company keeps pushing back the move in date for the office and I really don't know if I want to move states after a whole year of working. The company has a GREAT remote culture, I've had no trouble networking or asking for help from anybody. I also know for a fact that being remote won't affect my growth opportunities internally.

However,  certain mentors outside of work recommend I move to the office so I can network with my managers and if the job doesn't let me move or if the job turns to shit, I can go get another job in the bigger city (which is a huge tech hub).

I personally wanted to move to a city closer to home that has good job opportunities and stay remote but visit my company headquarters every quarter. I also produce music in my free time which gives me the most fulfillment regardless of money, and all the artists with potential that I work with live in my current home state. And the new state doesn't have a good scene for the music I make. 

I feel like I will miss the freedom of being remote in my home state but I'm worried that I'm delaying my career development and just living in a fairy tale world. Currently I can do anything I want to do, I'm paranoid it won't last.

 I’ve recently found a real passion in performating arts especially acting, singing, guitar and piano. The thing is that I didn’t learned any of those things when I was a kid I wanted to know if there was any major in university where I could learn those thing so I could actually lean what I like and gain the experience to work in those fields. I’d also like to specify that my grades been really bad since I entered college and even before so my academic record is not good. 

Considering that my academic record isn’t good and that I also don’t have any experience in performative arts ( except what I self learned so far ) I wanted to know if there was somewhere I could go to form myself during those next months to get the required level to apply to this major.

1092,What's the secret to a promotion and moving up the corporate ladder? What do you talk about in your 1-on-1's?,careerguidance,"I'm about to enter a new career opportunity soon, but before I do, I wanted to give my current industry one more shot. So even though I have a job lined up a couple months from now, I thought I would take the remaining time I have left to eek out a job hop. That being said, while it's unlikely that I would get promoted in such a short amount of time, I've always had a natural knack and inclination for knowing right away once I do the job if I would like it, has promotion material and upward social mobility. The reason I know this is because of the on-boarding process. If the role or opportunity can't even on-board you properly, and it's just a go shadow this employee, that employee, you can generally assume that your role is simple-minded and not challenging. This has been my experience. 

  
That being said, what is the secret to getting promotions and moving up the social corporate ladder? is it a combination of many factors? Such as excelling in your role, but also utilizing the 1-on-1's with your manager to let them know? I've always thought that if they wanted to promote me, they should come find me. But I was speaking to a former mentor, and she mentioned one of the ways that she was quickly able to get a promotion almost yearly was to right away make a 30-60-90 day game plan with her supervisor/director and talk about the things necessary she needed to learn, build, so that she could approach that next level.   


it didn't even occur to me that 1-on-1's were utilized in this way, but now that I think about it, it does seem smart. Many of my 1-on-1's were used to talk about my feelings, a recap of what I did that week, and things I want to do. But never once did I mention that I wanted to be promoted. Was this my mistake?"

The majority of my coworkers have opted to continue working from home, including all of the members of my immediate team. I’ve noticed that when I go into the office, no one is there for me to collaborate with and there is absolutely no reason for me to be there. I feel more efficient when I’m at home, and quite honestly, feel anxious and out of place when I’m in the office.

I was a software developer at this company. Now that I am thinking of switching back to tech, this company has the only marketable experience for the roles I am looking for.

I am writing to see if anyone on here has any ideas of what industry or job would be a good place for me to transition out of teaching ideally 2 years from now. I'll first give my background/ story then say what I am looking for from my work then the ideas I have. I am hoping that people can say X job sounds good for you from what you said OR Y job sounds like it wouldn't be a good fit. 

I have gotten so lost in this thought process I don't feel objective anymore- help, please!

My Background:

I am from the US with a bachelor's degree in evolutionary biology and ecology and a teaching certificate for high school biology and chemistry. I have been working as a teacher in international schools for the past 3 years in Europe and just signed a contract to teach for 2 more years at another international school in Africa which I am very excited about. I am mainly excited because of the location and how cool of an experience it will be. However, I am bored out of my mind at my job. I love teaching because I genuinely enjoy spending time with teenagers but it is not my calling (you know how some teachers are like ""teaching is my calling and makes me feel so fulfilled etc""- that is not me). Specifically, I struggle at my current school because we have no opportunity to develop our own lessons so it's a rather robotic environment. The next school isn't like that. I find teaching very emotionally exhausting but I don't feel like it is mentally challenging enough (I don't mean to sound like a turd). I really miss having to think really hard about things. At my job, now that I have done it for 3 years, I feel like it's easy, a lot of work but easy work. Before I went into teaching I worked in research but didn't like it because it was too isolated for me (worked in a lab and basically never saw anyone else).

The short version of the above:

Things I like about teaching- getting to know students, sharing my love of science, vacation days, how active of an environment it is, getting to see kids ""ah-ha moments""

Things I don't like about teaching- very rigid schedule, no real opportunity for growth aside from admin which I don't see for myself, teaching the same class year after year is already getting boring, all of the dumb babysitting/paperwork/busy work teachers are forced to do, work is not very mentally stimulating

What I am looking for:

After this move to Africa, I would like to settle down in Europe (work visa etc is not a problem)

I am looking for a job that is: well-paid, flexible working hours, mentally challenging/interesting, opportunity for growth/ different skills, preferably something that does good for the world and is something that I can translate my current skills into.

Industries/job positions I am considering:

1. Cognitive Science- very interested in this and spend a lot of free time reading about it but I worry about being in academia/ being in a lab again because I hated that. What other work can cognitive scientists do?
2. Data Analyst- kind of out of left field but when I was in college I took and then TA'd a couple of classes in Rstudio and LOVED it. I've been refreshing my skills on data camp and have really enjoyed the problem-solving side of it. I also think my teaching skills would enable me to present data in an understandable way to non-experts. I worry this too will be too isolating but I don't know too much about the day-to-day work of a data analyst.
3. Curriculum Development- seems like an obvious next choice for a teacher but I'm not sure what this job would actually look like
4. Psychologist- also kind of random but I think I would focus on adolescents then my teaching background could be very helpful.

I am completely open to other ideas! 

I am just trying to plan a few years out so when the time comes I am prepared and have been working towards what I want for my next step.

Thanks for reading!!

1118,Should I go back to University at my age?,careerguidance,"I(32f) am in a very well paying job, and running a really good side business. Yet I was very unsuccessful and in students debt of nearly 80k about 4 years ago. I barely passed my BSc with a third class degree, did slightly better in my MSc. But then didn’t work hard enough for a scientific career, that I truly wanted. Throughout my 5years university life I spent nearly every day, either depressed, sleeping, malnourished, crying, confused, lying and just not knowing how to function. Never really made friends with my classmates. Because I missed 90% of my classes. 

I have some fond memories of studying alone and spending time in the library. But that was like 10% of total time. 

Today I am debt free, awake, in a core engineering discipline, self aware, happy, healthy, a bit indisciplined but nothing like what I was 10 years ago. 

After all this time my biggest regret my regret is that I didn’t study freely when I had the chance to. 

I love science and want to do it truly in a PhD now. People don’t know how I missed most of my uni experience and they think I learned all this in uni. Which isn’t true. I learned all this in self learning when I was jobless and friendless. But this time around I want to immerse myself in a sophisticated university experience, study , get up and go to class and live my dream of studying science and becoming a scientist. I am at a stage in life where I don’t have to wait for any opportunity, I can comfortably pay for my PhD or join an unpaid program. I just want to know if it’s worth it."

1126,How to expand on my career As an allied health professional (Orthoptist)?,careerguidance,"I’m currently working as an Orthoptist in Australia and I’m interested in picking up a master’s degree to further expand on my career. I enjoy what I do currently but I feel like I’m still definitely not satisfied. I’m interested in possibly getting an MHA/MBA and working in a multidisciplinary practice or even hospital, through jobs such as project management. I’ve seen so many different types of jobs that interest me like clinical trial work, etc, but I’m unsure what’s a good pathway for me as although I’m an allied health professional, I’m no nurse or PT and don’t have experience in that kind of setting. I’d like some advice as I’m clueless on how to even begin researching on what to do. For some context, I still want to remain in a more clinical setting rather than just pure admin work, but I was wondering if my experience purely within the optical field is limiting me. I’m definitely okay with moving into other areas of healthcare - if it helps, I also dabbled a bit in pre-med but didn’t want to proceed as a doctor (kind of regret my choice considering how I now know there’s so many other things I could’ve done with medicine)"

1130,How do you think about compensation working remotely in HCOL area?,careerguidance,"With the rise of remote work, it's pretty clear that there are many people moving from HCOL to LCOL areas. I'm in the opposite situation.

I live in a very HCOL area. I moved here for a job headquartered here before COVID. I've since moved to a new company where the vast majority of the employees are remote. There is no requirement on location, we even have people in different continents. However, the company's salary range is agnostic  of location (and it's not that wide). Many of my colleagues have moved from HCOL to LCOL areas and kept the same salary. 

For me, I want to stay here because my life is here (friends, family, things I enjoy, etc.).

I can see arguments for both sides. On one hand, a person living in LCOL might argue that they should be paid the same because that's what they're worth regardless of location. On the other hand (my situation), my company can't keep up with the HCOL salary levels. 

It seems to me that the conclusion is either: (1) the company is forcing me to move to LCOL area or (2) the company wants me to quit so they can replace me with someone willing to take a lower salary. So do I just have to quit and find a job that has a requirement to be in my area and paying the HCOL salary? That would suck because I like my current company."

I have my own house and a good job as a software contractor. I have savings and investments and don’t struggle month to month like I used to and managed to pay of a large sum of debt a year ago or so. About £16000.

This isn’t a bragging post. For the last year I’ve genuinely lost my desire to do what I used to love. I know it’s rare for people to find a job that pays well but also doesn’t feel like work. But now it just feels like work.

I don’t know what to do and it’s soul destroying. I feel like I’ve hit a brick wall in life. I used to set goals all the time and now I don’t know what to do next. Any new idea or job change I come up with I just think to myself that’s great but how will you make ends meet and I’ll be starting from scratch again or what if I get bored 3 months in and I’m back to square one.

1137,Stay in Research/Hard Science or Switch to Medicine?,careerguidance,"I posted this a week or so ago, but it was pretty long and I didn't get any responses, so let me shorten it up.

I'm working at a national lab in research/hard science.  I don't really find it fulfilling.  While I like the day to day and it's extremely flexible (which is fantastic), I really don't see the big picture and I'm not in love with it as a whole.

I've never thought of myself as getting higher-than-average enjoyment out of helping people, but I know for sure that my current work is just way too out of touch.  I'd like to be able to make a tangible difference in people's lives, and I'd like to be able to see it.  More than that, some events in my life have hugely impacted my relationship with ""institutional medicine,"" and I feel that it has seriously hurt me.  I think pursuing medicine would give me an opportunity at many levels to *be the change*.

I'm concerned that medicine is a huge commitment of work and time, and medicine can take away from other parts of one's life.  In particular, I'd like to have a family someday and I enjoy the outdoors.  Some med students, residents, and fully-fledged doctors say that they don't have time for any of these things, and that scares me.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?  I know that I can't stay here—that is, I can't stay here in research.  It's too detached from what I value and I can't find the motivation to give it my best.  All that said, should I be looking at medicine or something else?"

So I have been trying to get into PA school since about 2017, but I've only been waitlisted with nothing else. The more I think about it, the more I know I want to help people with mental health issues. But I was wondering if I can somehow do one of these two job ideas:

1. I want to help people with transitioning and even doing body modifications. I want to essentially combine plastic surgery and psychiatry and dermatology. So I was thinking of becoming a NP if I finish up a BSN and then matriculate into a DNP program, or going full on into medical school and specialize in 3 areas so I can combine them. I'm unsure though.

2. I was also thinking of somehow being able to study stem cell research so we can start learning how to 3D print genitalia for people to essentially transition with more options out there for them and better results. I don't really know how I can do this though at all.

I have been lookin for jobs lately and not finding much and losing hope.

I don't mind grinding all day and take pride in my pipeline management of constant follow up. Honestly B2C is likely best but I could do B2B for sure if not too technical. 

The problem is I don't have any experience in SAAS OR B2B . I know a lot of you will look down on this and I get it.

My question is does anyone know of any sales roles like I am describing? I understand I likely cant make 6 figures but being in the Bay Area I would like to make around 80k if possible due to the extremely high cost of living.

I have an accounting degree and have been working in a mundane mediocre job. Don't want to stay in accounting and have always thought about being a police officer as well as joining the Navy. I'm 27 going on 28 so don't really have time to try out both since I want to get my career established. I have passed backgrounds with a very large well paid department in the Southwest that will have a academy late spring/early summer. I'm also waiting to see if I get picked up for Navy OCS to be a Supply Officer (also applied for SWO).

With the police I would like to stay in for a career and get into some investigative unit or later on join the Feds. With the Navy I will probably just do my 4 years and then use the GI Bill to get a masters like a MBA and work corporate management, consulting or join a nonprofit.

I find police work intriguing, I want to go out be involved in my community, help those in need, and fight crime. On the other hand being a Navy Officer seems like a once in a lifetime experience to see the world, test myself, lead others, and gain experience to set me up for the rest of my life.

I'm 26yo, and I've been in the workforce after university for 3 years. I have two Bachelor's degrees (a business + comp sci dual degree program offered at my university).

I had some relevant-to-school work experiences while in university, and was hired as a data analyst at  a public institution that manages healthcare data,  and 7+ clinic locations at different buildings, collaborating with hospitals and government on making healthcare more efficient and accessible. I was hired at ~50k salary with strong benefits/vacation/pension. 

Our IT department quit shortly after I joined, so I took over it all (3 positions). We've amalgamated and added more locations in multiple cities, changed processes and infrastructure, user hardware changes, developed workflows and training classes, etc. 

The pandemic made it much more busy. I work a ton of unpaid overtime that I'm allowed to take off work to balance out later, but I feel like I'm burning out. We've outsourced certain things, and now I've been managing a group of people while being the head of IT, and juggling the data analyst job i was hired for.

I'm a hard worker and get constant praise. But I haven't had a raise this whole time. It feels a bit insulting, but I also am bad at standing up for myself sometimes.

My boss and team are great to work with, and I don't want to leave.. but I might. I haven't applied to many places, but I've interviewed for a handful of positions  that pay 80-90k with similar benefits, which I'm qualified for.

I mainly want to switch because I want to make more impact in the companies I work for.

Currently the majority of my job is data entry with really little requirement for thinking or analysis. Even though I am really well compensated with above average pay, I can't see myself working this job forever and I don't really see any upwards mobility so I just want to take a leap into finance jobs that require more analysis or help with decision making.

I am unsure how to do this or even what to write on my resume as I don't really have any ""relevant"" job experience and I don't really know what I can write that would relate to any sort of analysis in my current (and former) jobs.

Here are some other details about myself:

* I have a bachelors degree in accounting (average GPA - don't remember exact numbers)
* I've been working as in Accounts Payable for nearly 4 years (hopped companies 3 times)
* Live and work in Toronto Canada
* My interests in Finance mainly comes from looking at data, financial statements (&amp;) analysis and making financial decisions related to DCFs, NPVs, etc.
* I do have a good grasp of excel skills and wouldn't mind learning more. I find excel fun and an extremely useful tool for data
* Ideally the job is WFH, but this isn't really of top priority for me

Summary

* What jobs should I look into from my interests in finance above?
* How do I write my resume that would relate my AP skills with it? (I can't really think of much b/c most of my current job is just data entry... I do the occasional month end reports to ensure balancing, but nothing else)

1179,Do you think 9 to 5 work is obsolete?,careerguidance,"I do. 

9 to 5 was invented for and made sense when people needed to clock in for factory work and we didn’t have the technology to have rotating schedules.

Now, most jobs are on a “work when you have energy” basis. For those that still require a schedule of sorts, we have modern scheduling systems where to a certain degree you can choose your own hours that suit you.

E.g. I’m a morning person, very productive in the morning but not productive in the afternoon, so I choose to work 7-1. And then only work in the afternoon if necessary.

So I’ve been in my current role for 1.5 years. I am in a development program at my company and it is customary for most in this program to switch jobs every 2 years. After ~6 years in the program you are supposed to exit and get a managerial role. 

I’m scheduled to move to a new team in June. The company has already laid this all out and everything is in place for me to do this. Higher ups have approved all of the scheduled rotations as well. However, my manager doesn’t seem too happy about all of this. She reached out to me today asking me to stay on the team another 6-12 months. 

I don’t want to do this. I want to rotate to a new team in 6 months. How do I tell my manager I’m not interested in doing this while still keeping the peace in my role for the next 6 months? I don’t hate my job now, I’m just getting bored and I’m not interested in staying. 

I could say yes, let her battle it out with the higher ups and they may potentially tell her no. But then there’s a possibility they say yes to her and I get stuck on this team longer. I think this would be a bad move for my longer term career plans.

1189,"Should I Stay or Should I Go, Now?",careerguidance,"TL;DR: Keep teaching for a year or two to get through a busy patch of life, or bet the farm on switching careers now?

&amp;#x200B;

Be me. Public high school teacher. Nearing 40, with 10 years experience in various teaching roles. Beyond burned out - natural introvert, frustrated with broken system, etc. Looking to switch to another career. Sole earner for family of 4 (mortgage, etc), so no room to fuck up my source of income or take a pay cut (currently 60k + good benefits/insurance). Because reasons, I drive an hour+ each way to teach at a school that is lightyears better than anywhere in my immediate vicinity. Even so, I can always be home before 5:00, which is nice. I'm definitely in a mental health slump from the stress of teaching, but I have the terminator-like personality who can knuckle down and eat a bowl of hot nails for breakfast every day if that's what absolutely needs to be done. And right now, it does. 

Find out about coding jobs. Begin a couple months of self teaching online. Loving it so far, but very aware that I don't really know what a tech career would really be like for me. Willing to give it a shot if given the opportunity, but bootcamps are expensive and time consuming. Even self learning - if done properly - is a monumental investment of time before becoming employable at a level that will pay the bills, let alone allow me to advance.

ALSO - Life is busy as shit. Two toddlers, one in pre-school, other one going next year. Wife stays home with them during the day (even if she worked, we'd have to pay for daycare, plus, you know, pandemic), but also takes care of her very frail 92yo grandma at a nearby independent living facility every night as soon as I get home. Granny may drop tomorrow, or hang on for another year. Until then, the minute I get home each afternoon, I'm on parent duty by myself while wife helps grandma. It's a valuable cause, and my wife is irreplaceable in grandma's life. It must and should be this way for now. It's just busy. Wife also works weekend days at a farm stand, which serves as both a mental break for her from full time single-parenting while I'm at work, as well as a modest amount of extra income for the family. Again, a worthwhile arrangement for all parties concerned, just busy. We're both going full tilt every single day and doing our god-damnedest to keep up with it. 

Suffice it to say that there is no extra time. Every minute of every day is spoken for. If I'm lucky, I can squeeze in one hour of coding practice on my own each day (currently learning Python, but also looking into html/css/javascript). I feel like at this pace, it will take me forever and a day to become qualified for a coding job. Even with summer vacation, I can't afford the time to go through a 4-6 month full-time bootcamp while not being paid. I'm locked into working full time for now, but I don't even have the time to do a part-time bootcamp after hours. Even if I spend the entire summer vacation (only 2 months, really) self-studying, I feel like that's not going to make me job-ready any time soon. 

THE QUESTION(s):

Should I even bother using my one and only hour of time in each day just to scratch the surface of coding, or should I just wait until I have more time (i.e. kids are both in school, and/or grandma finally dies)? It would make my day-to-day life just a bit more livable if I have a tiny bit of breathing room, but I'd hate feeling like I'm giving up on, or at least postponing, an important long-term goal.

Should I try to get a job, *any* job, to get me out of the classroom, as long as it can at least match my current modest income? The job market is on fire right now, and if I wait until summer, I'll be competing with thousands of other teachers doing exactly the same thing. I'm aware that my teaching job currently affords me an earlier schedule with more frequent holidays than almost any corporate job. I worry that I might jump out of the frying pan and into the fire if I get another job (even a remote one) that actually requires a full 8 hours of work, and later in the day, which cuts into my family's current schedule. Also, I basically can't get fired from teaching right now - there's no such guarantee in the private sector. We have a couple month's worth of savings, but I cannot afford to lose my income at any time for any reason. 

Will coding jobs be a better work/life balance with job security, or am I setting myself up to just burn out again in another industry? What role should I even aim for in order to maximize my ability to at least enter the field? Web Dev? Front-end/back-end/fullstack? SWE? I have an unrelated master's degree and no formal CS training, but I'm relatively tech savvy and a quick learner. Are bootcamps even worth it? How realistic is it for a busy parent/teacher to self-teach coding to an employable level? How much time will I have to commit, and how the hell do I pay the bills in the meantime if neither my wife or I have the time for a full time job?

For some reason, I feel like whatever path I choose, I need to commit to it NOW. I can't afford to waste my time, and I need to do something, anything, to make life just a tiny bit more livable and have a clearer plan for a better future.

Whew. Maybe I just needed to vent this all out in order to make sense of it myself. Thanks for reading this far. Your insights will be appreciated more than you know."
1190,"Options for someone with a lot of interpersonal skills, but only some college?",careerguidance,"Hello everyone,

I am currently working a production job for very basic pay that I can't stand and honestly, I only took because it paid a little bit more. 

 I'm 28 and have a bit of college (44 credit hours) before I realized it just wasn't for me. I was prior navy and after I got out, I had been doing random jobs as they come along.  I tried to sell cars, but the absolute dishonesty and pressuring of people to make a sale really didn't sit right for me. 

After that I began security work, mostly unarmed.  The aspects of the job that I loved were directing and helping people, as well as customer service and communications with customers.  I just love being able to stand in front of a random person and have them go from frowning to smiling in just a few minutes.

From security I actually ended up getting hired at a hotel as a front desk representative and absolutely loved it.  I got nothing but good reviews and ended up as a team lead in about a month.  When the computer system wasn't crashing and the rest of the staff actually did their jobs it was just an enjoyable gig.  I ended up leaving for reasons I can't really get into, but the low pay was part of it. I honestly miss a lot about the job.

I am In the current position I'm in because a relative ""helped"" me get a job at his factory that has ended up being the worst job I have ever worked.  If the pay wasn't okay I'd be long gone.

My question is (sorry for the long intro),  I am really just ready to find a career that I can develop long term skills in. I absolutely loved hospitality and I don't really have the means to go to college again.  What sort of careers or certification is out there for someone who loves customer relations, and customer accommodations? 

I'm not trying to make six figures, I'd be happy with 45 to 50k at this point.  I just am drawing blanks and have no idea where to start. 

 I am sorry if that's super broad stroke.  

Thank you all in advance for your answers."

1193,Stuck in life at 28. No degree. The things I want to do don’t pay the bills. Any career advice?,careerguidance,"So I’m currently floundering in life. I’ve been jumping from call center to call center since 2014. I’m burnt out and can’t do it anymore. 

I’ve always been directionless. I’d stay in my current role until it became too much or more money came along. 

I’ve worked in call centers for a major cable company, I did a year of help desk/IT support, and now I currently do loans at a credit union. 

Different hats, but all on the phones and I’m burnt out and disappointed in myself for not making more of my life. 

Right now I make $34k a year which is really not where I want to be. I want to be $45k-$50k at this age. 

My dilemma is this - if I don’t care about something I just legitimately don’t give a shit about it and I can’t force myself to care. It’s why I burn out at all my jobs.

The thing I really love is writing. Self-published 4 books with a 5th on the way. I love talking about my hobbies (video games, movies) in writing. So I’ve looked at journalism jobs, etc but there’s just not many and it’s not worth going into debt for an English degree hoping I can land one. And full time novelists are even more rare. 

I’m married and have a mortgage so going back to school full time isn’t an option. 

Right now I’m worried to pull the trigger on anything. I have severe anxiety as well which makes committing to any of these paths even harder. 

I could go back into IT (although I let my certification lapse) but I feel like that’s a step back. I don’t think I can do any more customer service. 8 years is just too much. I’m done. 

I’ve looked at accounting. Great pay. But from what I understand lots of OT and you need a degree. I know a few people who do it and they don’t regret it but I honestly don’t know if I could bring myself to care enough to go through 4 years of school for it. 

I’m not even sure what else to consider. An English degree looks like a waste of time and money. If anyone can make any suggestions I’m all ears. I’ve floundered long enough and would really like to work towards a long term solution and goal. 

I’ve tried aptitude tests and the like and they all recommend creative endeavors like novelist, screenwriter, etc and while that sounds great the odds aren’t in my favor to actually land something like that. 

Anyone got any suggestions? 

Thanks for reading."
1194,"How much of a problem is ""jumpiness"", changing jobs frequently, if it is very clear that each new job is better than the previous?",careerguidance,"Some context. I'm in my late 20s, from Europe, with 6 years of specialised experience in a very hot field in regulatory &amp; compliance, where jobs are much more than available experienced employees. My career really took off after a masters in a very reputable college and some relevant certifications. In the last 4 years I've worked for 3 companies. Every position better than the previous. My goal is to reach c-suite level in this industry, which will happen in 3-5 years given the niche of the field. 

With my goal in mind, I'd like your advice on how to get there quicker. 

My (first World) problem now is that recruiters are reaching out to me all the time. I have a new offer every month almost, and it's tempting because usually they are slightly or substantially better than what I have now.

So, if my goal is to be hired in a c-level position in an organisation in a few years, what's my best option? Staying with my current company, where I'm happy, but it's kinda small, and grow internally, or just jump a couple more times to bigger organisations and positions, but my CV will look very ""jumpy""?"

I have been at my current job, which is retail for one whole year and I am still underperforming. It takes me a longer time to grasp certain things on the job. I learn slower than my peers. I am studying business in college right now. I am scared because I don't how I will survive in this world. I perform way too slow compared to my other coworkers, which sucks.

1198,Should I quit or stick around at a pretty good company with an active alcoholic/addict manager who can't manage our team effectively?,careerguidance,"I'm trying to navigate a weird situation and need advice.

I was hired at my company (a Fortune 500) on the creative team three years ago. My boss, until about a year ago, was a wonderful manager and person. She believed in me, fostered my growth, I've been promoted twice in my time here, and my pay has increased 50% in that time. I don't work overtime and I work remotely. I've flourished, have received multiple awards during my time here, and I now run my own small team of writers. I like my coworkers and the work we get to do.

However, about a year ago, my boss started drinking DURING remote work hours. I recently had to cooperate with an HR investigation of her after someone reported her for being sloppy drunk and speaking publicly on behalf of the company at an event. I don't know the specifics, but she's on an EAP program for that now, but she's still drinking during off-hours. She often sounds hungover, sick, scattered, and disorganized daily. She's also smoking heavily (constantly coughing during calls) and might be using pills (she admitted once to taking a pain pill during work hours and that's why she sounded like she was speaking gibberish). I honestly don't know how or why she wasn't fired after so many people verified she's drunk on the clock.

On top of that, she won't prioritize the team or manage the workload. She says yes to every willy-nilly request from everyone in the company, stuff that isn't even marketing or advertising (company birthday cards, thank you notes, misc social media posts that comms should be doing themselves, little signs for the offices, etc), and our time is consumed doing this dumb stuff when we should be doing campaigns and brand work. She needs to say no to this work so we can focus on actual marketing and she won't.

We started losing internal client work to outside agencies in small chunks two years ago, and now most of the campaign work is out of house. My team and the design team do good work, but we can't keep up with the full-service agency our company uses that has 20+ people on our account. It doesn't help that we're on our boss's dumb people-pleasing errands most of the time. We could be running more campaigns, but we'd need to be focused on them and not shit like making a potluck sign.

I have a small kid, I am paid well, have a good work-life balance, etc, so I don't want to just throw this job away. But I don't see our teams winning back the actual creative campaign work that I want to do and I don't like working for a drunk.

1201,Does my work environment sound bad or are there a lot of companies like mine?,careerguidance,"I'm asking because I feel like I want to know if my company is truly bad or not. Here are some descriptions of what goes on where I work:

- The pay seems pretty decent in my opinion. When I joined the company I got about a $15,000 raise.

- Sometimes there's randomly work at 9:00 pm at night. I would say about once every two months.

- About half of the work seems outsourced to India. For example, there's 5 Developers for a mobile app and 4 out of the 5 are in India

- I feel like people are thrown into situations without changing experience. For example, a Developer basically cried because lots of people were asking him to complete a task with 0 real life Development experience. Also, the managers frequently say things like ""just dive into the project and start working"". So, I would say they try to get employees to do tasks with very little training.

- The average time someone stays at the company is about 5 years and the total employee population is down 2 percent since last year"

I feel completely stuck at this job and have felt that since working here ive had very little progress if any in my career life.

It's just so odd to me how someone can appear to get along well with basically everyone at the company they work for. Yet, the company doesn't give the employee a raise and then the employee leaves. It almost seems like the relationships didn't really mean that much in the end. I just find that shocking.

My best guess is I suppose maybe some of the relationships he had were kind of fake and the company just viewed him as cheap labor."
1217,Has this ever happened to anyone? What does this mean and what do I do?,careerguidance,"I am putting this on a throwaway just in case. 

I am really bothered by some feedback I just got from my boss and I have no idea what to do about it.

Backstory - I’ve been with a large company for 4 years in multiple departments. I love the company. I received an internal promotion about 1.5 years ago in the midst of work from home (we still are). It’s a small team of 4 people. Combined, they have over 150 years of experience at the company in the role. 

The work is variable and usually heavy at the end of the business quarter. There’s not really assigned tasks, the work is due at a certain due date and how you get there is up to the individual. I assumed when I took the job there would be some troubles with the tenure of the team members because that’s just how it goes. 

What happened - So it’s the busy time. As I stated, due dates and work is heavy at the end of the quarter. The job is rather unique and difficult, so training was intensive and this was the first quarter I was let to do all the work on my own.

I saw this as a great opportunity to prove to the team I have listened and learned carefully. I wanted to earn their respect and show proficiency.  So I have busted my hump the past 3 days often working late to complete 35% of my quarterly workload already.

All the work was verified as correct and not the least bit sloppy. I was very excited because I could feel my confidence growing. We had a team meeting today where we share what we’re working on. My boss even said, “WOW, awesome job getting that done ALREADY”. All other tenured members of the team hadn’t completed anything. 

All good, right? Well, no. My boss calls me this afternoon and I could tell there was an impending coaching. I’m sure you all know the feeling. The awkward small talk when they know you know this is something deeper.

She essentially tells me there is concern from the team that I’m working too fast and not asking enough questions. I’m floored. I don’t know what to say. I could hear in her voice that she didn’t want to be having this conversation and was almost embarrassed by it. I merely reply the work is correct and I don’t have any questions - I’ve been trained for a year and a half. 

She then responds, “well, even if you don’t have questions, maybe talk to the team and reiterate what you do know so they can build trust in you”.

Essentially I was coached for working swiftly, efficiently, and independently. I thought I was proving to the team my abilities and commitment to the role. Guess not.

What alternate career paths can I take?  I hear friends and family talk about making lots of money and only have to work 3 hours a week. How does that happen?

I’m a computer programmer located in Arkansas. I’ve 10 years of experience most of which has been for very small companies. Despite that, I don’t feel like I’m the best programmer in the world. I left my last job of 5 years under not the most favorable circumstances. Before that, I worked a year contract with a local small cap with the option to hire and they didn’t extend any offer to me. I heard from the 3rd party recruiter that they were kind of pissed about my performance. I’ve had my share of successes too, but the success tends to be overlooked if something goes wrong.

I took a job with the state thinking it would at least be a steady job, and it is. It’s also boring and I’m way under paid. I sit in my office for the required 8 hours and most days I don’t talk to any of my coworkers. No Bueno.

The daily grind of work sucks for me right now. I need higher pay, things are tight with the new baby and it should be something that I’d enjoy. Working with people that I like is one way, but there is no way to know if I’d make friends at the new place. Maybe a change career would help. Is there anything else I can do with my experience?

I have highly marketable skills which opens up a lot of opportunities. I could get a high paying remote job. But I’m worried that I won’t perform well enough to keep it. I could relocate to an area in state that has several large companies. They have good pay and I could potentially make friends. But, would have the same performance requirements as any remote job and I’d have to uproot my family. The jobs that are most local to me probably don’t pay as well as the other two options despite being in the capitol city; but it would be the easiest option.

Are corporate high paying jobs hard to hold down? My only experience with was with one that highered a whole bunch of new people and it seems only the top x% would be retained. How can I find a job that I’ll enjoy going to?

I have experience in b2b sales and forming lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with businesses and clients.

Real estate agent - I have a family member who has said they would sponsor my training materials if I pay for the testing, they also work with a company in Oregon and are involved in the recruiting for the company and have said they would set me up with a job and company training as soon as I start studying the materials. My concern is that I am not much of sales person and I don't wish to work long hours, but the support and confidence from my relative has given me some comfort encouragement.

Mortgage broker - It seems to be similar but requires slightly more hours of training, rather than selling myself to clients it seems I would be trying to form relationships with lending agencies and banks. the pay between these two is fairly comparable at the entry level, though I may have to put in more effort to start as a broker.

Enrolled Agent with the IRS - This one has the highest overhead it seems, with the slowest turn around before actually starting work, with some seasonal blackout dates for when the test is available. This one resonates with me the most personally but I am concerned with the uncertainty of the time frame and not being able to take a test for March or April.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I am slowly chiseling away at classes towards a degree but I am paying out of pocket and it is a slow road.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering an IT certification to accompany one for these paths but I wouldn't be able to being until April so would like to start something else now and then start the IT program after I am working.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or similar types of training and certification or licensing would be very much appreciated.

To those who read this far, I sincerely appreciate your time and energy in reviewing this post.

Kind Regards,

Apart from the fact that I am being ignored on my career progression requests, I enjoy my team and the perks of WFH/flexibility and the fact that they are based throughout Canada as I do plan on moving from Van to Calgary in a few years to save/buy a home. I know where my bread is buttered but I am in need of mental stimulation, not more mundane work.

The roles I am interested in are not client facing roles, I enjoy more background, self sufficient roles where I'm not constantly collaborating with others, I like to work alone for the most part so the roles that I am drawn to are:

-Analyst,Compliance &amp; Risk Mgt
-HR
-onboarding/training new staff
-IT

I think they would suit my INTJ analytical personality and I would thrive in them areas as I find them interesting. My only problem is I don't have any official education, just admin experience. In an ideal world I would love a mentor to guide me and learn that way but most roles like the above requires degrees,  CIA Designations , prerequisite which is very disheartening. 

There is prerequisite of a 3 year degree to do the CIA exam, can I not just study and take a pre test to see if I am capable? 



Any advice?"

If I ask too high, I look really bad. If I ask too low I am underpaid. I just want fairness. I was on a phone interview once when the guy interviewing me asked me for my pay requirements.

This is why I prefer jobs where the pay is outright stated."

But the work is significantly less as I audit most of the day. The work is not enjoyable even when I DO have a task. Biggest issue is my team lead is a nightmare. He’s sexist. He’s an air head who forgets things frequently, then blames others. He micro manages to where he asks me to actually forward all my emails to him….. He’s under qualified and desperately needs an ego check. I thought the switch would help but now I find myself really regretting my choice.

1241,Which option is best to help me set out a career in HR?,careerguidance,"Im stuck at the moment as I’m considering doing apprenticeships. 

I have interviews etc and am wondering what ‘path’ would be best. 

One apprenticeship is at a school and is a administrator/receptionist role. It’s way off HR but does include some jobs and skills that are transferable - qualification is business administrator level 3. 

Another is HR advisor apprentice but is HR helpdesk so apparently more on the IT side according to them. Qualification is again business administrator level 3. 

Last one is HR Support and the job is shadowing individuals in HR etc A lot more specific and the qualification is HR Support level 3. 

The problem is the first two could potentially start within the next month and the third at the end of the year/beginning of next and I can’t hold out that long. It’s hard enough trying to find work that’s not an apprenticeship as I’m seen as being under qualified for a lot of roles. Job market is hectic and I have bills to pay. 

I’ve been looking for other HR apprenticeships for months and there have been none. All are business admin level 3.

I understand how difficult/unlikely it is to get my foot in the door to HR with a Business administrator qualification but I’m wondering if anybody can help steer me in the right direction. 

More importantly - I’m interviewing for the first 2 and the third is highly competitive and I’m yet to hear back."

Lateral Move to New Company
Hey all,

I work for a major insurance carrier and will be receiving an offer today from another major carrier for essentially the same position.

I like the people at my current company, I am a high performer, and my manager is supportive. However, my multiple attempts to advance through applying internally for other positions for which I qualify have been met mostly with non-interview rejections. If I'm honest, it's demoralizing and a little hurtful given my reviews (highest rating you can get) and my tenure (5 years) with the company.

New company has poached a number of my coworkers already. They all report good things culturally and an improved work/life balance. I'd actually be working with a former coworker should I accept the new offer. I trust their judgment. New company is headquartered locally as well, while my current company's main campus is in another city. I figure upward mobility opportunities might be more plentiful the closer I am the HQ.

My current company is aware of their staffing losses to the new company and recently raised senior staff's pay to align with offers being made by new company. I figure I will go from $80k to $85k to move companies. Benefits similar, costs similar, pension and 401k match slightly better.

I am due for my next performance review in a few weeks and expect to be at $85k anyway. I don't think new company will do $90k.

Is it worth starting fresh at a new company for minimal pay increase for the potential for long term promotion gain? I'll have to rebuild my reputation, so I figure 1-2 ""wasted"" years if I take the new offer. I'll miss my company's annual bonus payout in April, but new company's bonus at Christmas and next March should make up for that.

Is it a good idea to move companies for a relatively flat pay change just for possible work/life balance and promotion opportunities?"

I wanted some advice about what career would be suited to me depending on my likes. I know i cant have everything perfect but please do give me some advice on what career you think will suit me

\- i really enjoy being involved in the world, as in lets say tomorrow there is a the  disbandment of NATO or maybe a war, I want it to affect my career and the decisions I make (which I think a career in business/finance would allow me to do)

\- I have a very large area of interest such as innovative technology and transport, sustainability, development and healthcare and essentially i want my career to give me aspects of them all (once again maybe something like business management will allow me to work on many different projects)

\- I want the chance to utilise my creative flair and problem solving ability to think about solutions to real-life problems and be able. I thought medicine would give me this but tbh its all just guidelines

\- I really enjoy being up to date with the news and enjoy reading about global relations and how it affects the world such as the current khazakhstan protest or the fall of Afghanistan and I want my career to allow me to be involved in these situations. 

So given al that, it appears to me that going down a business/finance path is probably the best thing, maybe something like management consultancy, or a business consultant. Please do let me know what you guys think and I apologise for the long post!!"

Seeking some advice.

I am a final year engineering student graduation this April. I have about 20 months of combined internship/co-op experience in both the private sector and the federal government while having 5 years of military service in the Canadian Armed Forces - Reserves. I have specialized in Project &amp; Engineering Management while gaining experience in Product Management, stakeholder relations, System Integration and some Software development.

Over the years, most of my family has left Canada and I am hoping to do the same as it is getting lonely being by myself, not to mention the fact that various US industries offer more diverse opportunities and higher pay. Therefore, I would like to request some advice from fellow Canadians in how you went about finding and pursuing engineering opportunities in the US.

I have been attempting to network with recruiters and professionals via the LinkedIn method with not much success unfortunately. I either receive no responses or the usual ""PLEASE ONLY APPLY IF YOU DO NOT NEED SPONSORSHIP TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE UNABLE TO CONSIDER CANDIDATES WHO REQUIRE SPONSORSHIP."" I always thought it was much easier going in-between Canada &amp; the US.

I am aware about the TN visa but it seems to not be an acceptable way for most employers and they won't consider you based on the possibility of a TN. Therefore I would highly value some career advice pertaining to finding relevant opportunities in the US from Canada.

Thank you in advance."

1259,unsure if the healthcare field is for me?,careerguidance," 

Recently I interviewed for healthcare positions such as ophthalmic technician, physical therapy aide, medical assistant, and today another medical assistant job. My experience with healthcare began last April in a fast-track nursing assistant program. My instructor was one of those instructors who micromanaged and made me feel worse when I made a mistake at the long-term care, it took me 3 times to pass the class for the skills portion and since I didn't learn things as fast as the other classmates, she almost dropped me during clinicals

I have experienced doubt usually after for all of these positions the aide, assistant, and the technician. when inteviewer took me on tour to meet many staff members it was kind uncomfortable (i didnt know how to act), and not really excited about the opportunities since I wouldn't know how the day-day would feel until I actually start working in the position. I like to help people I know that cause I recently helpd shovel other cars out of the snow next to mine, when I could of just did mine and I ran to help other people push someone elses car out of a snowbank

My current job is a teacher assistant for a headstart/childcare facility and I don't have those doubts being there 2 years (its more i get frustrated and take it personal when the kids become challenging a, I do however enjoy being center of attention during circle time (inattentiveness causes me to come up with creative ways to teach abcs or come up with transitions), but when its free-time its non-stimulating and not want to get down on floor to play with kids, when I began it just felt different and when i interviewed I saw things that excited such as watching the teachers lead the kids. I'm about to give up in terms of career fields, I considered electrician or data center installer, graphic designing (taking classes now), cook (low pay), x-ray tech, working at fredmeyers at cashier taught me I love to talk to people

I began suffering anxiety after being a health and safety professional 8 months which is what I went to school for first, i believe the cause was negative interactions between co-workers,lack of interest of the job, and that job was easy to leave since I experienced that and talked to my dad about how i felt every week, didnt look forward to going to work on monday, doing lots of data entry and any office oriented task especially if I was on night shift I would easily get carried away and get on my phone or google things for career searching."

1264,"Not really being taught anything anymore at new job, getting stressed/frustrated/upset. What do I do short of begging to be involved?",careerguidance,"'m about 4.5 months into a job. At first, I was basically sitting around all day reading stuff for a month because, you know, they were too busy and in such a crazy time (that's always the case, huh). One of my bosses would constantly come up to me and ask what I was working on. He'd chuckle when I'd say I'm reading more stuff. He's the kind of person whose guidance is just, ""Any questions, just ask."" x10000. I don't even know what I'm supposed to be asking about, though.

I have a coworker about twice my age who's one level above and who started two weeks before I did, who this week told me he felt bad for me at the time (we commiserated about the lack of training) and even gave the 'ask questions' guy a nudge about my having nothing to do. And he still didn't do anything. To this day, he hasn't taught me a thing.

They're always like, 'trial by fire!' but they don't even give me any trials.

I have a female coworker my age one level above who was VERY good about teaching me things (and propping and hyping me up to DEATH to the others) constantly after a certain point (on the days she actually bothered to come into the office for like 4 hours max), but one day I left too early for her liking and she yelled at me out nowhere and I cried and it's kind of weird now. She's taught me stuff since but not nearly as much. I also feel like she's messing with me. The other day I asked for something to do (a continuation of the process I was FINALLY being taught and doing a lot of work on), and she said she had tasks for me, but she LITERALLY gave it all to the coworker above me who's twice my age. I know it sounds corny but it was **devastating** to me. She knows how much I want to learn this and it was a slap in the face. She's spent the whole past week giving him the work and guidance I should have. I'm so upset. (He also has other projects to work on because he's above me so it's a double slap.) She literally just video chatted with him this morning and was talking about how great a job he was doing with it on our team's daily meeting. I'm WFH so I started crying lmao. I'm just...

She also suggested I do a stupid presentation for them like I'm in the 4th grade. That's literal busy work. It's so insulting.

There's literally one process I've owned and taken control of since I got here. Another guy a level above me is the one who does all the super low-level procedural stuff I should be doing (as I've been told by others many times), but you can't pry it from his cold, dead hands. So I'm left looking stupid.

Yesterday on the side my coworker told me to run with an email request, so I dropped in the group chat I was looking at it, and then the older coworker twice my age chimed in and basically answered the question. I felt so stupid. How am I ever going to be involved if I just get stomped on and shut out by people with more experience?

My coworkers say I'm so smart and all gave me great feedback, to the point where the BIG boss said he was even trying to promote me and gave me a glowing year-end review. That is so beyond laughable. I'm glad they like me, but that is just so unearned it's unreal.

I'm never gonna learn anything by just reading a bunch of laws and regulations. I'm not gonna learn what they do day in and day out. It helps, but it's not work. And I'm scared if I just sit back and do that (which I don't want to anyway), it's gonna look like I'm slacking.

I genuinely want to learn this stuff and was SO excited when I got to helm the beginning of the process these past few weeks. But suddenly they just stopped talking to me about it and the lead (female coworker my age) gave all the work to the other guy who already has shit to do (after she said she was giving it to me lol), and I'm just like??? Ok?? They talk about how they want me to learn but this isn't doing anything. For either of us, because the other guy is also confused and has no idea what happened at the beginning of the process. It makes no sense.

I can't BEG to be involved. If I do, they'll think I don't need guidance, and I do. This is serious shit I could mess up. I don't know what to do. I'm crumbling. I don't want to mess this up because I'm making almost six figures at a huge company. This can't be matched.

I don't know whom to talk to anymore. I'm scared of messing this opportunity up. It's extra hard right now, too, because everyone is all scattered because of Covid. I'm trying really hard not to shut down as I usually do when I'm upset. But it's hard and I don't want to come off as whiny or annoying. What do I do?"

The MD, my manager's superior, heard about my desire to transfer during my exit interview and offered to open doors and facilitate the transfer himself. 

There are several positive factors, he respected my resignation, allowed me to continue interviewing (to consider other offers), and said I would be welcomed back either way. If anything, the friendliness and lack of toxicity felt refreshing.

With regards to salary, the gross pay may be higher but the net would be lower as the location is a Tier 1 city, which is acceptable. What do you guys think?"

I’ve been at my current job for about half a year now. My job is weird, and there are no clearly defined expectations or job responsibilities, and there’s no formal training—a lot of it is using my own intuition, learning on the job, and asking questions, all of which I do. It’s easy to make mistakes in this job, many of which are things that I didn’t know I was, or were not supposed to do, and I do make those mistakes occasionally. Even though they are innocent mistakes that result from a lack of training/communication, I own up to it, and apologize for it. But my boss still gets mad at me, chews me out, and then we move on. Recently, I made the mistake of not doing something that I didn’t know I had to do because it was not defined and nobody told me. For whatever reason, this made my boss so angry that they chewed me out, said they’d talk to me when they’re ready to talk to me again, dismissed me for the day, and they are now downright refusing to speak to me. We’re having to correspond through a coworker. Have any of you ever experienced anything like this? What would you do if you were me? And I want to be clear, when I say I don’t know what to do sometimes I don’t mean because of that I sit around twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. I make an effort to do something, and sometimes it is not what was wanted. This recent incident was a case of me not knowing a certain protocol we follow....because it was not shared with me.

1272,How to stop second guessing my choice ?,careerguidance,"I finally took the decision of which job I wanted after being proposed 2 jobs. The decision was so hard that I’m mentally exhausted and although I feel relived I now started wondering if my decision is the right one. I’m tired of myself. Is second guessing normal ? Idk, I’m just hoping to hear something nice and reassuring."
1273,My job I love extended my contact twice. Now the position has been approved for permanent role. They are telling me I have to go through the interview process again. Should I reapply or just find somewhere else to work?,careerguidance,"Here is a little back story. I accepted contact role last year, with MD Anderson Cancer Center. It’s been a great experience. One of my dream places to work. (Personal reason). So the initial contact was only 5 months. After the contact was up, they extended it. Due to my performance and also the CFO of the hospital had not approved the the position to be permanent yet. So, luckily I got extended another 7 months. The seven months are coming to and end, so I was following up on the status. 

I got call today from my office manager, and was asked questions about pay at my last job etc etc. 

That the position will soon be approved and she wants to give me more than I was making at my last job. I was excited. 



She then said, the boss I work under the executive director, said that i have to go through the interview process again, that they have to formally post the job position add for other candidates to be able to apply. But in the meantime, they extend my contract 3 more months (May 2022) until they are done with the interview process. 

They both mentioned, that this is standard and obviously I have the upper hand on other  candidates as I been in the role already almost a year. 

Mind you i feel kind of bummed that i wasn’t just transitioned into the permanent role and slightly misled. I know it was contract but he kept reminding  me that he is working to make it permanent. As though I would just be transitioned over.  So should i apply to other jobs just in case? Or what? It’s a constant waiting game and it’s been nerve racking. 

I go to college full time, as well as work full time. Being that this job is remote has been a blessing. And the pay helps with my school fees. 

Sorry it was long, but what would you do?"

1281,What are good career options for people who have been in banking 5+ years?,careerguidance,"Hey everyone!

I’m 26 and I have been in banking for about 6 years now. Banking is something that I have been great at, but honestly I do not like it at all. When I very first started in banking, I truly did enjoy it. However, as time went on it became a job truly do not enjoy. I only work 25 hours at the bank currently to try to focus on my passions outside of banking.

I got into banking because I wanted to connect with other business owners and successful business people. This has been huge for me. Because of banking, I have started my own business (this is my true passion) and got into crypto/NFTs which I have done well on.

My business is my true passion. I started it about two years ago and had incredible success in growth, but nothing crazy in sales. My social media for my business surpassed 100k followers on each social media app. I make about $1k-$5k in sales each month.

With all this being said, I’m hoping to find a work from home part time position that would be a great transition from banking or that is within banking that I could look for.

Any suggestions are much appreciated!

Thank you."

1286,"Should I whistleblow anonymously (email goes to multiple global office admins) or speak to my department's global head directly, about toxic environment caused by my local line manager?",careerguidance," The new head of department in my country and his underling (our line manager) have created a toxic environment in the past two months since they joined where they are rude and have done underhanded things to show increased team utilization to the global head office (during their probation). They have made the workload unbearable, are becoming personal, unprofessional and fired people under questionable circumstances and are not open to listening. The picture that has been painted to the global office is that our team is the issue, not them.

Local HR is always taking side of the management, and they are all friends outside of work. I would want to raise this issue so it gets highlighted because global wouldn't know about the work enivronment and the stats meddling,

Should I:

1. Raise it via the whistleblowing email address provided by global for operational concerns present in local countries?
2. Email my global boss directly and inform them directly of what is transpiring, to be direct and keep a hope alive of being given the job myself (i was previously considered for it but local HR wanted to bring their own friend)

1296,What path would you choose?,careerguidance,"I was brought into a department as a manager by a c-level executive that has since left the company. I was an internal hire, I had all the qualifications for the role with the added benefit of not needing to be trained but there was still a little bit of resistance to get me approved. My company doesn’t have many women let alone any people of color at the management level and I’m not sure if that played a part but it was definitely an observation I easily made. 

My manager left after 2 months of me on the job (she didn’t like their business practices and professional relationships had gone awry because of lack of trust and transparency - mostly on the business side.)

For the last 4 months (6months on the job now) I have been working my butt off, not only handling my responsibilities but assuming hers as well. I have been the only one in the department and so I was was the only thing keeping the department running. My department needs at least 3-4 people so it’s been a lot of work and I’ve been hearing nothing but praises. 

I helped hire the new manager who I like and since then I’ve started to hear things from my current interim-manager like “you’re a junior so you have a lot to learn from him it will be great”, “how old are you”(to communicate how young I am but mind you there are men with less experience that are my age or younger in more senior positions at this company), “we will make sure to get another hire that you can report to” which has sounded like I won’t be reporting to him and they are planning to essentially functionally demote me. I have been improving processes and leading meetings and acting as head of this department for the last few months since I was on my own so I really expected to be the next managers number 2 and help them build the department. Especially since I’ve been going above and beyond with multiple leaders recognizing my work and process improvement initiatives. However it doesn’t sound like my expectations align with what they are saying.

My previous manager who had hired me said she is now looking for her number two and wants to bring me on at her new company. I would help her build the department which is exactly what I want. I think this is my better option but not 100%. 

Here’s a summary of the options, what would you choose and why?

Option 1- stay at current job. 
Pro: The new manager is really great and knowledgeable - I want to learn from him. I already get paid pretty well. Lots of room for growth since the company is growing so fast.
Cons: business has some unethical practices that make me pretty uncomfortable. There is a chance I could be functionally demoted.

Option 2- move to new company with previous manager
Pro: I have a good relationship with manager, change for salary bump (20-40%). I would definitely be their number 2.
Cons: manager is more type b personality wise whereas I am type a (prob something I need to figure out how to navigate. New company - grass may not be greener but manager said I would really like it.

For example, it might take me 5 apps in higher ed to get an interview or 2, but about 100 apps to even get a call/email back for any other field. I've been working in student services (finaid) for almost 2 years now and I'm in the process of getting my MA in Counseling, so my marketability in higher ed is growing, but I'm not sure about other fields. 

My MA in Counseling will help me get my foot in the door as both licensed therapist and college admin. I wouldn't mind being a part time private practitioner with a part time role on a campus or some other variation, but I worry that if I want to make a career change in the future that it will be harder for me, having established myself more in higher ed admin.

This is actually influenced with one of my family members who used to criticize every little mistake that I did (e.g. : putting the bag 2 meters from the supposed place). this cause me also fear to make big decision and lead people.

1308,Should I leave my Job?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Forgive the long post:

So I decided to take on a bold new journey during the pandemic. After 4 years in a very comfortable IT role I transitioned into a new business role (still in IT) at a company where I new some folks. The project kicked off and was really struggling with people leaving left and right. It crushed morale and scapegoating became a huge problem. 

It started out as a contract so I was open to other jobs as a backup really from the beginning and decided to continue interviewing even after being hired full time. 

I went through more interviews than I can count with companies that reached out through LinkedIn, received a few offers but most of the roles were contract to hire or gave me a bad vibe.

I finally landed on the same job title with a company stressing a good work life balance, training opportunities and excellent company culture (albeit a startup company). I left that previous role at the year mark and have been here about 7 months and I’m already looking again. 

Turns out the company is a consulting company (not a deal breaker but not something they were clear about) and not only is the work life balance bad (50-60 hour weeks minimum) but I was also told I’d be working on projects related to healthcare (my domain) yet I’ve already been staffed with a bank through the end of this year. To boot, both the previous PM and BA left simultaneously so I was thrown in about 3 months ago and have been pretty much drowning ever since as the client was already pissed about the failing project and missed timelines of my predecessors. My PM is also new and is constantly kicking down due to being stressed herself and naturally, the project is understaffed and will almost certainly remain that way. This is honestly the tip of the iceberg but I don't have the option to get off the project because 4 other BAs have left during the 3 months I had been here.

I know the advice is to always aim for a year before leaving, but I feel catfished. I'm not completely naive, I know companies mislead but this combination of factors seems like grounds. I was very clear in my interview what I was looking for and what would get me to leave my last company. I don’t want to waste time working on a project unrelated to my career industry and interests. Plus, i’m working absurd hours and I’m stressed to the point of it affecting my health with no end in sight. I’ve come close to quitting a few times without another gig after some of the days I’ve had here.

1317,Should I leave?,careerguidance,"I am 33F, have worked at the company for the same boss for 12 years. I recently was promoted to AVP of our department. However, my boss’ lack of management, motivation, and productivity has made it feel like I am the AVP of nothing. There is no control over the staff because of unfair work expectations. There are no set hours because he refuses to hold anyone accountable to them because he himself cannot be held accountable. He arrives to work at least two hours late a day, socialized, has lunch, leaves to do personal business, comes back, leaves early. He is very dismissive of anyone’s opinions, makes everyone second guess themselves, and has allowed bullying behavior from one of our colleagues.

In particular with me: 

He is so jealous of the new president’s confidence in me (I do a lot of writing for the president) that he gets angry and has on multiple occasions now, thrown things around the office. Most recently he threw scissors across the wall and they broke. 

He asks me to do his job. For example, he needed to prepare for a meeting by reading a document but he didn’t want to so he had me read it, type up notes, and he went into the meeting with my notes. He does this all of the time. 

He didn’t tell anyone about my promotion for two months. By then it had hit the rumor mill and people resented me for not being forthcoming about it. 

I have developed a fear in the last few years of public speaking. I never had this before. I used to love speaking publicly. Now I shake and get tongue tied. I realized yesterday that his nitpicking and comparing has made me insecure in all aspects. I realized this when we were interviewing someone for a vacant position. I gave my opinion afterwards and he dismissed it. He quickly started comparing her in a positive way to another professional woman at our job but not to me, as if to say she was a good candidate because she was like the other woman, when he could have just used me as an example. He then quickly turned to comparing my worth to my looks: If a male employee seems to like my work (the president, another VP, etc) he tells me it’s because they’re attracted to me. It’s never because I have a good work ethic or I’m smart. And I don’t really think much of myself but I will say I work hard and I am smart. But he makes me feel so small. I don’t feel that way when I’m around the president or others in the company. I feel confident in my opinions and decisions when I’m away from my boss. I am hopeful that the president will ask me to work for him. He has alluded to it in the past few months, but I can’t wait around not knowing for very long. 

So, do I leave? I have another job offer with someone I used to work part time for. Same money. I have some reservations about that job. Or, am I overreacting? Is this type of work environment normal? It really is the only place I have worked. 

I appreciate any guidance."

I like my job and I’m very comfortable here but I’m trying to push myself out of the restaurant industry and into tech by going to college for CS, tech which is one of my passions.

It’s the off-season of my restaurant job now so I’m thinking fine now and really motivated to switch industries but I’m afraid once I start working again I’ll start getting too comfortable and make no progress and stay stuck. I’m just trying to get out of restaurants while I’m young as they have a reputation for low pay, long hours, and poor conditions like no breaks. Lots of people who have been in restaurants their whole life told me they regret it and wish they got out while they were young and single like me. 

The same problem happened to me last year actually. I planned on enrolling in college last year during my offseason but I ended up getting a promotion at work and pushed everything aside because I was too comfortable there.

Can anyone give me some good motivation to keep going on with my goal of starting school for CS, which I know will be better for me in the long run? I’d really appreciate it."

1321,Is this fair? Need your input.,careerguidance,"I work for a company as an employee (not contractor) on short term contracts (8 weeks). 

How that works is I'm hired to do a job for another company who my employer has a contract with. 

So let's call my employer **John**, and the other company **Doe**.

John has a contract with Doe. Doe pays John $X/hour for me. John takes out %50 (actual percentage) from that rate and gives me the rest. 

I never deal with John, they just deposit my checks. They are in a different state and I have never seen/met anyone from John. %99.9 of my dealings are with Doe. So for all intenents and purposes, Doe is my employer. I report to my boss from Doe and they are the ones who oversee eveything I do. 

The only time I've communicated with John was at the beginning of my contract many moons ago, and more recently (see below). The renewals are automatically sent towards the end of the 8 weeks and I just sign them. 

I don't get time offs, vacations, sick leaves, insurance (my choice)...etc. John pays nothing in expenditure except my paycheck, taxes, overheads and whatnot. So no expenses such as supplies that John has to handle...that's covered by Doe. 

**Now...**

I've been working with Doe for a very long time, renewing my 8 week contracts all the time. 

My last renewal, I expressed my wishes to Doe for this to be my last contract. Doe tried to convince me to stay, so at the end I asked John for a raise. John contacted Doe for an increase and Doe forwards me their communication of their own accord. John doesnt know this.

Doe later agrees to the increase. John never tells me of this. I hear it from Doe. They say ""We reached an agreement with John for $X/hour. We are looking forward to continue having you with us""...among a ton of follow ups with me. 

This new amount is EXTREMELY generous. It's what I'd thrown out there for Doe when they were convincing me to stay and it was only meant to be as a way for me to get out because they wouldn't let up and I was feeling guilty because I really like them. I didn't expect them to agree to it.

Doe doesn't know how much John is paying me but they assume it's around %85-90 of what they are paying them, when in actuality it's %50.

**Anyway...**

I contact John and ask them to send me the new contract (new start day as I wanted to take a week time off - unpaid of course)...and John sends me the new contract... at the same rate as before.

The new rate Doe is paying John is almost twice the old one, and from that %100 raise, John was offering me the same as before, essentially giving me none of the increase. I suppose they think I don't know of the increase and was just hoping I renew my contract after my short break - thinking the request for the new contract was just the date change, and change of mind and that I decided to continue with Doe.

I tell John that it should be a new higher rate.

Later John gets back to me with a new contract at now %44 percent of the rate to me. So John now takes %56 of the new rate (from %50 with the old one).

So for example if the old rate is 100, they were offering me 50 (%50).

Now the new rate is 200, and they are offering me 88 (%44).

Is this fair?

I feel Doe's share should be the same ""in amount"" as it was before - 50. 

With this new rate, it would bring the percentage down to %25 (but it'd be the same *monies* as before). 

Or max no more than %5 more than the amount they were taking before; 52.5, which would mean %30 for John. 

The raise was something I myself initiated, *for me*, with Doe and Doe agreed to in order to keep me.

I'm currently working at a fintech startup located in London (UK), and have been working for the last three months. I'm in the middle of my probation period.

I have recently had a one to one session with my manager, CEO and founder of this startup, and he has stated that they are quite happy with my overall performance and skills. My colleagues are happy with me and they perceive me as a good colleague, helpful and hard-working.  However, he said that I was not in the right path to pass my probation, as he didn't perceive me as ""passionate"" about the company, and that he wanted to have ""first-team players"" in his team, something he thinks I am not. 

My question is the following: how can I show that I have a genuine interest in the company and its growth? It is true that from the beginning my onboarding has been a little bit informal (something I said to my manager in that session I referred to above) and that my role specifications have not been clearly stated from the beginning (something I have also told him). After saying that, he agreed to set up a plan for me, so that I can have a more structured job role, in order to help boost my happiness and perform even better as a ""first-team player"". 

What else could I do to reflect my genuine interest in the role and company? What does my amanger actually mean after that feedback? This is my first time working at a startup, not the first time in the field, and I don't really understand the logic behind being told that I work great, but my mentality is wrong. I don't have anybody outside the company that has experience in startups to ask this, and I think there may be someone with more experience in this subreddit who could give me good feedback and advice on this.

Thanks for your attention, and sorry for the lengthy post!

Please keep safe!"

Any recommendations welcome!

About me:

* I'm 27
* CPA
* Live in San Diego CA
* Make almost six figures working for myself part-time
* I love working for myself. Hate being an employee.

Some criteria for my new career:

* I want to stay in Southern California, so the occupation must be in-demand around here (or if it's online then it doesn't matter). I like being a CPA because of the shortage of accountants; i can find a job any time and anywhere and it'll pay high. (problem with this job is that it's not interesting per se).  I need way more adrenaline in my life and definitely more human interaction.
* Intellectually stimulating, more interesting, and involving problem-solving,
* I wouldn't want to go back to school for too long to become it - maybe a year max.
* Self-employment possibility is a must,
* Some travel is desired,
* Something highly-respected, like CPA

What can you come up with that's in high-shortage and is fun or intellectually stimulating?

One idea that I had was to become a self-employed Private Investigator - what is this career like nowadays? Is it bullshit? Is there high demand?

Can I become an architect or a real-estate developer without going to school for it?

Any advice appreciated, thank you!!"
1335,Fresh Grad - Offer in a new industry or offer in new office in current industry?,careerguidance," 

Hey all

I hope this post finds all of you well &amp; happy 2022 so far!

I'm a mechanical engineering senior in college &amp; I'll be graduating this May. I've already accepted an offer as a Software Engineer (signed contract) at an American bank but an ex-professor (whom I'm close with) just reached out to me to share about an offer with a national research institute that he recently joined last June as deputy manager. He's building up the team at this research institute as he's spearheading an initiative to drive up the innovation &amp; technology there. He brought me down to their office &amp; shared about the current initiatives there &amp; how data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, UI/UX are pillars that can &amp; will be included in their future work.

He mentions how he's sharing this opportunity with me as he cares for me &amp; that an environment like this is important for fresh graduates as we can explore &amp; try out roles in these different areas (data analytics, AI, ML, UI/UX) before deciding which to delve further into &amp; specialize in.

He made the point of how important domain knowledge is &amp; that the Mechanical Engineering major helps cement that &amp; skills such as data analytics, AI, ML are learnable &amp; ""add-on's"" that can be acquired on the job.

He also shared that the research institute will be able to pay for any extra courses (coursera, udemy, etc.) that I wish to attend &amp; are even willing to sponsor &amp; support further studies (Master's, PhD)

He also kept stressing that he &amp; his team are open to suggestions &amp; they will make it a very open &amp; safe environment. If I do join them, I don't plan on staying for long as the eventual goal is to delve deeper into software engineering, but if they have roles in that field then I might perhaps continue staying on. My professor mentioned the idea of ""you scratch my back, I scratch yours"" &amp; how he expects me to stay with the research institute for a couple of years. He also said they do have a bonus compensation scheme but it's only awarded to the top few performers

&amp;#x200B;

My Background:

* In my freshman year (around 2018-2019), I was frustrated that exciting entrepreneurship programs at college did not have internship positions suited to the mechanical engineering field &amp; trends in the world as a whole did not align with skills a mechanical engineering student might have: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, etc were booming at that time &amp; it was difficult for someone with just knowledge from my major to fit in.  
Mechanical engineering seniors from past runs of the programs were always interning in Business Development roles.
* That was when I decided I had to pick up skills in another discipline &amp; took a Minor in Computer Science. I've always liked building &amp; tinkering with things (LEGO my entire childhood) &amp; hence why I took up a Mechanical Engineering major. But my exposure to Computer Science in college opened up a new door for me as I was completely fascinated by how products can also be built digitally!
* But with COVID, robotics &amp; smart manufacturing has gained traction &amp; are probably gonna be important industries in the years to come
* Nearing the end of my 4 years, I've done 2 internships, 1 in data analytics, another in software engineering &amp; several school projects in AI, ML &amp; software engineering.
* I was extremely lucky &amp; fortunate to have scored the full-time role at the bank as I was the only applicant with a non computer science/data analytics degree

My Mindset/Headspace:

* Personally, I really enjoy building physical &amp; digital products but am now increasingly inclined towards software engineering as startups, NFT's, crypto &amp; web design are all things that I find really cool &amp; inspiring &amp; want to be a part of
* I've never been very interested in the classical aspects of mechanical engineering, such as manufacturing &amp; fluid mechanics, just the more advanced aspects such as robotics. I am pretty much done with mechanical engineering but want to move into areas such as data analytics, AI/ML, UI/UX &amp; software engineering
* Actually before he contacted me, I've pretty much made up my mind with the move to Software Engineering. He says it's a ""waste"" that the 4 years of mechanical engineering education is gone to waste but I personally don't mind at all as I know the opportunity cost later on in life (if I decide to stay in mechanical engineering &amp; switch to software engineering) will be much more expensive &amp; heavier
* I have some experience in Web Development from personal projects as I had stretched myself thin between the different areas (software engineering, data analytic, ui/ux, web development &amp; software engineering) to get a feel &amp; gauge for where my interest lies &amp; I feel that Web Development &amp; Software Engineering is the area I want to work towards.  
Even though these are relatively new fields as compared to Mechanical Engineering, I don't mind making the effort to learn them on the job.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dilemma:

* As my professor is working at a government research institute, he says that they (the research institute) can't afford to pay as much as what the American bank is offering me
* The environment in the research institute seems to still be new &amp; uncertain as my professor is still setting up the initiatives. I'm not sure whether the new initiatives involving UI/UX, data analytics, machine learning will be immediately available or I'll have to expense some time first working in a mechanical engineering role.  
This is where I feel my time could be wasted with ""bureaucracy"" &amp; ""hierarchical"" processes but my professor kept stressing that they're very open &amp; easy-going.
* My family had been struggling financially so compensation is personally a huge factor that I'm looking at as I also seek to be FIRE (Financially independent &amp; retire early)
* Apart from this research institute, opportunities in robotics in my country aren't as abundant as software engineering, but it's probably a chance to get a headstart in a field that might likely keep growing in the near future
* I know my career doesnt have to be either mechanical engineering or software engineering only &amp; the research institute could serve as a nice hybrid between the 2, but as I am set on switching to software engineering, I should &amp; want to take the software engineering role at the bank
* **Important Note**:  
I want to switch to software engineering but my job applications haven't been great so far. From a local forum, a senior from the bank's software engineering program mentioned that the environment isn't great for career development but this has been a mix as different people have had different experiences  
I was planning on using this software engineering role as a stepping stone to springboard to software engineering roles in other companies.  
The bank also offers relocation opportunities which is a huge plus for me (see 2nd career goal)
* The research institute's compensation scheme for top performers seems like a red flag &amp; i've personally had enough of the school environment where I always need to compete for that A grade.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Comparison:

* If I go with the research institute, I might have an opportunity to dabble in different areas &amp; gain exposure. As robotics &amp; smart manufacturing are gonna be big in the next few years, I have a chance to be a pioneer.
* If I go with the software engineering role at the bank, I have the chanc
* &amp;#x200B;
* e to relocate &amp; move to the states &amp; venture further into other software engineering roles.

My Career Goals:

* A move to USA/Canada
* Work in future/advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web Development, UI/UX or Robotics
* I want to work in a role that has high compensation

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, my professor has submitted my CV to the HR to expedite the application process &amp; I should expect to attend an interview with the group manager (my professor's boss) to speak with him &amp; find out more about the role

I don't plan on accepting the offer with the research institute but I will keep an open mind &amp; attend the interview to hear what they have to offer.

I am pretty set on the software engineering role at the bank but would love to hear what opinions or differing thoughts you guys might have. I am very open &amp; welcome any ideas if there are perhaps things I've overlooked."

1338,What jobs/ careers can a Restaurant Owner/ Operator move into??,careerguidance,"TL:DR
Restaurant owner and manager is burnt out and considering new options. What are good potential careers that earn $200k+ a year for someone with a lot of small business knowledge? BS in small business, econ, and marketing with minors in HR and accounting.

I'm a restaurant owner and operator, effectively GMing 2 restaurants I hold share in. The pandemic was rough on us, but being a quick service drive through concept we have stayed consistently busy. I am getting completely burnt out after 2 years of constant call offs and the craziest turnover anyone has ever seen. My sales have never been higher, and my staffing challenges have never been worse. 

Because every gap on the schedule falls on my plate and I want to keep my team happy and engaged, I'm working around 100 hours a week. It's not outside of my threshold, as it is kind of required when you open a new restaurant, which I've done successfully several times (my 2 stores and several others to help new franchisees). It's starting to become too much while trying to maintain a life and hopefully not fail another SO relationship. 

I've been in restaurants my whole life, about 17 years. Managing ops since 18. I've never had so many problems or felt like throwing in the towel. Until recently, I could manage an operation with minimal intervention, and mostly work 35-50 hours a week in a training role for my management staff after gaining footing and settling staffing. 

I'm very much considering selling at this point and moving into something new. I've tried everything I can think of. I am paying my management staff above and beyond market wages, but they still can't produce results without me. I can't really believe it's a lack of training on my part, as I have always been excessively thorough and available for every aspect of my restaurants, and never had any issues until this current situation. Turnover is killing us, even though are wages are $15 at minimum for a HS kid with no experience,  shift managers are making 40k+, and assistants are around 60k. I've hired and turned GMs but nothing seems to work with out me being very involved. 

Bottom line, I am considering moving and wonder what jobs I may be able to move into that provide better work/life balance and near the same income, possibly with opportunity to advance. I am well versed in all things business and have enough common sense and intelligence to figure out just about anything that's not to specialized. I have a triple BS in small business, economics, and marketing with minors in accounting and HR. 

The biggest problem I see when scrolling job boards is income potential. I currently earn around $275k/ year. I would be satisfied with $200k as long as there were advancement opportunities or the potential to earn more. 

What industry could I look at that may be a good fit? What specific jobs could I move into that would make sense with my degrees and particular business accumen on starting and operating units? Or managing large numbers of people?

Any advice is appreciated!"

1340,How to deal with a mean coworker?,careerguidance,"Hey guys

I'm relatively new to my job but it's within my industry so I haven't come in completely new.

There's an older lady at my work that has been there about a year.

Our boss gave us a last minute project two days ago.

Noting we are working from home due to covid.

It started when she created a spreadsheet and I made a copy of it as the spreadsheet was only allowing one person a time. To start my portion of the project, I made my own copy and I encouraged the other team members to do the same so we can get started and we don't have to wait for people to be done with it.

She told me not to do that, as it will confuse her and to use hers because I am creating more work for her. I replied saying I will copy and paste my work when I'm done - she didn't need to worry.

As the day goes by, some of the team members are either away/behind. I offered to do some of the work. I sent her a message saying to please let me help and she replied saying it's not hard to see where she was up to, to basically exercise some common sense and start from the bottom of the list.

I wasn't asking her where she was up to, I was handing her my support.

Honestly I feel hurt by this interaction, and being new, I don't feel like I can go to her for help now.

She also openly bitches about another team member to our boss, and as a result, that boss doesn't see her as very competent.

Should I go straight to my boss and let them know of my discomfort? Or should I stand up for myself next time she's rude?

I didn't say anything to her as I was in shock. I didn't reply for about 20 mins and then she sent me another message on the project.

I carried on to just get the work done.

Any advice you can offer would be great. I don't know how to handle rude people and I am still considered new and in training, that I don't feel confident to talk about it.

Thanks heaps"

I am making twice what i made 4 years ago in customer service. However, I am incredibly unhappy. I am currently a ""Planning Analyst"" for a shipping yard, Mainly what i do is request labor and maintain spreadshets. I had no prior experience in this field (logistics) prior to getting the position. Because of this, i feel like a bad fit. Additionally, I am more or less on call 7 days a week, am the only person in my role/department and have limited back up for my duties. I have had to work on scheduled vacation days (while not being able to reclaim that time) because of this. 

Prior to getting this position, I bounced around low paying customer service jobs and the change in compensation has definitely improved my life. It has also made this position feel like golden handcuffs. I have a BA in English (I thought i would be the next Mitch Hurwitz, but that dream is seeming less and less likely) After years of scrapping by, i would like to stay in a similar pay range but i do not know where to start looking. It feels like i lucked into this position. I am good with Excel, but don't know how to sell myself, or even what other jobs to look for because most postings for ""Planning analyst"" seem to be more in the financial sector, something i am probably even less qualified for.

1345,I need a new career but not sure what?,careerguidance,"Sorry it’s long! 

I started working at age 14 as a part time laborer for a landscaping company. Along with being a laborer I was working as a part time janitor and going to college full time. I wasn’t making enough $ to continue this lifestyle. So I quit going to college and had to quit my 2 part time jobs and get a full time job instead. 

Started working as a quality control inspector at a local aerospace manufacturing company, absolutely loved it! Did that for 2.5 years until I got BURNT out. I was only making $10/hr but my schedule was more stable. 

Left that job to be a Data Management Specialist at a large insurance company. I didn’t enjoy it but the pay was better  (was making $15/hr). I have anxiety and depression and was going thru some bad mental health issues so making lots of phone calls and training personal was a little much for me. 
I worked there for a little over 3 years and hated it everyday. Literally only did it cause the benefits were good and the pay. 
It was the most boring job ever. 

I left that job for what I was told was a “better” job. Although it was lower paying but had lots of opportunities to overtime. So I relocated back to my home town to work at the aerospace manufacturing company again. 

Started making $14.50/hr as a quality control inspector, same job as before but with a little different management. 

Did that for 2 years until I transferred to another department to be a CNC mill machinist (making $17.25/hr). I’ve done this for 1 yr 3 months so far and recently over the past 3 months been having a lot of depression/emptiness, not excited for work and everyday feels like a crappy Monday. I feel burnt out, fed up with the unfair management, low pay (I have over 5yrs experience and get paid the same or less than new hires) and feeling of working in pure chaos everyday (the company is rated really low). 

Basically I’m thinking of starting a new career that doesn’t involve this aerospace company. 

Something that is fresh and new. Not sure what? I don’t have a college degree but I’m totally willing to go to school to get one. 

I’m interested in helping others succeed, I have great training skills, great work ethic and financially capable to work either full or part time. Unfortunately I’m not very good at math (we use calculators in the machining area) and I’d prefer to not work in the food service areas.

I'm a 29 year old civil engineer in Mexico city Focused in project management with a master degree in construction company administration. I've only worked in this company for 9 years (my only reference) so these are my choices:

Decide A: stay in my current job with stability, I'm promised to become manager (my uncle is vice president) of one of the branch of the company. Currently working on one of the tallest building in town with very important contractors. The problem is that I've felt stuck in the last 3 years as a document controller. The current manager hates me. I believe that is because he doesn't want me there because I've an advantage with his son which is also a civil engineer. 
Also my income is shit (something like $1,350 usd per month and I believe it can be increased something like 8% in the short term). 
I work with 38+ year old guys with tons of experience so I consider this a great disadvantage for improvement. Also the environment is very toxic.

Decide B: work as a project manager for a smaller developer. I'm gonna be totally In charge of a 200 residences project with better benefits like health insurance, better pay (I'm negotiating $2,100 a month) , additional vacations, gas, bonuses. The problem with this one is that I believe is a relative new company, smaller projects and less stability. The truth is that I'm scared to be in front of a project, I've never been there and the fear of missing out the opportunity to become a manager with my uncle. I'm still in the interviews process but I can see they're very interested. 

So I would be very thankful to hear your opinions. Should I take the risk from B? Or stay with the stability of A.

Do I wait it out until I get a new job (hopefully) soon or should I bring it up to a manager?",careerguidance,"The co-worker I'm constantly with for the full 40 hours/week has never been the best person to work with all around. He was pretty much a desperate hire by management to fill a seat when the Great Resignation took off. He lacks the basic skill set to get the job done well and without issue, but on top of that, his attitude has been terrible all around. Since day one, this person has overstepped boundaries, complained about everything with the company, and picks at any small detail to gossip about or to create drama. It has drained me so much to the point where talking to this co-worker about anything even work-related makes me hesitant. 

This co-worker has also given upper management attitude before due to some conspiracy he made up in his head that we are getting fired and the company will replace us with some outsourced service. It has gone to the point where he got a warning due to his behavior. Many months have passed since then and this co-worker has cooled down since, but still looks to complain whenever. I do my best to ignore him and focus on what I need to do to keep my performance and department going.

I was recently on COVID leave and when I came back, this co-worker just had a bad attitude. He wouldn't turn away from his computer to say hello or anything. A couple of hours later, he complained to me about something random I was doing, but I just dismissed him because it was unnecessary and there really was no problem. I was doing my work as usual. He didn't like that and he went silent again. I noticed that he blocked me on Instagram that day (which isn't something I'm complaining about). However, I also noticed he's still keeping tabs on me from a secondary account. I usually ignore this, but I can't shake the creepiness. This co-worker and I have gone a week without saying a word. I don't really need to communicate anything work-related to him at the moment. It feels uncomfortable being in the office with someone acting hostile yet looking at what I'm doing outside of work.  We were recently pulled into a small conversation with a manager and he was acting the same way- monotone voice and never looked away from his computer, so maybe it isn't personal, but still odd. 

Should I continue to ignore it or bring it up to a manager? I'm thinking something happened when I was on leave perhaps, but my second guess is because I never answered his text to me when I was out of the office. I plan on completely blocking this co-worker on every platform if I get good news of a new opportunity soon. He's the main reason I started my job search these last few months anyway."

Being a small company, the benefits kinda suck and there is a simple IRA plan which there is talk of going to a much better 401K. HSA for health, and also vision, but no dental insurance. And the pay isn’t the best.
In 2020 I received a $1 raise, and in 2021, I actually had a job come up that was not quite, but close to double in pay. I spoke with the owner about it and expressed my split feelings on it and he gave me some old guy wisdom and shared more future growth plans for the company, and it’s looking extremely bright. 
I ended up turning down that job for more reasons about the role, but the current company did realize how far my pay was from the market standard, and that week I received an 8% raise, followed by a 10% raise and a 7% bonus at the end of the year.
The people are friendly, it’s close to home, but the last complaint I have about my role is that it’s a lot of the same stuff. There’s potential to change things up, which I’m working on. But the job has become not as challenging as I’d like since now it’s more about product deployment efficiency and volume rather than development (which is the part that I love.)

So what’s the opinion? Stay with a good job that has potential for growth or hop to better paying roles?

Plus, the stress, and physical activity is starting to take a toll on my body. I have high blood pressure and a small hunch from lifting boxes. I am in school for business administration in hopes of getting a stable office job with actual benefits and PTO. And I've been putting my resume out there, trying to apply to 10 jobs a week, message recruiters on LinkedIn and stalking career sites. I've got 3 interviews in the past 3 months (1 wanted to pay me half of what I make now and I couldn't afford it, 1 ghosted me after the interview and 1 said they found someone who is a better fit) I even took an excel class because I wanted to have that skill.

For those interested I provide authors I know, but no where near mastered, below.  It's pretty good stuff.

I've always dreamed of learning shotokan, wing chun, bagua Zhang, and xingyi...


I used to have a friend whose uncle did tcm.  I always thought that was cool.

I'm just fantasizing and need input.

I will still apply to Caribbean studies anthropology, and there I wanted to study Caribbean spirituality and folklore


Upon taking stock of what I believe now, tcm appeals to me because:


The demand and lucrative nature, unlike anything I can imagine in Caribbean studies.

One day I could afford to spend time in Trinidad anyway, maybe even practice tcm there.

I think herbs and foods as medicine is fascinating

It's probably less demanding for my personality

1366,Started a new job with 9-6 hours. Is it normal to be working past 6PM everyday?,careerguidance,"I (27M) started a new job about a month ago. It wasn’t until I started that I was told the hours were 9-6 (I should’ve asked during the interviews). Since then, I’ve always worked past 6PM, with the latest being 7PM. First off, I think 9-6 is just corporate slavery with the excuse that an hour lunch (unpaid) is included. Secondly, the reason I’m working late is because of:

1. Managers lack of ….managing skills. He pushes touch base meetings where my coworker and I scheduled time to explain deliverables. He then gets impatient and goes into these files without context, makes changes, then tells us he needs more work done. Work we already had done and changes that were already made but “fixed” because he didn’t let us walk him through it. 

2. We’re in the finance department. Yet I’m the only one who’s good at Excel. Everyone is awful. Literally uses their mouse to click Copy and click Paste. 

3. As a result of #2, a lot of files are manual and not automated. And everyone’s gotten so used to it, it’s become the norm. To literally copy and paste information when formulas can be used. I’ve tried to automate it but have been told to leave it since “we’ll have to update it again”

At my prior job and first job out of college, we were out by 5PM. Everyone valued each other’s life out of work. 

I went on a tangent but basically, my question was supposed to be: have I just been spoiled and is a 9-6 with unpaid overtime normal?

Edit: I would leave but I received a sign on bonus in addition to a considerable salary increase. If I leave before a year, I’d have to repay the bonus."
1367,Tesla vs Rivian?,careerguidance,"Which would be the better option for a career? I currently have offers for a design engineering position at both. I am really unsure of which to accept though. The Rivian offer is for somewhat more money, but is in very expensive Palo Alto, while the Tesla position is in Reno which is lower cost of living, so basically both positions are equivalent in pay when you do the math for cost of living.

I always thought Tesla was the bigger and more prestigious name, but Rivian has a much greater opportunity to grow as a company. Of course as a result I feel Rivian may be riskier due to that.

I am really unsure of what to do, as when I first applied I did not think I would even get a call back from either company. The only reason I lean Rivian is because I was born and raised in the SF Bay Area and if the company does become a dominator in the EV market it will be better for me, however I feel with having Tesla on my resume I open myself up to better career opportunities in the future."

1375,Road to a Job in Tech Sales?,careerguidance,"&amp;#x200B;

I recently transferred to a top ten university from a community college as a mechanical engineering major. With the ambition of breaking into either aerospace or automotive design. I decided to go to a CC mostly as a cost-cutting measure, I had the accolades in HS but figured ""if it was all the same, why pay for all 4-years?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, it's not all the same, at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

After spending my first ""actual"" semester at a 4-year; joining clubs, and passing my courses, I figured that it would be a good idea to start the process of applying to internships. So after sending an ungodly amount (200+) of resumes with no dice I decided to talk to the guys in my career center (I pay money to go to this place, right?) and they spin me a very telling tale: 

&amp;#x200B;

It was an hour-long meeting but it boiled down to ~~""ur a fuckin loser lol""~~ ""Being that you're from a community college, you immediately wash your ""desirability"" to employers as you haven't actually been receiving the education from the school you say you're from."" They tried to dance around it but the headline was basically ""You're just some guy from community college and businesses don't take too kindly to that."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So during the winter break, I did some soul searching, thinking about the decisions that have led to my current set of circumstances and it finally lead me to decide to pivot from engineering. I know I KNOW that it's not the end of the world if you don't end up with an internship before you graduate but after everything I went through to get to this point, I don't really care anymore. Melancholy aside, the purpose of this post (as you might've guessed) is me asking specifically how do I get into sales, specifically tech sales? From the light amount of research that I've done, sales is a lot more flimsy with their qualifications when it comes to what kind of education you have; HOWEVER that it comes with the asterisk that you have to have the ability to demo and truly understand the thing that you are selling which can require a degree in a stem related degree (although from what I read its not a necessity). 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, one of the main secret reasons I'm willing to make this change is that one of my best attributes is that I'm actually quite sociable compared to a lot of engineers. I'm communicative and I can generally keep teams moving forward even in the event of conflicts, both internally and externally. And I'm willing to bet that this is a good mix of skills to have so I'm hoping that this is more than a pipe dream compared to my initial plans. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I making sense or should I just keep with my original plan?"
1376,How do you squash the feelings of anxiety or nervousness when switching careers?,careerguidance,"I'm currently in non-profit work, but transitioning into the education and teacher field. It's something that unless the pandemic never occurred I'd probably never pursue. But, after having gotten laid off during the height of COVID-19, it allowed me time to think about my future and career aspirations. While I'm excited about being and becoming a teacher, a part of me is also sad that I may face never given my current industry more of a shot. Generally, there is lots of reasons for me to switch to the new path I've decided. The transition will be easier, they'll pay for a masters degree and I'm in an environment where the transition will be slow but aided by a fellowship program.

That being said, as I start to ramp up my commitment to this newfound industry, I'm starting to get some anxiety or what I can call doubt. A part of me is hesitant and almost wonder daily if what I'm going down is beneficial.

In general, I'm happy with where my life has got me to, but a part of me is unsure if I'll be in a better place two or three years from now.

I found out my company is going through a merger with another company, and they expect the deal to be completed in February. This was not disclosed to me during my interview or when I accepted my offer. 

They've told me they have no idea if my position will survive the merger because they're waiting until everything is finalized before they start making those decisions. I was told my role was a critical hire and that at this point they were only hiring for roles they expected to survive the merger (but my boss was also under the impression that we wouldn't be integrating systems until January 2023) so I have no idea if this is BS or genuine. If everything goes according to plan we will be switching to their systems (something I have no experience with) and their team is 3 people while mine is 2 (including myself).  They've repeatedly stated that the purpose of the merger is for growth and not to cut costs, but my role is one that is likely to result in redundancies (payroll/HR).

Has anyone been through a situation where they were hired just before a merger? I feel like regardless of what happens my first month will be pointless since we will either be switching over their systems (where I would have to re-learn everything anyway) or I will be laid off. Should I restart my job search now and accept an offer if one comes or should I wait to see what happens with the merger?"

I've been working as a blue collar worker in North Jersey at my family's business for about 8 years. It's a scale company, where 90% of my job is traveling to customers (manufacturers, labs, etc.) with lots of weights and verifying their scales are accurate and calibrating if need be. Some repairs and even less networking stuff here and there, but that's the meat and potatoes of it.

It's a necessary industry but not very lucrative (eg. Equipment manufacturers actually publish articles about how difficult it is to find long term technicians considering the job's physicality, breadth of knowledge required, and relatively low pay).

After 8 years I'm making just under $43k per year, which just isn't cutting it for me anymore.

1390,How do I respond to a performance review from a supervisor I've never met?,careerguidance," I received a performance review via an electronic database from my ""supervisor"" today. This person is new(er) to their role and has worked for the organization for about 6 months. I've never met them. they've never reached out to me via phone call, email, etc.

The person in their role prior was likewise unavailable as a direct supervisor. I interacted with that person twice; on interview day and once via Zoom at the beginning of the pandemic. This seems to be the culture of this specific department within this organization; a public school if that is important to feedback.

Today's performance review provided at most one sentence (sometimes only a ""meets expectation"") for 5-6 different performance criteria. One of the criteria was labeled ""needs improvement"" with written feedback that was generic - something along the lines that I should do better at my job.

I'm seeking guidance on how to approach this supervisor. They have no working knowledge of my job or the intricacies of the duties I do within my field of expertise. I am licensed and certified by a state agency as proof of my qualifications. The job itself is one in which the ideology is that this job is a ""practice profession"" - like a doctor who is always learning how to become more skilled in their profession by time spent in the field, additional training and education, etc.

I'm frustrated that a person who I have never met nor who has ever seen my work is giving me a performance evaluation. My assumption is that all performance reviews they gave were based on feedback from a peer. I'm frustrated that the label of ""needs improvement"" has been used when the expectation itself IS that a person in my position should always be active in improving their skills.

How do I approach this supervisor to address the lack of awareness on their part, the unethical practice of using feedback from a peer to develop performance reviews for all others on the team, and stress that the ""needs improvement"" is not a fair label?"

Last year I took a risky lateral move, it was a really smart decision. 

I made just shy of 200k, which includes 401k match. I had to hustle sales for like 3 months and for the rest of the year it was like a self running business.  I quarterback a few large projects but for the most part have a lot of time on my hands.

I'm bored. I've been bored for a few years now and just stay for the money. 

I cant even tell if I make that much relative to my role and location. My base salary is extremely low for my market. 

I've looked around and most people in my position make 100-140K base and OTE of 140k for commissions, so 280k. 

I've read that sales jobs with high bases offset them with unrealistic quotas. 

I'm also kinda grateful for what I do make. In terms of book smarts, I barely graduated at a mediocre school, and polling ivy league friends I've been making more than them for years.

1395,Career redirection into therapy a good idea?,careerguidance,"Hello, looking for some advice and guidance if there is any out there on this. Happy to answer any follow-up questions if needed. 

Background

I am in my early 30s, in Alberta Canada, working as essentially a office manager/executive assistant/project coordinator for one of the big 5 banks. I have been working for them for 5 years and am at the glass ceiling of admin roles. If i want to grow and move up i need to either relocate to Toronto ( ugh ) or move to a different role. 2 years ago i realized if i wanted to stay with the company i would need to start networking and building relationships to get promoted to a different team and did that for 2 years to go into the only role i had interest it, a Human Resource Business Partner. I needed the networking because, despite my past work history in HR and my skills in communication and project management, i have a Bachelors Degree in English/History - no formal education in HR. The job was finally posted and despite my managers support, excellent past performance, many advocates by others for support of me doing the job, completing 11 HR certificate courses on my personal time, and an outstanding interview, i was passed over. I am now reflecting on what it is i actually want to do, instead of focusing on 'what can i do in this company'.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Redirection Idea

I have, for the past 7 years, a passion for mental health. I read everything on the topic i can get my hands on, i trained and now volunteer as a crisis text responder for Kids Help Phone, and i have been told on innumerable occasions that i should be a therapist or councillor. Now that i am taking a step back to look at my life and what i want to come next, i am considering going back to school to become a therapist. a big and long project that would take time and money as i would need to continue a full time job to accomplish it. I have done research and believe i would be able to accomplish this by;

Specifically at Athabasca University (Online Courses): taking 3 prerequisite undergraduate courses, completing a 18 credit Graduate Diploma of Counselling, then doing a Masters of Counselling  which includes a practicum to provide work experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice Request

Is there anyone who has done this themselves and have advice or guidance on the industry, education and job?

Is this the right way to go about this career change?

Specific to Alberta - Once you have the Masters of Counselling is it translatable to work in BC or other provinces?

Anyone else made a massive career change late in life and have advice?"

I could be interested in another startup or even a VC firm. Baseline requirements would be remote and making at least 100K/year. 

Any thoughts on position titles, companies, salary etc?

1397,Recent grad confused about asking for references vs reference letters + should I have references ready before or after the interview?,careerguidance,"Recently graduated from uni and have been casually looking for jobs. I somehow got an interview offer that was scheduled on short notice. I don’t have any references or anything prepared at all so I’m scrambling to figure everything out in less than 48 hours. 

My main questions are:

1. Difference between asking someone to be a reference vs asking for a reference letter.

When asking for references from my previous professors, which one am I asking for, for them to be my reference or for them to write me a reference letter? What’s the difference? If I ask them to write me a letter that I then give to the potential employer, does that mean the employer won’t have to contact the prof directly? Or will they still want to talk to them, ask them specific questions, etc?

2. Do I have to ask my reference to be my reference every time prior to when I have an interview? especially if it might be over the course of some months that I’m looking for a job?

3. Since this is my first professional interview and for a job I’m not qualified for I don’t really expect to get the job. And I haven’t been sending out that many applications so this might be my only interview this month. Should I even bother asking my profs for references before the interview? Or will I be asked to provide a list of references during the interview? I'm not even sure that the profs I have in mind to ask will accept, since I don't know any of them that well but did well in their classes.

Thanks in advance."
1398,How can I nail my second video interview?,careerguidance,"So I had a very positive phone interview today with a company that I'm very interested in joining.

We already discussed the job responsibilities, schedule, advancement, as well as some of the perks and benefits of working there. I also mentioned my enthusiasm and interest in the company many times. So, what else could I bring up with the hiring manager that would help finalize my application and get me in the door?

I’m a recent grad starting a back office role at a BB firm very soon, but I am already considering switching into the consulting industry after a year if I end up not enjoying the job (I’ve been warned about the monotony and lack of exit ops that comes with the role, and consulting seems like it would be a better fit for me personally).

I’m curious if anyone has any advice on how to get into consulting (ideally MBB), and what my chances are as someone with a year of work experience (and from a non-target school) competing against fresh grads from top universities.

Also, should I consider Big 4 consulting, even though it may mean less prestige, if it matters, than working at a BB or MBB?

For work I am the only one on my team that has learned several new programs and have created ways to use them to improve the company. The ideas were then given to other team members to run with them constantly asking what to do.

I have talked to my manager about getting a promotion but he left, and I got a new manager. At this point I don't see it happening. Before he left the manager said I needed to lead more projects. In the 5 years I have not been assigned to a single project. I just took over and saved multiple after near failure.

Basically had no training, I’m her only direct report and yes I’ve messed up but I’ve had literally zero training. She will show me some huge process once and expect me to have memorized the whole thing from her rushing through it not even letting me do it at all. Overall not a great leader. Anyway, I was a little worried when she said this job wasn’t for me but then here a week later she puts in her notice. She said they are hiring a second position the same as mine-a former temp employee who did it for 6 months and has experience, although this time hired as permanent, who will pick up the extra work until a new manager comes in. Now she claimed the GM wanted 3 people in this department anyway, however I’m worried that they’ll bring back this former employee, hire a manager and tell me to get lost. Am I just overthinking this? It’s entirely possible my manager really is just leaving and there’s no sinister plans for me but I worry. Everyone else likes me except for her, I just don’t know what she expected when I got so little training and little slip ups ruin her day."

1 year as a business planning analyst @ a tech giant (remote)

1 year as a BI developer (glorified analyst) @ a consulting company (remote)

It is listed/titled as a ""director"" position, but I'm inclined to think this is because it's more of an individual contributor role that might require some autonomy or clout with external engagement.

1437,"My ex-boss started a false rumor about me that I'm concerned is costing me work, so how do I fix it?",careerguidance,"I apologize in advance if I've smoothed over details (for anonymity) that might raise any further questions, but...

I'm a reporter who does a lot of freelance feature writing, among other things. Lately, I've run into a bunch of weird situations that I'm having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around.

A few years ago, I was a contributing editor/permalancer type for a large outlet. My work was both popular in terms of both reception and traffic, including a bunch of instances of being the top story of the day across the publisher's whole network. But now, after a bunch of staff turnover, I've had a peculiar amount of trouble getting pitches to come even close to landing with most of the editors from the old place at the new places they've settled. Actually, it's worse than that: About 90% of them completely ghosted me. I'm under no illusions that we are/were friends, but they had all previously been very easy to get in touch with.

For a while, I was at a loss for what the heck could have happened to cause this. After all, it's not that they weren't receptive to pitches; it's that most of them ghosted me outright regardless of what I was reaching out to them about, including tips that I figured would interest them to work on themselves, which they had previously welcomed.

Then one day, out of nowhere, it hit me: I had been told that, a few years ago, when one editor who had controlled the purse strings left the old place announced that they were leaving, I sent a short—but polite and simple—email asking if they had a few minutes to talk on the phone to clear up the conflicting stories I had been given about why my pay/responsibilities had been reduced previously. They sent a weird reply pretending to not know what I was talking about while making it clear that they knew exactly what I was talking about and tried to blame the editor who was actually editing and fielding my pieces/pitches.

But that night, they also went to dinner with co-workers from the place she was leaving and told at least one person—the editor I usually interfaced with—that I was sending her harassing emails. I immediately offered to send the ""direct"" editor copies of the actual pair of emails (one from me, one from the departing money-controlling editor), but they said there was no need. I figured that was the end of it: I never heard about it again, I socialized with a bunch of the people who would soon ghost me a couple months later at an industry party with no signs of any problems, and that was about it. Or so it seemed until, over the course of a few months, most of the people there started ghosting me. Also, at least one other reporter had made public comments about a reporter they knew but wouldn't name badmouthing me in a vague enough way to make me worried it's related and the bullshit rumor spread beyond a small circle.

There are also some potentially related factors, like that ""direct"" editor I was interfacing with repeatedly commented to me and at least one mutual friend about them being able to get me work at their current site, both as a salaried staffer (what they said to me) and as a freelancer (to the mutual friend) when it was a promise they couldn't keep. This person's lies tend to be more out of a desperate need to avoid confrontation more than anything, so they're hard to read. The last time I managed to get them to talk to me, though, their tone went from ""very sympathetic but didn't think they could help"" to ""lashing out at me in a way I've never seen them act before.""

When I've run the situation by both media reporter/media critic friends and other reporter friends, they think that people having heard and believed the ""harassing emails"" crap is only explanation that makes sense. But nobody has a good answer as to how to nip it in the bud if it's keeping me from getting work. Some have said send a fake apology to the lying editor, which feels like a terrible idea to me. Some have said just chalk it up to being unanswerable and go back to therapy to deal with the anxiety it causes (which I am), but they have no answers to the practical professional concerns. Others think I should just send a blunt but nonspecific email asking what's up to someone I hadn't tried asking about it before.

And even though I, as mentioned, agree that the therapy side of things is excellent advice, the fact that I have indications it's been spreading makes me sure that there's a practical matter that needs to be dealt with to make sure I'm not losing out on work I would otherwise be getting. If it was just one outlet where I'd be expecting to get work based one working with the people there previously, it would be easier to let it be completely. But knowing there are indications that it's spread out to other people? That could badly damage my career and I'm incredibly worried about it for that reason.

What the heck do I do? Thanks."
1438,Should I accept this counteroffer or just move on to my new role?,careerguidance," Hi guys,

Currently working at a client-based e-commerce digital marketing role and accepted an offer for a digital marketing specialist role at an agency. I never worked in an agency before and want to broaden my experience and I just don't have much interest left in the industry I'm in which is industrial &amp; warehousing equipment

I'm really stuck between starting a new role in the agency or accepting a counteroffer from my current company. I've listed out pros and cons for each option. Can I please get some input on which option you guys think would be better?

Accepting counteroffer with a new client based position

Pros:

\- Higher Pay, Closer to home, Manager position with 2 direct reports, Good boss, Shorter hours ( 9-5), Business is potential growing, Complete control over eCommerce Space, Fewer hands-on work.

Cons:

\- No mentor to help, boring industry, not motivated as I'm no longer interested in the industry/products, no digital marketing team to bounce off, lots of self-learning and self experimenting, No experience in managing so the risk of not being able to do the role well

Move to a new role at an agency:

Pros:

\- New working environment, work within a digital team where I can bounce off thems, gain hands-on experience, exposure to different industries, have mentors that can direct and teach me, flexible working arrangement (WFH and office), Hands-on works I can learn more technical skills

Cons:

\- Less Pay, Far from home, longer hours (8:30 - 5:30),  agency work-life can be more stressful, won't have the freedom to do my own research, discover new things since I won't have that much free time at work, not a manager role and company is not as big as my current company.

FYI, I'm 26, I've been in this company for a year but have worked in the same industrial industry for the last 4 years.

Please let me know which option would be better off for me?"

1443,How do I make a change in my career given my current stagnation in academia?,careerguidance,"I [25M] graduated with a Masters in Science from an excellent university in the US, one of the best for computer engineering. My subspecialty during the course of my Masters was building AI systems. AI is a pretty hot field in the market right now, lot of my peers in univ got hired at top companies with great salaries. 

I tried my hand at two of these top companies, but got rejected at the final rounds. Instead of working up to it and preparing for more interviews, I deluded myself into thinking that my lack of knowledge in the field was what was hampering me. I decided to give academia a chance, thought it would be excellent to continue to shore up my knowledge, publish papers, gain a PhD and land a prestigious job. I continued working at my university for a research lab for mediocre pay. Over the course of 1½ years, I have become very disillusioned by academia. The environment is hyper-competitive and intellectual. I feel like I'm a pretty decent engineer, but I'm mediocre at best when I compare myself to the PhDs and Postdocs who work in my univ. Now I regret sticking to academia and feel like I should've just continued applying to jobs.

Making a career switch is next to impossible for me. I am a foreign national working in the US, and due to visa restrictions that grant me a very narrow window for switching jobs, I can't switch my current job, or quit because I have student loans to pay. I feel like I'm increasingly stagnating myself in academia where companies won't like hiring someone like me with a more academic background. It's become a Catch-22 situation in some ways. My parents aren't too happy with me, all my peers earn much more than me, and are already settling down in life while I'm still paying my loans. I live my life paycheck to paycheck, in a pretty shitty home far from family, alone basically.

I did nothing of the opportunities that were given to me, despite having been fortunate enough to receive them in the first place. I feel like I'm becoming increasingly stagnated. How should I even begin making a change in my career?"

1447,How do I go about transferring positions within the same company?,careerguidance,"Right now I’m working for a really good company that’s growing like crazy, but my current position just doesn’t pay enough and I’m barely using my degree. I’m wondering if anyone has some advice on how to go about asking to move/interview for new positions? My manager who handles transfers lives in a different state than me and I rarely talk to him which makes it challenging. 

My options are to move positions or leave the company because everyone with the same title gets paid the same amount based on number of years worked. The yearly raises hardly make a dent in my salary so it’s really not worth staying in the same position. 

Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you!"

1450,Asking for a raise?,careerguidance,"Greetings!

I have never asked for a raise at a job before, so I am a bit gun-shy about it.

I just celebrated my three year anniversary at my job, and after being hired I have consistently worked hard, come up with new ideas, and exceeded expectations of my role, especially after COVID began. I work at a small UU church, and in mid-2019 I brought up the idea of live-streaming the sermons there so folks could still be involved from home (since a large number of the congregants are 65+). After covid hit, this morphed into me being their tech guru and setting up live streaming via Zoom for the entire worship services. We briefly went to hybrid worship services a couple months ago (we just re-closed due to COVID, and are online only through the end of January), which led to more work for me setting up a workspace in the sanctuary and running hybrid services each Sunday that are much more involved than I ever imagined doing. I have tried to roll with all this well, and have had excellent reviews and feedback from my boss, coworkers, and the board here. I have received a 3% raise at the end of each church fiscal year (which runs from July to June of the following year) along with my fellow staff members, but still feel I am underpaid.

I am concerned about the timing of asking for a raise, as the holidays have just passed. Each year the basket from a couple Sundays is split among the staff as a bonus, and the past two years the congregation has been *very* generous with us. I would hate to possibly seem ungrateful by asking for a raise after that, would it seem that way to you if you were in my bosses shoes?

Our church is a part of the UUA, which releases salary guidelines each year. When I dug into the newest ones, I found that my position is a combination of around 3 of roles they listed. For the least skilled role I am on the midpoint of the salary, for the next skilled role I am on the low end, and for the most skilled it is about 10k more than I am currently making for the minimum amount.

I currently make just under $17/hr, would asking for a raise to $20 (or more) be unreasonable?

Also, how is the best way to ask? Since we are remote for the time being my options are via Zoom or email. I am leaning towards email, since I am much more eloquent that way, and so I can have a written transcript of the conversation.

Thank you!"

1452,Should I pursue a DPT degree or a masters in business?,careerguidance,"Hi, I’m 24m and I have been struggling with this decision related to which career path to take for about a year now. It has been on my mind and is causing me a great deal of stress. Ultimately I just want a stable life and happy family one day.

I graduated college about a year ago and got my degree in exercise science. I was pretty set on becoming a physical therapist and took all the necessary classes to get into PT school. Pt school is a 3 year program after undergraduate. Ive always loved exercising, being involved in fitness and sports but honestly did not observe a lot of physical therapy first hand.  After college, since last year, I started working at a physical therapy clinic and shadowing/ finding more about the profession. Also, as planned I spent a bunch of money and applied to several physical therapy schools. I began to have reservations about PT when I learned how expensive the three year degree is, how there isn’t much upward mobility in the profession, the relatively low ceiling for pay, and how clinics are run. I also wasn’t sure if a job interacting with different people all the time/being customer service friendly and being on my feet is something that I could do for a long time. I was kinda in a bad spot/ depressed for a while because other factors too.

Although I already applied to schools I felt very hesitant to pursuing physical therapy. I looked for other alternatives and found a masters program for 1year in business. I always loved business too, and almost majored in it during undergrad. This program is full time and the average starting salary is the same, if not higher than a physical therapist. Also, I began taking online classes related to the program and honestly I love them. The statistics is something Ive always loved. Anyways, I got accepted into that prestigious program at one of the top universities and paid my deposit because the deadline was quick. 

Now, I heard back from a state school for physical therapy and I got in. The deadline to make my decision is soon. I feel torn. Am I making a huge mistake by throwing away something Ive been working towards for years (physical therapy). I am scared of potential regret. What if I end up hating my new field, what if I miss PT, what if…etc. The state school for PT isnt super expensive but the same issues in the field of physical therapy are on my mind but Im sure if I wanted to make it work I could. I love exercise and fitness but am pretty sure I love the performance side rather than rehab. which is different from PT. PT is a huge commitment and I would be locked in because the time commitment/ cost if school. With the business degree I could do it for a while and maybe do something else down the line? Im just very lost. Any advice would be much appreciated"
1453,Certification or finish BA for data analytics?,careerguidance,"I was fired last summer for missing work due to a medical issue. I had planned on leaving anyway so I just let it happen.

I started looking for a new job in November. I've been having a hard time even getting interviews despite years of related experience and some college. I don't know if this is due to my lack of a degree, my resume itself, how I left my previous job (employers wouldn't even know that at this point, right?), or something else entirely.

I'm considering finishing my bachelor's in data analytics. I need 15 classes to finish and I'm not thrilled about taking on more debt, nor am I certain on how I'll continue to pay my mortgage if I go this route.

I'm also considering taking some certification classes for SQl/Python. I'm not sure how much a certification would help my chances as I've never known anyone to do this.  I'm also not sure what makes a specific certification more valuable than any other, beyond the price I have to pay. I found a google course with the subjects I'm interested in  and I'm considering starting, but I was hoping for some insight from someone who has gone this route?"

I chose that degree as it seems more general so I can get my foot in the door at (most) careers I would desire. 

I recently discovered I have a strong desire to grow and improve the community (county) I will be living in. I already applied to a job in the county as a “Fines Collection Assistant” which I’m hoping will get my foot in the door and keep bills paid if I get it.

1459,How do you ask a manager in a job you've only been in four months to be a reference?,careerguidance,"I started a new job four months ago and I'm still within my six month probation period. Unfortunately for various reasons things have not gone well and overall this job isn't for me and I'm a bad fit for the company. Despite this I still go in and do my best even if I don't always get it right (lack of training was an issue).

I was in my previous job for eight years, I left on good terms with them and before I left the door would be open for me if I wanted to come back. As I'm unhappy I contacted them last month and reapplied for my old job and they're going to offer it to me but I still have to go through the process of having references.

On the application form I put down the name of my line manager and in the interview they said I should make them aware that I've applied for another job as they intend on contacting them soon for a reference. 

My question is how (if there is a good way) should I speak to my line manager about this? My line manager knows there have been problems in my current job but I don't think they were aware of the extent of my unhappiness and they're not aware that I've applied for other jobs. I realise being there for four months will not do me any favours either and I'm not expecting a good reference. I'm also worried about potential backlash too. 

I plan on just being honest. I'm going to say that I don't think this job is for me, pre-warn them that I've applied for my old job and ask if they're willing to be a reference. If they say no I'll have to rethink things."

1462,Awkward - Got a raise after 2 years and all of a sudden I got a job offer somewhere?,careerguidance,"Some background info:

I am an IT guy and currently working remotely from home Monday to Friday and 9-5. I rarely need to do any overtime or after hours and that's the best part of my job. It gives me huge flexibility as I can work and look after my family at home. I work in a smaller company so it's a tight-knit environment. The downside is we lost a couple of major clients recently as well two major team members left us who were super critical to our business.

Storytime:

My boss called me last week and he decided to give me a pay raise since my last one from two years ago. He gave me a reasonable 15% raise but he ended up giving me a total of 25% as I asked him for more. He then asked me to make sure to stay with them long-term and he would definitely give me another one next year or so. I was/am thrilled about it but I know my new salary is only a little above the current median of my field.

Fast forward a week to now - my ex-boss who moved on to a much larger organization last year reached out and asked if I am interested to work in his new company. He's extremely intelligent (I mean smart AF!) and he was my mentor when I first joined my current company. We have a great work relationship so he often would look after me on different things. I told him I got a pay raise and he promised he could give me a little more and asked if I am interested to work with him. The only catch here is I need to be in the office once a week (2-hour drive roundtrip) and the workload at his place should be a bit more than what I usually deal with.

Would you guys take the offer and work in the new place or stay put and take the wait and see approach?"
1463,How to answer “why do you want to leave your current job?” interview question.,careerguidance,"So I’m a bit rusty on all of this. I’ve worked for my current company for 14 years. 

This is a common question asked during interviews and I’m just not sure how to answer this. I’d like to be genuine but rather not horrify my interviewer.

The honest response would be:
- My CEO makes horrible business decisions on whims that negatively affect the entire company.
- I’ve been promoted 3 times and each time it was not a clean break. I keep my previous responsibilities and the pay increase has been minimal.
- I have not gotten a pay raise or compensation in 4 years. 
- My upper management makes me feel like my job is unimportant/unwanted even though I know it is extremely important (regulatory compliance). They have a laissez-faire attitude towards quality and regulatory compliance in general, which rolls down hill. When I try to correct issues I get immense pushback.
- My upper management asks me about doing illegal things - well aware they are illegal and what the chances of us getting caught would be.
- I am now expected to do my normal duties (again, work of 3 people) along with working in production because they can’t/won’t hire more production assemblers.

Obviously I can’t really say any of that….

Perhaps something along the lines of lack of possibilities of growth and poor leadership/working environment?"

1469,I have pivoted careers many times but still stuck at 30. How can I find what I want to do?,careerguidance,"  

So like many of us, I had no clue what I wanted to do when I went off to college at 18. I wanted an “easy” career path since I always envisioned myself as a homemaker vs career woman. I ended up majoring in psychology, with the possibility of becoming a therapist. Due to a few life events, I barely graduated but finally did with a subpar GPA. I did not prepare for grad school and knew I did not have any skills with just a bachelors, so I decided to enroll in beauty school. Easy right? Completed the program, began working in the field, but was not fully aware that it can take some time to earn a livable wage. I left the field after 6 months because I needed to earn more money and wasn't invest 100%. I began working as an account manager for a small company making 35k. 

While happy to get a pay increase, the job was dead-end and still not enough money.  Went back and forth on what to do but decided to get into tech only due to the salaries and rather quick entry to the field. I quit my job and decided to attend a full time GA Bootcamp for UXD.  I was on a time crunch to get a position quickly after the program ended since I was unemployed and took out loans. Never got a position in UXD but I accepted a role as a systems consultant at a small software company making 50k. Company did not have the proper resources so I switched to another software company after 6 months taking a software support role making 63k. There I learned some technical troubleshooting, project management and more about general business operations. Finally, I switched to my current role as an implementation specialist software making 60k. 

While I am happy at the progress I have made over the past few years, I am completely unfulfilled working in tech and having trouble figuring out what my next steps should be. This has been apparent with previous managers and in job hunting as It appears I don’t know what I want. I am only getting offers for entry level positions and essentially starting over at each company I have been at. Not really able to move up. I cannot take a drastic pay cut  and I am not sure if grad school would be worth it now. I truly enjoy counseling/working with others through problems but unsure of a job field that will check that box and come with a decent salary. I have thought and/or dabbled with the idea of starting a travel agency, becoming a real estate agent ( took a few courses), HR, career advisor event planning, the list just goes on. Not sure if these are casual interests or something I will dedicate myself to. Any ideas on how to go about this?"

Obviously I'm applying for it again, 6 months late.

1476,Should I quit my job?,careerguidance,"Just looking for other perspectives--I'd appreciate hearing what other people would do in my position.

After five months unemployed, I got a position in a prestigious organization--and then weeks after being hired most of the senior team resigned, including my manager. I learned that the head of the organization is abusive and the team couldn't handle this person anymore. There's no room for me to go to another department. 

The organization's leadership protects this person from the consequences of what are likely illegal actions, and I do not expect meaningful remediation for any future issues. I later learned that my predecessor resigned after the job severely affected their mental health. With most of the team gone, my position requires I have continual interaction (often one-on-one) with the abusive boss without much support. He's already challenging me, steamrolling my ideas, and dramatically changing the project he'd approved only a few months earlier. I've heard that he can be physically intimidating, verbally demeaning, retaliatory (e.g. blocking people out of career opportunities over minor disagreements), quick to anger, and quicker to fire people. He's even been barred from other organizations we work with because of how he treats people. 

I feel like I've been handed a poisoned chalice.

I'm two months in and I don't have any other employment lined up. My Ph.D. is in the humanities and I suspect I'd have to retrain if I were to find a decent paying job elsewhere. Part of me is okay with that idea: I'm not passionate about the subject, I had to move away from my partner for this job, and I do not like my boss or have respect for his work or how he treats people. However, I'm also tied down with a year-long lease in an expensive area and I'm getting older (in my early 30s) without much career experience or connections. 

I almost wish that I'd get fired, but I don't think they can easily part with me given how skeletal the team has become due to my boss. 

Anyhow, I'd appreciate any of your thoughts--I feel a little trapped, but maybe you can all help me see other possibilities."

1479,What kind of career to pursue?,careerguidance,"I’m looking for advice on what line of work to look for next. I’ve been working as a horticultural technician for a few years. I’ve become quite disillusioned and burnt out from working among the public during the pandemic as well as the work being unfulfilling and needlessly stressful, and would like a job that can be done remotely. I am only a high school graduate, and have previously worked as a courier and in hospitality. I am open to certification courses and whatnot to increase my chances of being hired somewhere. Due to my limited experience, I’m not sure what would be a good fit for me. My main wants are minimal stress, flexibility, and limited human interaction. I would say some of my strengths are that I am naturally detail-oriented and organized. I don’t mind and even at times enjoy tedious tasks. I’m usually good at researching and figuring things out on my own and finding ways to increase efficiency whatever the task or job is. My shortcomings are probably more numerous, I have severe anxiety disorders and am not a “people person.” I can fake politeness when needed though. I also more or less hate working, I save as much as I can and work as little as possible. Early retirement is an aspiration though, so if I had a better career path I think I could tolerate working more in order to achieve that. I’m in my early 30s if that’s at all relevant. A big reason for preferring a remote position is, probably like a lot of people these days, I would like to move closer to my family and move out of the city back to a more rural and cheaper setting, and avoiding a commute would be a big plus.

1491,Am I coming across as weak?,careerguidance,"Hello, I’ve noticed for awhile now that as I am working on my confidence that I really hate when people say it’s okay when I’m not apologizing or apologetic in anyway (at least I don’t think).

I used to apologize and say sorry a lot, but as I’ve become more confident I’ve focused on not being apologetic for my opinions or things outside of my control. I’ve also tried to reel it in on apologizing immediately after mistakes when they aren’t needed, so I can prove I’ve learned rather than seem discouraged by the failure. 

After all that work I’ve put in, I am afraid I still come across as timid or apologetic. In conversation with certain management, they say “that’s okay” like trying to reassure me when we are just having a conversation or I’m stating my thoughts. I very possibly could be misreading the interaction, but it just seems like a strange thing to say if I’m not being apologetic. 

This is not completely disrupting my life, but it is a bit of an annoyance as I am working closer with someone who does this to me fairly often. It just seems to throw me off a little. 

Is this a normal thing, am I just overthinking, or is there probably some insecurities still slipping out that I need to work on?

I know there isn’t a lot to go off of here, so if you have a similar experience or advice, I would love hear about it!"
1492,How do I get past this mental block of not wanting to work for companies?,careerguidance,"Hi All

Sorry for the odd subject - I'll clarify a bit.

Back in 2008 I was let go from a large film visual effects company. My wife and I had accepted jobs in France, had rented out our house, then a week before departing the French company said ""Nevermind, we hired locals.""

So jobless, and with tickets, we went to France anyway for a few weeks, then came back to the US where we found a few months work again in film, on set. 

This role ended. I then took a job at a very large well known animation company - 18 months later Im laid off because they are shutting down the office location.

I then get a job at a very large and well known GAMES company.  1 year later laid off because they are shutting down the office.

Next I take a job at an entertainment startup - 6 months in laid off because they are switching from content to software production.

I get very excited about a well paying 14 month contract doing an AR project for a bank - Only to be let go 3 weeks in because they pulled funding.

I then take a job at a small but cool and well established publishing company who laid me off the month my wife gave birth because they didn't want to pay parental leave (They actually TOLD me this)

After I tried starting my own company (Couldn't get proper funding)and since I have been contracting and treading water.

Basically I am trying to get a new job now, but the first step is always ""Make a list of companies you want to work for...""  I don't trust ""companies"" anymore. I guarantee you would have heard of some if not all of the companies I alluded to above - All big, well known places ""people really want to work at."" And I feel let down by all of them. They aren't companies you would think would be shutting down offices etc.

Im 44, and so exhausted form a decade of this back and forth and job search. I can't think of one company I want to work for, and I don't know what to do. ANyone else hit this wall , and how did you get past it?"

1495,What to respond to the salary question when there's not enough information online?,careerguidance,"I'm having an interview tomorrow and on the benefits doesn't even say anything related to pay to being with. And the position I'm interviewing for doesn't have really a define salary range where you can say things like ""oh I'm a PM they better pay me at least 80k"" or something like that. It really varies by company.

I've been doing some research online but the ranges that I see are way to wide. For example Glassdoor's estimate for that job posting goes from 37k to 73k. Other sites I've been looking for give some similar wide ranges, some from 48k to 83k and things like that. 

So I'm worried at what to say if they ask me about what my expected salary is because on previous interviews I had clearer range in mind. I don't want to give wide range so they don't low ball me but I don't know if I'll sound crazy if I put my range too high. Right now I'm doing something completely different to that position so my current salary isn't really good for guidance."

1502,Am I horrible for having used 6 sick days in a month ?,careerguidance,"
I work at a call centre job where I have the ability to work from home. I’ve been here for a little over a year and have never used a sick day until this past month.  I have good days where I force myself to do it for the money but most of the time that I'm there, I'm miserable and anxious. I spend most of my free time lately thinking or talking about leaving the job, but it's my first ""big girl"" job out of university and I have a salary, benefits and just moved out into my first apartment because of it. 
The job can be a bit taxing, and I have started to feel almost dreadful waking up in the morning to do my job. I am a good worker and I put in my all every time I am working. I would say that I am a resilient person, and I have always pushed through when I am stressed or anxious. 
However, this started when I took a mental health day. I had a lot of upset clients through my week, and some family issues that were pressing down on me. I have never taken a mental health day before. However, with so much that had been going on I decided why not, so I took a day off. I felt I needed it, as while outside I was putting on a cheery face, inside I felt everyones emotional punching bag. The following week I had some health issues of my own and took 3 days off to recover. However, later on in the month I took 2 more days off, simply because waking up I felt so anxious and restless, I didn’t want to do the job those days. 

I feel horrible for hating my job this much because a lot of my colleagues seem okay with it or enjoy it. As well, my boyfriend has a strong work ethic and never takes a sick day, I feel like I’m being pathetic when I can’t help but compare myself to him. I can't figure out what's wrong with me and why I feel the way I do. I feel trapped in the job because of how well it pays, but it's soul-sucking and it's taken a toll on my self-esteem. I feel useless, and have been looking for other jobs. In addition, I have taken some steps to advance my position within the job I have, however the progress is slow. 
Even then I feel like I’m starting to mentally check out when I do my job. 
I feel that if the job was not so obsessed with time attendance, tracking and recording how fast I go from call to call, meeting break times exactly and logging in and out, and I had the ability to not work 100% on the phones all the time I may not feel the way I do. However I have not been able to find a job yet to match that. I don’t know how to change my feelings towards this job."

1504,How can I find a job that's spiritually/financially fulfilling?,careerguidance,"As most people are that come to r/careerguidance, I'm trying to find that thing that sparks my soul and fills my pocket in the process.

For some background, I'm in my early 30s and engaged. My fiancé wants to plan a wedding, we want to have kids, and plan to buy a house in 2023. I'm an Army Veteran so I'm more confident about the house stuff, however, the strain of my fiancé and future wife not making her 6-figure salary following a baby creates some instability. There's a bit of an internal struggle between satisfying this human requirement to produce money to pay for **stuff** while feeding this deep longing for fulfilment. I can honestly say I don't require much external gratification so the societal requirement to make more and do more is laughable.

I've worked everywhere from the food service industry, education, security, construction, health care, and now working in the tech space with a transcript service company. I feel fulfilled by the interactions I have with the students who call in. It really does make me feel good to help people and create a space where we can connect at a deeper level. More recently, as jobs become available within my organization, I feel that the career options being presented to me are for money and not me. 

As I'm sure you can relate, I'm a complex being. I love helping and connecting with people with compassion and understanding, something I've cultivated through my eclectic spiritual practice. There is so much I know I'm capable of that doesn't show up on a transcript but it's impossible for me to articulate or know what I should be doing with all this intention. Anything that I think I have a knack for requires a huge formal education just for someone to say that I'm educated enough to do it. This is literally the problem I've been running into since I left the military and it's intensely deflating. Being denied opportunities because of my education has been a slap in the face, especially when I worked at the Department of Veteran's Affairs, where I couldn't make more than $30k.

Where does one go? I considered being a Life Coach and pursuing a certification to help others find their passions. Not that it would be an immediate change in my financial life but I would be taking steps toward doing what I love and building toward a passion. Maybe I need to meet with a coach myself lol?

TLDR: What work should I pursue that will satisfy the interpersonal connection with others that will also provide a decent salary to support my family?"

For context, I’m a consultant @ Accenture within their applied intelligence practice. I’ve been in the workforce for about 5-6 years but prior to finding my footing, I was incredibly lost &amp; didn’t really know where to get information about what to do with my life (career wise). Since then, I’ve built an expansive &amp;amp; diversified network of people from every industry that have helped guide me to where I am today.

1507,(Repost) Should I consider the job offer?,careerguidance,"Reposting for some replies:
So I recently got a job offer with an in state college for a grant funded position that has funding for 2 years. The grant in question is new and I would be on to assist with the finance ends of thing. I'd be making pretty much the same of what I make now with my current job which is a local gov job that I've been at for almost 6 years now.

Pro's would be that it's with a college that had experienced a lot of growth in the last few years, new experience of work, Once I'm there for a year pursuing my master would virtually be free, same type of work I do now just in a higher-ed setting.

Cons would be a little longer commute 45 minutes compared to 15 I have now, work load would be more for the same pay along with added responsibilities, grant funding isn't guaranteed so at 2 years it could or could not be renewed, and getting a raise would be hard because grants stipulate salary. Job security really is my biggest fear. The grant could be renewed, or not, or if what I'm doing isn't up to par I could be let go relatively easy."

1509,Should I change career?,careerguidance,"Hello. I'm a recent graduate with bachelor's degrees in business admin (marketing concentration) and video production. I figured I would synthesize these and create advertising or marketing content eventually. As I work in the field I find myself more and more disillusioned with the marketing field and less passionate about the medium of video. Further, I am extremely unenthusiastic about corporate advertising. I've worked in digital communications and newspaper for an HOA for a year now and this has only furthered my disillusionment. I've considered trying for an MLIS and pursuing librarianship but that seems not very lucrative. I have also considered something in IT but that would take a lot of basic education and training. Before this job I had considered a master's degree unnecessary but I'm beginning to reconsider that. But then again I'm not sure what to study. MBA is the obvious track but I'm not sure I want to study that. It would have been wise to really decide what I wanted to do before I jumped into college but I had a lot of pressure and earnestly thought I knew what I wanted. Is it possible that I've just had poor luck with employers? Should I stick with the marketing/comms career path and attempt to work for nonprofits or local government? Is going back to school for some master's program worth it? Any guidance, advice, or insight is appreciated."
1510,"Was told to expect a raise with transfer, didn't get it. How do I push for this?",careerguidance,"Hello everyone and thank you in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

My company has been awesome helping me make my transfer to another out of state office. It was a goal I set and they made it happen. They have paid for my transfer and all moving expenses so for that I am truly greateful.  

&amp;#x200B;

My current manager had a meeting with my soon to be manager and HR. When he was done he called me to give me the details of the transfer. Notably, he mentioned that I should be expecting a raise though not guaranteed. He pretty much hinted that I was being fairly underpaid and should expect a sizeable boost considering my performance and my almost 3 year tenure at my company.  So fast forward to yesterday, I was sent the official document to sign my transfer and to my disappointment, my pay rate remains the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make about 54k a year but when I search this role on Glassdoor I see that the average for my position is paying between 60-65k. I really bust my ass at this job and when looking at my performance my numbers show that I am a high performer - like top 5% among my position in my company. Don't get me wrong, for the most part my company is pretty great but having this whole underpaid thing hanging over my head is now making my work and efforts feel unenjoyable and unrewarded.

The first recruiter and I talked on Thursday morning and she mentioned scheduling an interview for this week. I haven't seen anything come from her since our phone call.

The 2nd called me Friday and we set something up (again different req number) for today actually, had to call yesterday as he had typo'ed my email address. so this is all good now

1513,"Resigned without offer to move countries, got counter offer, should I take it?",careerguidance,"Been wanting to move countries to be closer to my partner, I have raised it to my staffer multiple times over the past few years but the answer has always been a no for various reasons, ongoing commitments, no opportunities, require specific skill set etc. I generally like the work I do but it was becoming stifling and painful. Being apart for too long is not good for any relationship and I wanted to use a career break to reconnect and build a solid foundation with my partner. 

I resigned stating my desire to move and that pay could be better, mentioning that I had no offers because I wanted a break. In reality I have a few good job leads which I hope turn into offers soon, but anything can happen. The MD, who I have good relations with, said he had not heard about my desire and offered to open doors to make a country move possible. I am not sure about the pay but presumably it would be a higher gross, with similar take home, since it is in a Tier 1 city. 

Prospects wise the office there is smaller but a T1 city is exciting and opportunistic.

1519,What position do I choose? Stay in NY or move to TN?,careerguidance,"So I have recently been given a contingent offer from TSA (Transportation Security Administration). I applied for three positions:

2. Albany, NY Part-time ( $18.99 to $26.39 per hour)   
3. Nashville, TN Full-time ($40,571.00 to $55,691.00 per year)  


I currently love my landlords, but I hate living in New York. I hate the winter months, they are freezing and depressing. I've always wanted to move down south, but I am nervous to because of financial security and the unknown. I moved into this apartment in September 2021. So I have only lived here for about 4 1/2 - 5 months. There is no lease, but I would feel bad leaving them for a possibly risky opportunity to move to Tennessee. I know that Tennessee is the most southern state, but it's definitely warmer than New York. Looks like Nashville pays a tad bit more than the other offers do as well. 

I also have two labradors. So apartments are hard to come by when you own two large dogs, so that is something to consider if I move.

So the question is, do I follow through with the southern dream and possibly earn a bit more cash for it too? Or do I stay where I am in this apartment in a state I hate? There is no guarantee that TN will be the absolute best, but should I give it a go? Or play it safe and continue to stay in NY, maybe save more money, then go south?"

I’m 26 years old and have degrees in business management.

When I was 19 I started working in a bank. It was something I was really really good at, but I absolutely hated. About 4 years into the job, I got robbed and decided it was time to work on what makes me happy and what I’m passionate about.

After getting robbed, I quit and opened up an e-commerce store. I was literally working for pennies a day some days, but thankfully I saved nearly everything from working at the bank. 

It finally started to get some traction and my social medias surpassed 100k followers. My income wasn’t enough to live off of still and then the pandemic hit. Admittedly, this made me terrified about my future so I jumped back into banking.

I decided to work for a smaller bank that targets small businesses. This was a great move and this helped me learn so much. Because of this, I found a new passion in crypto and NFTs. 

In 2021, I made more money outside the bank then I would in a full year inside the bank. I made amazing plays on crypto where I turned $100 into nearly $100,000, my business was making about $2k-$5k a month and I felt like I was finally going to make it.

Yes, these were great accomplishments but I didn’t get to pay myself a single dime. I used the funds to keep diving into my passions further and to learn much more about everything.

Now, I am getting close to getting married and I’m absolutely terrified for the future. I’m scared that I’ll never be able to make the leap and work on my passions full time. I’m scared that I’ll be stuck in banking. I’m scared I’ll never actually give myself a full opportunity to work on what makes me happy. And I’m scared to continue to wake up everyday so unhappy and depressed. 

Looking for any advice, thank you!"

1525,Can someone help/ give advice on little brother who needs guidance who doesn't know what to major in?,careerguidance,"Help! So my brother is 26... with no real prospects. Went to college for associates but didn't finish... and now works manufacturing/assembly line jobs. .. Part of the problem is that,  1) he had always had a problem with schoolwork (I think undiagnosed dyslexia), 2) he doesn't know what to major in. 3) last time I talked about going back to school with him, he said that the lenders wanted him to pay back the student loans first (from the first time not finishing his associates) bc he had been gone too long...
So, as big sister,  who has gone back to school, networked, and in a much more successful career, I've tried coaching him to tell him what to tell him what to major in (STEM, accounting degrees), and of course with hard work,  majoring in them will pay off and set him up for success,  without having to worry about job security much.  
I know that of course,  you can only give advice to someone. And it's up to them to take action.  I don't think it's that he's 100% lazy; I'll explain. Coming from our background - We didn't grow up with a support system that told us ""the right majors to major in""   on top of that,  my parents weren't always the best,  so he's kind of insecure of himself... And embarrassed about doing school work bc he didn't get the proper support when he was younger...

So. My questions are,( I know that people can of course be successful with any degree,  but knowing him,  and knowing he doesn't really have any skills,  that's why I tried to steer him towards STEM degrees. Where you can learn them. And the job security  for those fields seem good. ), Has anyone known someone, or been in this situation themselves? How did you get out of it?
How did you find proper support as an adult to ""be a better learner"" as an adult? (Like kaplan?) Are there programs/ resources out there for adults who,  even though graduated high school, were basically still ""left behind""? And how to overcome that? 
Also... what did you find help you/ them finally get over that ""hurdle""?
Did you/they go back to school and/or were successful in another way??
Maybe there's an option I don't even know of? Like apprenticeships??
Or a life coach?? Our dad was around.. but...pretty much absent (thus why he lacks self esteem)..

Im just worried for my little brother bc, he's not going to have anyone left after us sisters are gone. So just want to encourage him to take building a career and wealth seriously, bc... it gets depressing at 30 😔... and it'll be harder to explain to employers that gap in why he took a long break and I just don't want him struggling for the rest of his life since we grew up poor and don't want to see that for him....

Any advice is appreciated! But actionable advice/items, resources even more so!"

1529,Struggling following graduation?,careerguidance,"Hi Everyone - I am from Scotland and graduated from my degree in 2019 doing cyber security with a 1st class hons and since moved towards doing a PhD in the same field at the start of 2020, I highly disliked the PhD straight from the beginning and after trying to persevere for over a year I left at the end of 2021.

I am in temporary work in a pretty decent job that I really don't mind in the slightest - the hours are good and the pay is decent but I am looking for something more degree relevant.

The main issue I feel I am running into is that it is firstly really difficult to come across jobs in Cyber security where I live which is obviously a problem, but the ones that I do apply for I am struggling when I get to interviews - I am totally fine with applications, skills tests, video interviews etc - its specifically face to face interviews where I fall flat.

I think part of the reason is most of my year of PhD study (took a 6 month break in between) was literature review and as a result I have forgotten alot of things - especially since I didn't enjoy it like I did with my undergraduate degree I feel I remembered alot less.

I am looking to still try get into computing but might stray away from the cyber security side of things, or I might even try go into a completely different grad program away from technology if a position becomes available.

I really don't know where to go from here on - I have lots of job experience - I have done lots of different things - public sector, private, education - I worked all the way through my degree studies all be it in alot of different field and worked 3 jobs during my final year of study.

Just looking for some advice if anyone has had a similar problem? I feel not going straight into employment following my first degree has hampered my job prospects and I have forgot alot too."

Hello, dear redditors, I know that you surely have read a lot of similar stories... Well, as I have past few days scrolling through internet looking for an advice. I thought that I would find something resourceful, but in the end of the day I maybe need to get the whole thing off my chest and write it down.

As of writing this, I am 20 years old man, who currently finished his first semester at uni. I chose major/minor English and Spanish with an interpretation specialization -- it was the worst decision of my life. Well, at the beginning, all seemed fine, I met up with new, interesting people interested in the same things as me, we went onto the meet-up courses etc., and everything and everybody seemed perfect, well, my classmates are perfect (clever, matured and hardworking, yet very friendly), so regarding the social side of uni, it is perfect. However, I slowly and steadily found out that not everything is as good as it seemed.

At the beginning, I loved my courses (I have had translationist courses, few computer and Corpus research courses and history and literature), as they started, I immediately jumped into learning new stuff, the theory given to us and all the things regarding the courses and it seemed very interesting. However, few months passed and I found out that I have been loosing all the interest in the field and that I completely forgot how to learn. I used to be at the top of my high school (although private), fighting for 1.2-1.4 grade average (and the financial stupendium) at very hard and competitive system full of very talented people (we had nearly 75% of our class taking part in the international full-mark IB diploma candidates, Active citizenship group leaders, DOFE groups and pther interesting things on top of their studies, I was basically surrounded with very talented people with near-eidetic/photographic memories or people with Menza-like statuses (great problem solving and math skills) or simply put very clever and talented kids, who excelled in various fields, while being able to comprehend everything immesely fast). The school was led completely in English and had a lot of self-study/short-term and semestrial projects for the overall evaluation. (It was supposed to prepare you for the system on the university).

I was not that good, not as much as them. I had to work hard for my grades and I was known more for my precision and dedication than any other thing, although I used to have very good pattern-recognition and recalling skills I had a great memory as well, I was able to memorize stuff, learn, comprehend, I excelled in Chemistry and Biology (I loved learning for the lessons) and English (due to my weird love for unusual words and grammar rules). We went along kinda fine, I was seen as an autistic kid, who knew a lot of stuff (that quiet kid, who is sitting in the books all the time - we had those large and fat Holt books)... And I simply loved to learn, I was able to learn and I was able to keep up with them due to my work and dedication and I kept perfecting all my projects all day (and night) sometimes until midnight or morning. At the end, I successfully graduated with A in my mother language and with B in English language, Spanish language and Biology, Chemistry and Art (jokes aside, haha).

But when I came to the uni, something inside of me broke, I am going into all the courses, lessons, seminars, but something is not the same as it used to be. I have to push myself to learn, I feel exhausted, but not as in the past, from work, I feel exhausted just by looking at all the theory of translation, all the ancient books, etc. I failed numerous tests, even though I have been learning, I could not recall a thing. I have been slowly realising, that it is not for me. That I have learned nothing and that this field does not interest me anymore, maybe it would have, if I had dedicated a little bit more time into it, but I have already dedicated a lot and it is still not enough, I used to have ""depressions"" by thinking about all those things and fields, which I will never know and master... And now, I have to master one... two fields and I cannot put myself together and learn, I am just sitting at my dorm staring into the literature and books about spanish and english literature, academic writing, IT translation, corpora and the theory of language, but I do not remember anything I studied, my memory is gone, my pattern recognition is gone. I do not feel the passion for learning I used to feel, when I was at high school and when I reflect the information I have learned, it gave me nothing... I moved nowhere in my life and my major, nor minor did not bring me anything concrete to life. I know that there is no such thing as wasted knowledge, but I feel, that this would suit the situation very well. I somehow passed few tests, well, I think because I have remembered few things, but now I do not know anything. It was a wasted half a year of my life. Where is the old me trying to be the best and learn all the stuff? Why I cannot find any joy at all in learning anymore? I am not that type of person, who goes to parties and then brags about life, drinks, etc. I tried to socialize a little bit and it worked, I met great people, attended few intelectual meetings (literature, language, etc.), but I just feel empty.

Am I just lazy? Am I just stupid? I am thinking about chaning my major to Ecology and Biology, since I always loved those subjects and some Math never killed anybody. I do not know, what I want to do. This just feels like a waste of time. Where is my pedantic and strict past-self willing to learn and comprehend everything? Am I just a drama queen? Should I change the field? Should I give up the uni?

I know, that based solely on Reddit, it is not good making a life decision, but I would just love to hear, what do you think. Any hate encouraged. Have a nice day and thank you for reading. If anyone would be interested in a little chat or in dropping a comment or advice, it would help me a lot (even maybe some vc with someone, who went through something similar)

1538,How to Switch careers without taking pay cut?,careerguidance,"Hi! 
So I’m currently an occupational therapist making $34/hr and would like to make a career change to something that allows me to work remotely. I’ve looked into some tech jobs and so far the one’s that I’ve been interested in either would require me to start out by taking a significant pay cut or I’ve seen tons of post saying it’s nearly impossible to get an entry level job (data science). At this point I’m just looking for some suggestions of careers that meet the following: 
1. Ability to work remotely
2. Ability to work mostly alone without having to do tons of presentations and talking (so no UX design)
3. Starts at &gt;$70

I am located in Texas, with a master’s degree. I would like to avoid getting another degree considering I’m still paying off a significant amount of student loans but I am willing to do a bootcamp or something similar. I am in my 30s. As far as desired work schedule, just the normal 9-5. Would prefer it not include much travel. 

TIA!"
1539,Are there more job titles that fit my skill set?,careerguidance,"Hello, I’m a dude in my early 30s in central North Carolina who has already gone though one career transition. I was a high school science teacher for six years(bachelors in science Ed) but got frustrated and took a data science bootcamp to build all this pertinent data skills in addition to things I already learned from my science background. 

The past two years I’ve worked a job where I primarily write SQL queries and use ETL software to convert customer data from their legacy databases to my company’s database, and do all the work to ensure the integrity of that data blah blah blah. I also work with python, version control, command line stuff etc.

To be specific with my skill set: I was a good high school science teacher for 6 years(my focus was physics, so strong math background), and all the things that go with that. I’d say I’m an “expert” at writing SQL, and good with working with both Python and R for data analytics, and have a medium sized portfolio of data work I did in my bootcamp. 

I’ve been applying for entry level data analyst jobs and data engineer jobs that seem like they fit my skill set, but are there any job titles I may be missing? My area isn’t exactly a hotbed of tech jobs, and my wife and I aren’t exactly in a position to relocate right now(to say, RTP where there’s way more jobs for this skill set). But I’m desperately trying to find something new so I can at least try to get some kind of work life balance back. Sorry for the long message, and any assistance would be appreciated."

1546,I have some unusual circumstances. Which of the following items should I include in my cover letter? (And what is the right way to go about phrasing?),careerguidance,"I’ve crossposted in several subreddits for visibility. Throwaway because I will be disclosing some personal information. 

Essentially, I am applying to jobs in the management consulting sector (larger firms like Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG) in a city that is a little over an hour away from where I currently live. The applications allow for a cover letter, and I think I should include one to explain my situation, but I am unsure of what details to include and how to include them. Below is a list of topics that I am thinking I might address:

* I will be officially CPA certified in either February or March of this year. My application is already with the state board and I am confident that it will be approved. 
* I moved to the city I currently live in before completing my degree to take care of my grandparents after one of them fell and had a pretty serious injury. I was only planning to be here for the recovery period, but they ended up being in worse condition than I originally expected so I settled in a little longer and got a job at a local CPA firm. I continued to work there for the past three years, receiving small promotions when I completed my undergrad degree (I was only missing a few credits and was able to finish those online) and when I sat for my CPA exams. For clarity: I officially obtained my undergraduate degree \~2 years ago but began working in my industry 3 years ago.
* I quit my job at the firm back in June of this year when it became clear that my grandparents needed more full-time hands on care (my grandfather has developed a very aggressive form of dementia; he is also diabetic and going blind). At that time, they were both steadfastly refusing to move into assisted living and would turn away home health care professionals we sent, so it was up to me. 
* When I quit, I had an offer to work at another firm remotely, but after my month-long probationary period I decided it wasn’t going to work for a variety of reasons and left that position as well. The owner was extremely unhappy. I have decided to leave this job completely off my resume. Since then, I have been unemployed (but busy and not actively looking). 
* At the end of last year, my parents and I were finally able to transition my grandparents into assisted living, which was a huge relief, and I am ready to rejoin the job market. Because I will not be tied to them as closely, I have started looking at positions in the next city over, which is much bigger and actually has opportunities in my field of interest (business strategy and analysis / management consulting). I currently live in my home city with my partner, but would happily commute (and even get my own apartment) in the bigger city if I were to get a job there.
* I have no social media presence whatsoever (not even an active linked in account) because of issues I’ve had with a stalker that I would prefer to not get into, but many of the applications request a linked in link and I don’t know how detrimental it is to not have one. 

Any advice regarding what should be included or how I could phrase this professionally would be deeply appreciated. I've read several articles covering generic cover letter composition but did not find them to be terribly helpful, but I'll check out any recommended articles as well. Thanks in advance."
1547,Is a bird in hand better than a bigger bird on the tree? I have an offer and it looks like a better company will make an offer soon,careerguidance,"Hello to everyone! I’m a Construction Project Manager with 6 years of industry experience. I’m not a US citizen and need a visa process to work here. 

Last year, due to personal reasons, I took time off work and returned to my home country. Now I’m ready to get back to my life.

I have an offer from a medium sized company which is providing an Okish salary and bare medical insurance. I interviewed with a bigger firm and they have much better benefits and salalries. It looks like they will give me an offer soon.

1. how should I hold off the first offer without offending them?

2. Can I ask the 2nd company to make an offer sooner as I already have an offer on hand?

I need the company to process the visa before I can live and work in the United States and not a lot of companies are willing to do it, so I feel like I have a lot to lose by risking it and not jumping on the first offer.

1548,How should I promote my work as a Designer?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone, I'm a Designer that never got his career to get off. After I've graduated, I've worked in other areas, but then I started to work at a small business that did branding, textile printing and vynil cutting. The problem is, I've always worked for next to minimum wage, and althought I'm a jack of all trades, I can't say I'm a master of anything and have a continuous imposter syndrome, no matter how much I learn, and believe me, I do try to learn alot.

From graphic design, to UI/UX, even CAD, I can do everything but I've found I'm awful at promoting myself, and can't get jobs if no one knows about me. I'm also a person that tries to avoid too much confrontation or contact with others, and that puts me often at odds with this aspect of my career.

Since I'm not getting any younger, does anyone have any advice of how to start promoting myself, how to go the extra mile and how do you keep focus if you can't find any?"
1549,Should I take this venture capital internship?,careerguidance,"I’m currently in my first year of undergraduate business studies with past internship experiences in MNCs where I was mostly involved in marketing (as it was my major in polytechnic). 

I’ve been very interested in venture capital and joined a venture capital club in my school as well as participated in a venture capital case competition. 

I don’t have a finance background but I’d say due to my passion and experiences working with founders and quite a bit of research within my club, I was offered a venture capital internship this summer! 

It’s a small firm where I live but I have little doubt that the founder who’s my hiring manager will devote time into teaching his interns like me. 

The pay is low (as mentioned by him) but with potential for a significant bonus (verified by other interns) - I don’t really care about pay at this juncture but wanted to provide this info for context.

Should I take it? I don’t think I’d be interested in taking another marketing internship for now as I don’t want to be too niche (even though I love marketing but I also want to explore VC!)

Does it matter that it’s a small firm that’s not well-known?"

Literally nothing to prove I work there, I don't even know my employee ID number. I have worked at other large institutions similar to this university and it has never been this way. I emailed the people in charge of my onboarding and they said they are waiting for my appointment of employment to be approved in their system. I'm not sure what that means because I've already started working. I am just concerned that this is not normal and I don't know how long this could take. The longer it takes, the longer I am without benefits which really seems unfair to me. Or maybe I'm overdramatizing the situation? Plus until this gets worked out I need to pay for visitor parking which is $14/day which is just absurd lol. My new boss seems to think nothing of it and seems comfortable to just wait to hear back from the onboarding staff, but they are very slow to respond to emails and I'm kind of stressing about it so I wanted to see what people think I should do.

1559,What is the most effective career path?,careerguidance,"My previous post kind of phrased it a bit off. A job's main purpose is to make money ( at least in my mind ) and I just want to know the most effective way of earning money. What I mean by this title is ""How do I move up in the income ladder AKA become rich in the fastest and most efficient way possible?""

The checklist for this job is

* To suffer early on and have an easy life later
* Remote / Work From Home
* Short Working Hours and TON OF MONEY
* Does not require some high-level education that requires a ton of money
* I'm not confident in scholarships cause luck does matter still.
* The job should have an introverted nature hence the work from home. ( interpersonal skill is being worked on :) )

Any comment is helpful and the job does not necessarily have to tick all the boxes. It is fine if the job even ticks one of the boxes off, the more boxes ticked off the better the job is suited for me.

The main idea that I have at this current moment is to go in the line of Coding / Programming. Since it can be done with a coding boot camp and a good portfolio and actual knowledge of the field instead of just finishing the boot camp just for the sake of it.

Also had an idea to be a content creator whether it be gaming or educational but honestly that is quite dependent on luck in my eyes and does not pay in a fixed income. Maybe in the later part of my life once I got a stable job and transitioning into content creation makes sense but for now, the answer is ""No"".

Jobs that are luck-based are not welcomed such as gambling or the stock market or being born into a rich family.

I am not lazy. I preface this by saying that I rather work myself to be bone now to have a nice life later on and rather have the most effective path to this goal. Work smart, not hard ! :)"
1560,What would you consider the best online programming education for someone to learn that will put them in a position to start earning money 1 year from now working remotely/freelance?,careerguidance,"I realize this is potentially a loaded question, and there are probably tons of variables here that I am not aware of, that programmers here with extensive educational and work backgrounds are aware of. So I apologize in advance for any arrogance in my presumptions.

With that understood, my question is basically the following: if you had to take a reasonably intelligent person off the street, and put them in a position to earn money 1 year from today in a remote-work/freelance role, what educational program(s) would you tell them to start taking? Preferably low-cost or as close to free as possible. I'm not trying to get rich here, just trying to find something where I can earn a side income from.

I realize one logical answer here might be ""go to a coding bootcamp"" but I would prefer to avoid the cost of a programming bootcamp if possible. I would be fine learning some obscure single language/task if I knew there were freelance jobs available specializing in that task.

About me: very limited programming experience, but I do have significant experience building vba/formula-driven excel-based financial models, so I'm sure some programming logic has been burned into my brain at this point.

How do you manage more clients at the same time? I would like to start handling other clients at the same time too, I see a lot of ""full time"" jobs that accept also contractor (freelancers) but I'm afraid that two clients/jobs that are ""full time"" (8h) could be too much work to handle.

1565,What should I do if I chose the wrong uni?,careerguidance,"Hi, I appreciate any help here &amp; sorry for the long text.

I was born &amp; raised in a developing country in Southeast Asia until I'm 16. I was known to be smart and I ended up being in top 3 in every class. My parents were trying to find out scholarship options in Singapore and an agency told them. I took the test and I got it. Turns out it was an 8 month diploma program and 2 years bachelor degree and the curriculum is trash. Sorry if its confusing, in a nut shell, I think my parents were too eager to send me abroad and fell for a scam about a scholarship for a private school, but turns out they teach nothing. I ended up with almost no friends too because there were only like 2 lessons/week, each 3 hours and the classmates are very individualistic, its hard for me to make friends with the Singaporeans. I also beat myself up for not researching about this private school, but I was 16 and I only wanted to please my parents, I thought they knew best, turns out they were wrong. Now I've been a software engineer (im 22 this year) since 19 years old but Im \*bad\* at my job because I barely learnt during my uni

On top of not learning much for 5 years, I developed CPTSD because of not being able to bond with anyone in SG and emotional neglect from my parents. I had depression before I went to SG, it just getting worse and worse. I love coding, but it hurts to think that I've failed pursuing a better education. Small things like a youtube ad about taking exam for top universities or my friends talking about their final year project triggers me about how my parents failed to make an informed decision of my future university. I didnt go through 2 years of senior high school and went through a crap uni. I just wish I was normal. I started work at 19 and its just not normal and now I barely have any friends. Im not like other young people

I dont know what should I do. Redo my bachelor? Take masters? Take a completely different field? I love coding and I know I can learn it by my own, but even studying triggers me a lot since it reminds me that I barely did any productive stuff during uni.

I just dont know if I should continue coding, it feels like I didnt learn it properly and now its not worth it to try &amp; complete my knowledge. I dont know what other career options are there and I also dont know if anyone will take me, I didnt complete senior high school. I consider cooking but it sounds like a downgrade. Im also very interested in combining my religion and psychology stuff like my emotional neglect and codependency tendencies but it sounds too painful for me now. I want to help others like me but it feels like its too hard to be a pastor because I have to keep my image and also be reminded 24 hour about my trauma since Im helping others related to my trauma

I know a lot of this stuff is only my negative thoughts and low self esteem, Im working on it on therapy, but I really wonder about my career, I felt that decision to go to SG when I was 16 really ruined my life and its really something I cant take back, making me suicidal. How can I know what other field I can take? Will any decent uni take me with my qualifications? Should I stop working and work on my therapy full time? Thanks"
1566,How do I decide my path?,careerguidance,"I'm 25 now and i'm unsure what my next steps are, a bit of a quarter-life crisis. 

I graduated with a business degree in 2018 and I'm only just starting to understand what I like about a role more a career more - currently I am a digital sports journalist though there's focus on SEO which I really dislike, though I write and have always enjoyed writing. I love sports, though the pressure of having to write about it is slightly swaying me away from it which I didn't anticipate where it now feels like a chore.

It's an office role - currently WFH - but I realise all these job fancy titles, competing for promotions, being in Zoom calls I truly don't care about and office politics just doesn't attract me at all, i'm always feeling like i'm missing out on whats out there, as I really am desperate to move abroad (currently live in UK)

After backpacking for five months in 2019, I came to a life dilemma. My dream would be somethng like going to different countries, writing about food or hostels and just really live a little, or  creating something which allows me to move around, just a job which allows me to be anywhere in the world but is something I actually enjoy! I've realised I need something I believe, that makes and impact or I feel as though I'm making a difference.

I'd also love to have something of my own in terms of a business - I've looked into e-com and Amazon stores/own brand but I just don't know where to start.

One thing I know having spoken to friends in grad roles, is that I feel like I don't want to get sucked into the hamster wheel, when I feel I should 'go against the grain' so to speak, and risk a little to see if I can live a dynamic and different career rather than five years passing by, and I just settled for the office job because it's what society tells you to do. I'm also worried about housing, with that pressure of buying a house and if I did end up going abroad, i'd have nothing left for me back home in terms of security (currently live at home)

Just feeling a little anxious about the future, would be great to hear some guidance and advice!"

Looking for some advice. I'm in college studying data, while also trying to complete a few certifications and building my portfolio project, to hopefully find a job in 5-6 months. 

I'm stuck in a inflexible and uninspiring Sales job in the meantime. Ideally I would have a part-time job or a flexible hours job which would allow me to focus more on college, completing certs and my project. Do you guys have any recommendations? Ideally, it would be a Monday - Friday job for 5-7 months. Any ideas?"

1573,First Job Job- Is it normal to feel constantly pushed around?,careerguidance,"Hi guys,

I got an office job in the construction industry- I'm 18M and have been at the job for a couple of months.

Is it normal that most of my colleagues constantly feel the need to tell me to do things that have nothing to do with my role? Or give me advice about how I should do things even when I'm right? I can say it's not me being difficult because everyday I have to talk to my manager for him to simply  relay what I said so they would listen.

I'm on good terms with my department, it's just other departments that do this. It's this constant uphill battle to feel equal to everyone who is pretty much on the same level as me.

I don't know if it's my attitude issue or my age that everyone looks down on?  Everyone at my job are older than me by at least 10 years and most except the managers are paid less (according to the job ads floating around). I've also noticed that everyone but the managers have been with the company for less than 2 years, with staff constantly moving jobs, within and outside the company.

My question is is it normal? I came into this role not knowing what to expect. I'm not sure if I'm just being sensitive but everyday is kinda annoying. I've been laying low so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I should add that I'm the only one in the company who is studying a construction related qualification- everyone else came from the retail sector."
1574,Career/general advice for a 17 year old?,careerguidance,"Hi there, i'm 17, however despite being so young i've kind of been having a hard time deciding on my future despite my options being pretty clear for me and i've kind of been having a 'mid-life crisis' type of thoughts recently (lmao). Honestly just looking for an older persons opinions on my questions I have. This is a long post so I appreciate anyone who is able to take time out of their day to help someone like me :D.

\- So for starters I love basketball and have been playing it since I was like 13. One of the two career paths I decided for myself was a professional basketball player. I have the height (6'4/193CM) and consider myself to be quite athletic and good at the game (top team at my school etc.). I'm not looking to be in the NBA or anything but I am considering playing in China. I believe I have good chances of succeeding with this pathway as i'm: 1) Quite literally built for the game, 2) My trainer previously played professionally in China (CBA). Again, Im not looking to become some kind of NBA caliber player as I'd be perfectly fine just being some bench player and pulling like 200k a year. However I worry that I'll only be able to play for a good 5-10 years before I decline athletically and retire. I understand the importance of being financially smart as a sports player so i'll be sure to invest my income and not go all out and end up broke after retiring (i've already begun investing in crypto etc.). Im sure that I'll be able to be financially secure for the rest of my life going this way. 

However, I feel that after retiring at about 30-35 (after my supposed athletic prime), i'll just have lot's of money and have nothing to do. Sure i'll want to have a family and travel the world and drive fancy cars and what not but I feel like after a couple of years of that i'll have nothing to do compared to if I was like a doctor or something.

\- Still though I feel like this is one of those things where if I don't do it, i'll look back and say like shit I should've done it and taken the risk. I think phrases like YOLO and do what you want in life as you only live once start to make more and more sense to me now as I guess if you only live once you might as well take a risk and strive to do what you want the most. Also the phrase live well not long or something really makes sense to me now as I feel going down this path I honestly wouldnt even be sad if I died at 50 if I got hella girls and drove fancy cars while I was alive. However that may just be the teenage side talking.

 1) So my first question really is: Is retiring that early with money really that glamorous? I feel that as a teen my view/perspective on this is that I'll just be bored etc. and take the ability of retiring early for granted.  However, I feel like from an adults perspective this would be a dream situation and anyone would trade their 9-5 job just to make ends meet for this opportunity. Honestly I just fear that after my basketball career is over i'll just have nothing to do and no contributions to make I guess. (To be clear I have no intentions of becoming a coach or a ref or anything else other than a player) 

&amp;#x200B;

\- As for my second option I could opt to study hard and become a doctor (physician) . I consider myself very academically smart. I consistently get the equivalent of A+ in America (In NZ it is called high excellence), in the 'Asian 5' (3 sciences, maths and english), and would say I  am in a position where I can confidently enter the university program for BioMED. Basically the idea is I study hard and become a physician or something then live rest of my life happy. 

However, I hate the idea that I will study for like a 1/4 of my life and become only become stable when im 30+. I feel like I'd miss most of my 'young' years and when I can finally say I made it and have nice stuff i'll be balding and start looking like shit as if I studied my prime away. I've read countless reddit posts about doctors regretting their career path and I really started getting cold feet about it. I understand the notion that you should only make something your career if you 100% love doing it, I am 99% sure this is the only other career option i'd consider other than becoming a ball player. I've genuinely looked at everything and nothing else appealed to me and I am like 99% sure this wont change. Also I know a bit immature and may be untrue, but I genuinely want to live life to it's fullest while i'm at my peak but idk if I can achieve that while studying as hard as you need to become a medical student. 

Despite the study thing, I like the idea of a doctor as in contrast to a basketball player, I feel that my whole life i'll have some sort of purpose to fulfil and something to do instead of like yeah dribble the basketball for 5-10 years... now what?. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I want to just mention that i'm sure that I have a lot of misconceptions about life and shit in general. I'm sorry this post had zero structure just sort of wanted to rant and ask for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My two big questions are: 

1) Is retiring that early with money really that glamorous? 

2) If you were in my position what would you do:

\-Again to repeat, imagine you have the god given traits of being tall, athletic and good at basketball and have a decent chance of making a basketball league which will likely net you like 500k minimum (found it on google) for the next 5-10 years. And then retire early. 

You also are very smart and if you work really hard you can likely get into med school and whatnot and become a doctor. However school is long and tedious in the path to becoming one. 

So if you were in my shoes would you choose a) professional basketball player or b) medical doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

(Also I want to include that I understand that succeeding in both these professions are easier said than done and require lots of hard work to succeed and 'make it' in these professions. I just want an opinion on which one to work towards :D)

Thank u for reading! Appreciate any advice!!!"
1575,How can I change my mindset / attitude towards building new relationships ? I'm dreading it.,careerguidance," 

Tldr: Trying to find type networking that fits my personality despite hating building new relationships.

I'm 34 y/o male.

Don't consider this to be a rant. It is a serious topic. My partner is frustrated with me because despite having lived in London for 9 years now I literally have no network and no friends and I'm OK with it.I have no desire to build new relationships and that is a big problem since we're living in the world pretty much depending on how well we connect with others. In fact one's success is pretty much determined by how well he / she can network. But what a person supposed to do if he / she doesn't value relationships ? I'm not an introvert. Introverts are usually shy and timid. My partner said I'm confident and independent. I just don't go out of my way to make friends or trying hard for people to like me.

I'm into IT and programming. My latest project was web app and mobile app that used facial recognition and other technologies to help women avoid abusive men while using dating apps.

My project (that I have put on hold) helps tackle child sex slavery using technology. Exciting project if you ask me.

My problem is my complicated personality my partner would say. I want to help people without needing people. I've pushed people off my life and I'm really good at it. My phonebook contains only my partner and her family. My family lives in another country. Last night my partner said ""Imagine we're getting married and who's gonna show up on the wedding from your side ? Who will be your best man and witnesses ? How many people will show up ? I'll have my friends and family but I'm really worried about you ..."".

She doesn't like the fact that I'm completely comfortable being a loner. She says it's crippling my professional growth and I think she's right. People who have just graduated get better jobs than me simply because they're social and they network. I just don't understand why I need other people to be successful in life ? Who came up with this ? My project failed mostly because I have no credibility, nobody knows me, really and the bad part apparently is that I'm OK with it. Social validation is everything though.

I've joined some networking events on meetup.com but I'm gonna be dreading it.

I suspect the only way I will enjoy networking with other people is when I discover the type of networking I'll enjoy."

1578,How to maintain mentors/network in industry?,careerguidance,"I'm having difficulty establishing relationships in my industry that I believe may be hindering career growth/opportunities. I've been working as an engineer in industry &lt;4 years for small companies, and unfortunately most of my coworkers in my teams haven't been the most ambitious types that have desires to grow (they just show up for the paycheck). While I know it's not good to be picky regarding colleagues, I've read from career guides that it is ideal to find ""superstars"" to form connections with, so that as you both grow in your careers you can help each other secure the best opportunities.  

To compensate, I've spent some time over the past 2 years messaging and scheduling informational interviews with people in my industry (biomedical/biotech) through LinkedIn/college alumni network. I've met a number of fascinating individuals, and I try to catch up with a few every 6 months to maintain the contact. However, I feel like these relationships are very one-side on my part where I'm putting in the bulk of the effort, which is making me question whether I'm doing the whole networking thing correctly.

Finally, even after speaking to multiple individuals in my industry, I don't really know anyone who I can ask to mentor me in my career. As I've worked for only small companies, most of my colleagues are also young and the more experienced ones are the ""just collecting a paycheck"" types that I'm not sure would make for good mentors. Some of my friends in other industries have said that their mentors have helped them greatly in making career decisions, so I feel I may be missing out on a lot by not having a mentor. 

To sum up, I feel like I've put in a lot of effort in networking but am not gaining a meaningful network. How have other members of this sub spent their time to grow and maintain their professional network?"
1579,Next career move? Open to suggestions please!,careerguidance,"Hi there,

I'm a bit stuck on making a move or staying where I am. Currently my role is technical sales, so it's very 'on the ground' and key-account/new business oriented. I've had good success in the 7 years with the company, but I don't see any internal growth opportunities and I feel I've learnt a good amount about sales. However the salary and commission is good for where I live.

What would be a logical step from here? I'm not sure what role I would fit in with my experience, as it does not involve much management at ( I've been in the industry for about 12 years, with previous roles being R&amp;D and technical as well.)   Advice would be appreciated."

1583,"Trying to reconcile two parts of me, careerwise. Care to weigh in?",careerguidance,"Sometimes I feel like I have two completely opposite parts of me, that are equally big and are hard to combine. And I was wondering if people recognise it.

On the one hand I am someone who needs a lot of free and personal time. I have called myself ""a forest hag"", as I need a lot of peace and quiet. Focus on my husband and animals.. And do not want to be bothered.. 

On the other hand I am super ambitious, am good at my job and climb the corporate ladder very fast. I need the mental stimulation of a job I find interesting and that I am invested in.

Maybe it's important to mention that I have diagnosed autism. Throughout my life I have learned a lot, so social interactions aren't necessarily hard anymore.. But since it's 90% masking, they are very draining. This isn't to say I don't enjoy them, they just cost me a lot of energy. 

My first job out of uni (did it for 4 years) was a job that appealed to part number two. I worked my ass off. It was very gratifying. But it also broke me down as a person. I had constant jawpain from clenching my teeth, I barely slept more than 4 hours a night. Had very little time for friends and social time.. But I still loved those years. I did really cool things. Had great coworkers and wouldn't change te experience for anything in the world. 

Now I have a job very well suited for the first aspect. I work, at most, 1 hour a day. Fully remote. Great pay and benefits.. Have all the time in the world for my husband, family and friends. But I am so, so, so bored.. My boss is the most incompetent person I have ever encountered in a professional setting. I feel myself growing so demotivated and my skills are going backwards. I take courses in my free time, but its not enough and not the same as learning in a professional context.

I have applied for another job that on the outset seemed to be an 'in between'. Fully remote, but much more engaged. 

That company offered me a fantastic opportunity to take the lead of their entire tech branch. Which is near insane to be asked for this early in my career. And an amazing opportunity.  It's going to be flexible hybrid working. The pay ofcourse is staggering.. benefits are great. 

But I also know... This is going to really stressful.. its going to take a lot of me, mentally but also in terms of hours worked a week. And there is going to be very little room for the 'forest hag' part of me. The ambitious part of me really doesn't want to say no. And I am really looking forward to the challenge. 

My husband is very supportive, but he is also scared to 'loose me to my job again'. Which is a very reasonable concern if my first job is any indication. 

Anyone recognise this? Anyone cares to weigh in?"

1587,"I'm being under paid, how do I respond?",careerguidance,"My older sister told me that her friend is looking for someone to help his small property management company and wanted to hook me up with this opportunity. Initially, my sister told me what her friend told her around $1,000 to $2,000 a month, helping with computers and doing small paper work etc. Hours were super flexible and pay was all cash under the table. Me, being a student and all, that sounded like an awesome opportunity. My sister gave me his number and I called him that same day. We talked for hours about what he needed and some other details. He never told me how much he'd pay me and I never asked because we planned on meeting in person soon to talk more in depth about the details. This was all in early December.

""Boss"" guy sent me a text a day or two later saying he couldn't meet with me until Early January cause he needs to wrap some things up. Totally understandable, had no issues with that. Fast forward to yesterday. I finally got to meet up with him. He called me asking if I could help reinstall Windows 10 on two of the computers there and he'd pay me $80. I thought pay was reasonable because it's a pretty easy task, nothing over 3 hours and this is the chance to talk further details about me working part-time there.

I show up and everything was normal at first. But the first weird and kind of 'red flag' was when he said he could pay me the $80 or give me this used 48inch TV. I chose the TV because I knew I could sell it for over $80 (looking back, I regret not choosing the $80). I was there for over 5 hours because he wanted to get fresh air like 15 times an hour and would take me with him. I could of done the job in under 3 hours but he wouldn't really let me use the computer... to fix the computer. He wanted me to tell him what to do while he does it. Not really a problem, just made the job much slower than it needed to be. During our conversations, I would ask a lot of questions like ""So when can I expect to start part-time?"" and he told me probably in February. He never really elaborated on his answers. He told me he's still convincing his boss to hire me and kind of just left it at that. I started to realize this was a waste of time.

Towards the end of the shift, one of the PC's hard drives died. The hardware was so old it's done. When I got home he immediately called me and I could tell he was kind of upset cause during that 5 hours only one of the computer was done. I told him that he could buy a new hard drive and I could come and replace it. He agreed. We were face calling because he was showing me the PC. I was on my home computer and I was showing him the Amazon listings of hard drives and then he asked if I could order it. I responded, ""What??"" He said he could reimburse me and how he doesn't have a prime membership so I did. As we were scheduling for when I could come in I just said ""so the total was $55.04..."". Boss said ""Okay, I could give you $50"".

So, I'll be paying you to come work for you? Is what I thought in my head. He said in a nicely manner something along the lines ""Oh, since you started this you gotta finish it right? ha ha"" Pretty much blaming me for it.

After he told me $50 he immediately changed it to $60 probably after he realized that he's paying me for less than what I ordered. He told me to bring $40 cash because he only has a $100 bill.

I don't want to do this anymore because I'm not okay with working for four dollars and 94 cents. I'm busy enough with my classes and rather work a real part-time job that actually pays. I remembered during the shift he told me I could expect a call from him in February but he needs me desperately now. What do I tell him and how do I tell him? I'm not a very confrontational person but when it gets to a point, I can/will be. I don't want to be aggressive but I need some guidance on how to address this. Sorry for the long post and if you read this far, I appreciate it!

1588,Why don’t I hear back from my applications after I’ve added relevant experience?,careerguidance,I am a Student attending university of Calgary in Canada looking for some advice entering my final year of business analytics.

It was unpaid but I felt like it was worth it to just have my first bit of relevant experience on my resume and I did end up learning a lot. They offered to extend me but unfortunately could not afford to pay me so I did not extend with them as I could not afford to dedicate that much time with no compensation any longer along with that I could not afford to delay my graduation any further for an unpaid internship. It’s been about 2 months since I started applying for other paid internships and I’ve been applying to around 10-15 positions a week all over the country trying to land one more with a company I could work alongside from now till I graduate in fall 2022 and possibly even past that but I haven’t even been getting any responses to my applications just straight up rejections no interviews or anything.

Hi fellow redditors,

So this is my dilemma, I left my old job for a smaller company about 5 months ago after working with my previous employer for three years for a higher salary and because of burn out working 12 hours every day.

The new company I'm at now doesn't have any processes in place, is used to firefighting instead of planning and none of my senior colleagues, team leads seem too interested in managing/planning, any questions I ask end up with me being passed around from one team member to another.

I am not enjoying this new position and dread going to work every day, I'm not sure what to do now

* Should I suck it up for a year before moving on as I have been led to believe anything less than a year on a CV is a red flag, if I can last that long I think the experience just might be valuable.
* Try and get back to my old employer as I didn't burn any bridges and left on good terms.
* Start looking for new jobs but I'm not sure how to explain why I'm looking to leave just after a few months.

I am a software engineer in the uK, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Went to a smaller software implementation company next - was a business analyst mostly data analysis and UAT for a specific software tool. 75k when I started, left after 3 years at 87k. 

I’m currently at a mortgage company (3 years in), in a role that I feel has been backtracking my personal development for quantitative work, as it is mostly process documentation and metrics reporting. The hours are great and currently making around 100k, just have no desire to stay in the team so I’ve been applying around internally. 

I’m also a year into my MBA which is at least helping my development

I like the financial management possibilities at my company, but admittedly don’t have a “dream job” in mind. Something generally quantitative and interesting in nature would be great.  

Any thoughts on alternatives or should I keep looking internally and network while I can in my current job?

I understand my current role is not HR related but I have gained a lot of skills from my current position that would help me in the future for a HR position. After college I want to be a recruiter so I need to make my career change now and start gaining experience. Most HR assistant positions require or prefer a BS degree, in which I am still working on. Anyone have any recommendations on what I could do to be noticed? Or ways I could gain experience and still be financially stable?"

I’ve worked a bunch of crappy gym jobs and have even dabbled in the entrepreneur route but have not been able to make enough money to support myself and my family. My only real experience is personal training so I feel my skills are limited and won’t transfer over to any other field. Not to sound like an arrogant prick, but I am a very intelligent individual and I feel I can troubleshoot just about anything, but all I really have is my word as proof. What are some feasible options that I can look into pursuing?

P.S. I am passionate about fitness, but I figured I’d do it in my spare time since it’s not making me any money."

1608,I currently work evenings but want to ask my boss if I can ALSO work day shift (2 jobs same company). Should I? Advise is welcomed,careerguidance,So I work from home 1pm-9pm and make about 80k. I heard in the news that lots of people who work from home are secretly working 2 jobs and bringing home double salary. Without their 2 employers knowing about each other. I want to give this a try. I would only ask my boss for part time so he don’t think I’m overlapping. Maybe 9am - 1pm. My company is huge so there’s definitely a need. This would bring my salary to around 120k.   Would that make me look bad?  I’m assuming there’s likely a company policy against this? OrShould I instead try to get a second remote job with a different company?   Currently I have a lot of downtime in my position.
1609,What's good non-tech industry career to pivot away from Software Engineering? [33M],careerguidance,"I've been job hunting for nearly a year now and I just can't take the Leetcode-style interviews anymore. I have a very successful 8-year career in Software Engineering and because I'm too slow at merging two binary trees no company will touch me with a 10' pole. I enjoy the technical aspects of my career such as optimizing for performance and scale, so I would like to stay in a technical field, but one preferably that hires based on portfolio and experience versus academic quibbling.

My dream would be to become a Meteorologist, but the career prospects don't seem too great. Mechanical and Electrical engineering seem interesting on paper, but I have no idea if their interviewing processes are as asinine as Software Engineering. Regardless, I'm probably looking at going to school. (I didn't go to college in the first place, so no sunk cost there). Librarian seems like a tranquil position, but perhaps too good to be true.

Anybody have any potential career suggestions?"

1613,"Reddit, what sort of jobs do I have a shot at with my [25F] experience?",careerguidance,"I’m currently in customer support for a tech company, and I’ve realized the past month that I am done with customer service. It feels demeaning and I need to move to something different for the sake of my mental health. I feel like I’m smart enough to handle a lot of things, I just don’t know what roles to be searching for that I would be considered for, or what other sort of affordable steps I could be taking now to make me hirable for other types of roles.

To summarize my background:

-Have a BS degree in English Education - Secondary. Due to state licensure requirements I can only teach high schoolers with this type of degree, and I have no interest in it after being sexually harrassed by students during my student teaching. I cannot get licensed for elementary with this degree here, and the pay (or lack of) does not make going back to school financially worth it. With covid, I’ve seen nothing but miserable teachers. Just wanted to mention my degree without automatically being suggested to go to teaching.

-I have worked in tech customer support for over a year. I worked at a restaurant bartending/ supervising while I was unsure what to do after college. Worked an admin job at a doctor’s office. Did student teaching for high school. Taught English to kids online part-time. Sell painting commissions part time, though very scattered. 

I’m very well liked at work because I know my way around the software and I go out of my way to help coworkers. Excellent communicator, great at explaining things. Genuinely a fast learner. Just lost and tired of dealing with customers. Also the micromanaging. I feel I deserve to at least be somewhat content with what I do 40 hours of my life every week. 

In a perfect world I’m a musician, concert photographer, author/illustrator, film director, or fine artist. I work on those things in my free time. But I have to pay bills and it would be cool to find something that I would be happy or at least okay with if my dreams don’t work.

Based on all of this, any suggestions on roles I might enjoy that I could be hired for now, or anything affordable I could be doing now to make myself hirable for those jobs?"

1615,When do I talk to my boss?,careerguidance," QUESTION:

**So, my question is, when is the right time to mention something to my boss? I've heard that the common wisdom is to wait until you have a firm offer from the ""other"" company before saying anything to your manager, does that apply here?**

DETAILS:

I've been with my current employer for 15 years. I work in Aerospace Engineering. I have an interview with a competitor setup for tomorrow. I have an interview setup for a new internal opportunity for Friday. My current manager is the formal hiring manager for the new position I'm applying for at work (somewhat complicated situation).

When do I tell my current manager that I'm looking for at an outside opportunity?

The new job has the following pluses:

1. I get to work on a cool new project.
2. I'm guessing it pays more, but no formal offer yet.
3. It is a guaranteed work from home opportunity.

At my current job, I have been pursuing and interviewed for several lateral transfers over the last six months. None have worked out. My manager has told me he thinks I'll be a better fit for this one coming up (I tend to believe him, but that doesn't mean this position is guaranteed). I want to move because I have been doing essentially the same job for 15 years, and I'd like to do something new, plus there is a toxic individual I want to get away from.

If my current employer offers me the new lateral position I'm interviewing for, I'm guessing it will mean the following:

1. I get to work on a new project, but it's not as cool as the ""other"" company.
2. Pay is not terribly likely to improve unless I can leverage a raise from the offer I get at the other company.
3. My current employer will want me to return to work part time as Covid winds down. I may be able to leverage a formal work from home agreement based on the offer I get from the new company.
4. I've been with this employer for 15 years. I know everybody. I am well respected by my peers and our leadership team. It is much *easier* to stay.

**So, my question is, when is the right time to mention something to my boss? I've heard that the common wisdom is to wait until you have a firm offer from the ""other"" company before saying anything to your manager, does that apply here?**"
1616,How do I get the most out of meeting with a cabinet minister? (UK),careerguidance,"It’s my first time posting, so I’ll keep it quite short. I come from a relatively humble background - single parent household with an annual income of ~£10k and schooled at the local state comp. I did quite well in school and managed to make it to Oxford and climb up the ranks within the Oxford Union to a senior position. At a an event, I had a chat with one of the guest speakers (the cabinet minister) who ended up inviting me to the Houses of Parliament for further discussion about careers/politics (or anything I wanted really) over lunch. However, although I’m excited, I’m not sure how I should go about it and I’m starting to stress like it is an interview (which it isn’t looool). They have had a remarkably successful career in law before making it to the top of politics and these are both areas of interest for me.

1617,"I'm confused, What should I study?",careerguidance,"Hello users of the internet 

Firstly I would like to say thank you for taking time out to read and maybe reply to this post. 

So to my point
I am a super confused 20 year old college graduate that's is in a weird place, i migrated to Canada with my family and went to college I did a CNC machinist diploma in 2 years and graduated with honnors. 

The next few months I looked for a job and honestly couldn't  find much even tho everyone told me the trade is in demand. After looking and even attending a few interviews I found my self abit let down so I decided to get a entry level job that some would say I'm over qualified for and im only 3 months in doing really basic work(machine operator). 

If I'm being honest I dont enjoy it and unless i get into a nice company i dont see me getting a 75k to 150k CAD salary. After tax😅 

I do like custom work however manufacturing is almost never one offs. 

So brings me to my current situation 

I'm thinking of a career switch or a career mrege let me explain. Firstly the merge I looked into system integration and robotics engineering I never thought I would even look in that direction however it's a very fast growing felid and I see money and alot of room to grow. 

To continue, I personally believe one doesn't need a computer science degree to learn coding however it's a step in the right direction and I'm sure  computer science degrees are getting over saturated but I'm thinking of learning a much niche felid revolving around AI/ machine learning but nothing is set and stone and let's say I randomly fall in love with software development I'm willing to learn to. 

The next two are strictly ideas and I'm not sure about data science and networking. 

When looking for something to study I'm looking for a few things. 

Career progression(I want to learn new things consistently and dont mind long work hours or a lot of head scratching) 

Money(I dont want to live pay check to pay check but still want to live a good life and I do plan on taking care of my parents when they get older and keep a emergency fund for them. So I care abt money) 

So now my question to you wise users of the world wide web. 

What would you do in my position and if you have any experience in the felids of study a chat would be happy to clear a few doubts. 

I thank you so much if you read all of this,I needed to get this off my mind and writing helps. 

I'm done living on the fence and want to take action be it an online course or just apply to university after I get the money."

1622,What are my next steps to get started as a business analyst?,careerguidance,"Hello everyone,

I  would like to get into the field of business analytics but would  greatly appreciate any help/advice on how realistic this is with my  background and what skills I need to make it happen.

First a bit of background information...

I  recently graduated with a master in Management Information Systems  (MIS) and have a bachelor in Business Administration in which I also put a focus towards MIS. Unfortunately I have no relevant experience to the  MIS field (which I know is bad and I really regret that) and my degree  was mostly focused on the business side of things. This means that while  I had introductory classes to python, databases (basic SQL queries) and  introductions to e.g. use case models, my technical knowledge does seem to be below the level it needs to be for even entry level positions. I have also moved countries since graduation (to Canada due to personal reasons) so it is not  possible for me to make use of my universities career center or alumni network in my home country.

Currently I am trying to  refresh my knowledge on SQL and am doing the google data analytics  certifcate. I have read that the certificate is not the best but I dont know where elese to start and was hoping that if I manage to finish the entire program including the capstone project at the end, that it would  at least somewhat improve my resume.

I  would like to know what knowledge I need to aquire, which skills I should focus on (SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau or PowerBI) and what  positions generally I should look for. I noticed that a lot of business  analytics positions require 2+ years of experience, so is there a step  before? And if yes, what would the title of those positions be? Are there other job titles that I should look for that are similar and more fitting for entry level?

Any help  is really appreciated. I know my situation isn't the greatest. I do  really regret not gathering real world experience in the IS/MIS field  earlier but I am willing to put in effort to better myself to find a  job!

Thank you!"
1623,Are there trade jobs that usually work a typical work week?,careerguidance,I know most trade job hours are dependant on the company but I guess what I'm asking is there any that are more likely to have a set schedule with weekends off than others.

1624,"Suggestions on how to bring up a promotion or salary bump in ""end of year"" review?",careerguidance,"**Chicago, IL:** Since taking on my current role as an entry-level analyst in February 2020, I've gone consistently above and beyond in terms of what my job expectations are for an entry-level position. I often finding myself doing extra side-projects, resolving issues with other departments, being referred to as a SME, and even representing my department in various high-profile meetings. My leadership is aware of the extra effort I put in as well as other managers and colleagues in higher positions through-out the company.

My end of year review is coming up and I want to bring up the possibility of being promoted to a senior position (there is no intermediate position between entry and senior) since I've put in all this work and have stuck around for almost two years. I did have this discussion with my manager back in October, but they informed me that my director prefers to promote people around three years. My former director (my team had a massive reshuffling during COVID) is one of the aforementioned individuals who recognizes the work I put in and even hinted that if my leadership does support and value me, they would go against office politics and fight for a promotion. Additionally, he agrees with me that my current workload is on-par (if not exceeds) that of a senior analyst and I definitely have grounds to be promoted. During the Pandemic I was awarded a pay raise (the range was 0-3% and I got the higher end of it but I'm sure these numbers can be higher for a normal period) and was mentioned that not everyone on my team got a raise.

After talking with my coworker who's in the same spot as me (we both do the exact same thing and joined at the same time), he's very much against the idea of bringing up the question during his review even though he shares the same sentiment as me. He notes that it could come off as me expecting a promotion (which is 100% valid) and could leave my manager in an uncomfortable place. I also talked someone who just joined our company recently and he mentioned in his previous roles, he had a close-working relationship with his managers and was able to ask/get the conversation started with no hassle. I'd like to go with the latter since I actually do have a close relationship with my manager and I think they're very understanding and receptive to feedback.

Any thoughts on how to approach asking for a promotion or salary bump? Thanks :)

1626,"Work from home, or take a position change and raise?",careerguidance,"I have worked in my current position for a few years, remote as a developer making ~$100k base now leading the team as of last year - I have been at this company several more. I've been told I get 10% annual raises based on performance (has been the case in past, no reason to doubt it) in addition to profit sharing and a 10% bonus.

I was recently approached by an old manager who put in notice of resignation, and he is requesting I apply for his position with his reference - and I suppose the backing of others. The pay I assume to be ~$160k base, but it would no longer be on the technical side of the fence - instead managing an infrastructure facility I helped build a long time ago.

I've been seriously burned out lately wanting change - and have dually been seriously mulling this over, and wanted advice from the best/worst place of all - Reddit.

Pros:
- Much increased pay
- Something different
- More social aspect, with COVID + remote work it gets a bit lonely

Cons:
- Driving to work daily 65 miles / 2hr
- Pets at home (2 cats and 3 dogs that spend the day with me)
- Working off my sofa with my own coffee, wearing pajama pants and dress shirts
- Politics of leaving one team you lead to work with another - even if I applied and didn't get it, I know some part of my management stack would know, and I know that there would be a void where I was

I'm worried if I take this too, I won't get the opportunity to work from home like this again - I don't have a degree and truth be told, am not sure how I ended up where I am.

Any input here is appreciated, I don't have long to make up my mind."

I also got accepted admission into a local neuroscience/cogsci program as well as an online human systems engineering program.

1632,Should I feel guilty about pursuing a series of interviews with a job in a different city when I have a job that I love and have only been at for a year?,careerguidance,"About a year ago, I (25M) got told about a job that was a great fit for me personally &amp; professionally, and it came about the same time that my previous job was restructuring and I didn't love some of the new tasks under my umbrella.

Fast forward a year, and I've been in the new job for a year and I love it. It's a great job, good pay, great benefits, a *very* casual &amp; chill environment, and while I have a boss, he trusts me implicitly to do my job so there's no day-to-day micromanagement. In short, it's a great place to be. Is it pushing me professionally? Definitely not, and it's a well-established university department so the job is 90% maintaining the status quo. I grew up in the city I'm currently in, but I don't have a tribe of people here and I have been single since my ex &amp; I broke up at the end of 2019. And for lack of a better term, there's pee in the dating pool here. I will say, one big factor that I was excited for was the ability to make new friends at work, but I've found it hard to make friends because nobody is really in the same part of life as me (they're all older, married, with children. Many are venturing closer to retirement). 

I've recently been contacted about a job in a different city several states away, a city that I do happen to love and where I do have friends already. From a facts standpoint, the new job would see me having about a 35% raise, the opportunity for relocation assistance, and better benefits than I currently have. The job itself would be very similar to the job I'm doing now but at very well established university, but in a brand new department so I would be flexing my muscle by building from the ground up. After talking to some friends and family, I decided to at least throw my name in the hat.

I've already done the first round interview and it went really well. I really enjoyed my conversation with the team up there, and I have a second &amp; third round scheduled. If I make it through those rounds, I will go up to the campus to visit.

In the past few days, I have started to feel VERY guilty about even entertaining this opportunity because I have a job &amp; boss that I love, it pays me well, and I'm comfortable professionally. I don't want to abandon my current place because they're great people and I have fit in to the group well, and they make me feel appreciated.

My pros &amp; cons are as follows: 

|CURRENT|NEW|
|:-|:-|
|**Pros**: known environment, very comfortable, GREAT boss, close to home, I'm very good at the job, VERY hard to get fired/let go from my current place of employment|**Pros**: new city and reset on personal life, big pay raise, closer to friends, flex my muscle, very established (read: much better) university than I currently work at with HUGE endowment|
|**Cons**: doesn't push me professionally, don't love the city I'm in on a personal level, coworkers are not my age/vibe, leaving would be hard after only a year|**Cons**: THE UNKNOWN, new boss seems cool from an interview but who knows, moving 1,000 miles, unknown about work environment |

Any advice about this would be appreciated. Anyone think I should just back out of everything and tell the new university I'm out? Should I keep going? If I do, how should I handle it with my current university? Thanks in advance, y'all."

After a long time of being harassed by customers, dealing with shitty middle managers and mediocre pay, I'm tired of being a reservationist, a customer service representative, a guest liaison, whatever you want to call it, I'm DONE.

The problem is that I was pretty aimless in college and my work experience is not great. I have a BA in psychology from a pretty good public university, but after graduating I realized that I'm not suited to research and I don't have the financial means or temperament to pursue a master's in clinical work etc. I wasn't involved in any extracurriculars that might've made me appealing because I was working 24 hrs a week and commuting on top of being a full time student.

I've always done well at my jobs and have a good reputation as a reliable guy wherever I'm employed, but most employers aren't interested in my limited experience. There are only so many ways to rephrase ""good on the phone"" on your resume. I'd like to work in the publishing industry as my ""real"" job and I run a film blog, so I'd like to transition to being a film critic/content creator as a side hustle. I'm based in a major city, so geographical proximity to publishing isn't an issue.

1639,What is the most effective job?,careerguidance,"My previous post kind of phrased it a bit off. What I mean by this title is ""How do I move up in the income ladder AKA become rich in the fastest and most efficient way possible?"" 

The checklist for this job is 

* To suffer early on and have an easy life later
* Remote / Work From Home
* Short Working Hours and TON OF MONEY
* Does not require some high-level education that requires a ton of money
* I'm not confident in scholarships cause luck does matter still.
* The job should have an introverted nature hence the work from home. ( interpersonal skill is being worked on :) )

Any comment is helpful and the job does not necessarily have to tick all the boxes. It is fine if the job even ticks one of the boxes off, the more boxes ticked off the better the job is suited for me.

The main idea that I have at this current moment is to go in the line of Coding / Programming. Since it can be done with a coding boot camp and a good portfolio and actual knowledge of the field instead of just finishing the boot camp just for the sake of it.

Jobs that are luck-based are not welcomed such as gambling or the stock market or being born into a rich family.

1640,What should I do?,careerguidance,"Hello everyone. Dropping by to seek some guidance.

My background: working as a digital lead for a huge firm, earning fairly decent money. Been doing this for 3.5 years. Married but have no kids. We both have no debt and huge obligations, we rent out an apartment, and have pretty stable jobs at that. USD45-46k combined net income per annum. Mine’s roughly 60% of that. My Income is peaking within the company, but I do reckon I have no other skills to prove my worth outside of it.

My problem:
I’ve been experiencing probably one of the darkest moments in my life for roughly the same time I have been working for this company. The workload is immense and I am given no support. I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I am working out a schedule with a therapist that was referred to me to try and make sense of things; My wife told me in tears that she wants me to be okay and to be “present” at home. I guess it’s already impacting our marriage. I want to quit my job already but I know the most practical thing to do is to secure a replacement job first before doing so— which I am currently doing. I am applying aggressively and have secured 2 interviews.

If I quit now, I should at least be able to survive and pay for my and my wife’s bills for 6 months with no income. If I secure a job right after I quit my current job, that would be better. But the current landscape is that I am sure that nobody would really pay me as much as my current employer. I’m looking at shrinking our net annual earning by half— around USD26-27k, but this would mean I would be more present and regain my life and be a better husband.

I am planning to work part-time and full time just to make up for what would eventually be lost from our net earnings annually so my question is, is quitting immediately the right thing to do, given my circumstance?

Appreciate the help— help that I desperately need. Be well, everyone."

I tried learning programming twice because it's supposed to pay well, but I couldn't get past even the basics of it and gave up both times.

I am married and have a 3 bed house with a mortgage, and I feel like I'm just going to be stuck in my current job for the rest of my life, earning a barely decent wage one day, and then retiring when I've fucked up my body from the work and living off a state pension until I die.

I want to earn more money. I'd like to work from home, so I was planning on trying to learn programming again, and going for python. But beyond that, I don't know what to do. 

I want to earn about £35k+, but I'm currently earning only £16k per year after taxes, which is ridiculous, as shop workers are earning more than that now on full time. My pay will go up again in April, but I doubt it'll go up any significant amount and I just want to find something that pays well, that isn't soul crushing or so draining I can't find energy to do anything else after.

1648,How do I structure conversation about my new role during reorg?,careerguidance,"Hi Reddit! I am not feeling good about where I ended up in a recent reorg and would love some advice on how to advocate for myself so that I get the position I feel deserve. I have been at this company for a year and since joining, have been an enormous team player, taking on projects that were beyond my job description, pivoting quickly to address business needs and often working late to put out fires.

We recently had a new CMO start who reorganized the team. I used to take on strategic projects that had a big impact on the business. However, with this new structure, I am now essentially a project manager. In addition, they placed a very recent hire as a team lead vs rewarding me as someone who has been loyal to the company and a hard worker. I am now reporting into someone that has no experience doing what I do and is junior to me based on experience. It feels like a huge demotion even though my former manager has called me the strongest performer and others on the team told me similar things.

I have a call with this new manager tomorrow and here is how I am thinking of structuring the conversation:

* Express congratulations on the promotion and excitement about working together
* Ask for an explanation of the new team I am now part of and my role and responsibilities (make sure I am understanding correctly that what I am being asked to do is much more executional rather than strategic in nature)
* Express that I am a team player and prioritize business needs; however, I also have a career and I would like us to discuss my needs
* List my projects and achievements and express that I'd like to continue having a strategic role on the marketing team rather than a project management one -&gt; I would like to lead a team and take on strategic problems rather than executional asks
* Ask why someone who was just hired was given people management responsibilities and my strategic responsibility - this is a sign the company has not valued my contributions, am I correct in that?

Any advice is so appreciated &lt;3"

1651,Can I get help with a Lowball Offer?,careerguidance,"Hey Reddit!

I’ve been working for a video company for 6 month, and need help with a recent disappointing low ball salary offer.

I started as a freelancer and got contracted for 2 months after a week of working with them. I was offered £20k for 3 days of work a week. Once the two months were over, my contract was rolled out for another 4 months, but this time earning £20k for 4 days work a week. I accepted in the hopes it would lead to a permanent role. I did mention to the manager once that I thought the value was low, but was ignored. They asked me if I’d like to join the company full-time and I happily said yes. However, I asked them to propose a permanent role description as well as a salary. I was told they were restructuring the company and I’d be discussing it before pay day (which is on the 26th way into the month). I worked for the first week without knowing my salary and after this told them I was uncomfortable working without knowing my pay, they understood and proposed a value. Since I’d been working for them I was expecting a minimum of £25k which matched my pro-rata salary, and once I was doing tasks above my pay-grade and had spoken with them about increasing my responsibilities (and they expressed only happiness with my work) I actually expected a raise to match my salary to the role I was fulfilling. However I was met with a disappointing proposal of £24k which is actually a salary demotion.

What should I do?

P.S: Thanks for the long read :)"

I will finish the masters in 2 years probably.

I like the idea of being a police officer although I'm not sure that it's challenging enough for me. I applied before when I wasn't studying but I didn't get in then  I need to be challenged by something and have some career perspective, that's why I went back to university next to my not so demanding job. I think I would really like the day to day work as s police officer, but I'm not sure about the career perspective in the long run.

1666,How to Explain Gap In Resume?,careerguidance,"Hi All,

I'm not quite sure how to structure my linkedin/resume and thought I would ask the community for advice.

2006-2010: Undergrad

2010-2013: Masters Degree (Didn't finish)

2013-2015: Masters Degree (part time) - Still didn't finish :(

2015-2022: Full Time job

I completed my undergrad in 2010 with honours. I pursued a Masters degree, but it didn't work out. I was a full time Masters student from 2010-2013 and converted to a part time masters student from 2013-2015. After 5 years, I still wasn't able to finish my degree and withdrew from the program. I was miserable and depressed for the entire 5 years of my masters. Thankfully I found my bearings soon after, landed a full time job and have a stable career now

I'm unsure of how to display the 5 year period during my Masters. Since I didn't finish the degree, I don't want to show it on my resume. My questions are
1. Is it better to show the masters program or leave it as a gap?
2. If I leave it as a gap, what are some tips to help explain it during interviews? I did odd jobs throughout my masters to keep myself afloat, but nothing stable
3. Is there any way employers can find out about my masters program? (for example through background check programs?)"
1667,Is my salary really that bad considering my benefits?,careerguidance,"I feel stuck. I acknowledge that this is a very subjective question, I'm just looking for perspective from others.

I'm 6-7 years into my career. Just hit 5 years at my current company. I'm a senior business analyst for a fortunate 50 company based in a HCOL city.

I feel that my salary is quite low considering the above but I feel stuck because I feel the benefits I have are hard to come by. 

Base Salary: $71k \*/\*\*  
Annual Bonus: $8k

\*It's important to note that my base salary is not high enough to cover rent for a shitty studio apartment in the city in which my office is based in.  
\*\* There is NO yearly increase, not even for inflation. The only way people manage to get more money is by way of promotion/transferring to a new team (of which I have done).

While I'm not happy with my base salary, here's what's stopping me from jumping ship:

* My job went full-remote due to Covid and I will not be required to go back into the office again (even after/if covid ends). This allows me the freedom to live in various places while working remote, which I have taken advantage of and plan to continue to do so. As I was looking for jobs, I'm finding that full-remote jobs are not easy to come by and have increased competition. While not tied to the HCOL city anymore, my salary can work to maintain a lifestyle that I enjoy.
* My job is a true 9-5 with a 1 hour lunch break (that I can take whenever in the day I please). It seems that most jobs are 8-5/9-6. I love having a healthy work-life balance and I'm never expected to work over-time. I am not micromanaged and I'm free to take a few hours here and there for doctor appointments without having to use any sick time/PTO.
* As I have just hit 5 years at my company, my vacation time has grown to 26 days. My company encourages us to use all of our vacation time and we are never made to feel bad about using it. We also have an additional 9 paid holidays. We do not have separate sick days, these are apart of our vacation days.
* I receive a 6% 401k match with an additional 3% that is put in regardless of if I contribute anything. I am fully vested.

Am I correct in my thinking that all of the above is hard to come by when job hunting? I'm aware that I can make more money elsewhere but I'm scared to lose the healthy work-life balance that I have and I want to maintain a fully-remote job. I can continue to try to move up in my company but I know that leaving your company is the fast-track way of getting more money.

Is my salary really that bad considering the above benefits? I look up what the salary should be for my role in the city that I'm based in and I see I'm on the lowest end of it and that the average salary is 110k base."

Consequently, I am also interested in majoring in Computer Science. I’ll be honest I don’t know much of this field so I can’t say if I like or dislike it.

Some things that interest me of this major are the work life balance I have heard there to be in the field. As far as I can tell there is more of that “google” laid back work environment, even more options for working remotely. There also seems to be much more job opportunities and much higher pay.

&amp;#x200B;

hello,

I've been in a nice project for 1.5 years now, through a recruiter. I like it. The old contract structure &amp; deal was:

Customer ---- € 107 --&gt; Recruiter -- € 85 --&gt; me

Now Recruiter &amp; Customer got into a fight, and don't want anything to do with each other anymore.

The new proposals:

* Customer ---- €13k lump sum!!! --&gt; Recruiter to ""buy me out"" / get the right to deal directly with me
* new contract: Customer -- € ??? --&gt; me

Now this is the sequence of events:

* Customer asks me as a token of good faith to tell me the rate I got from Recruiter (€ 85), so they can negotiate best with them.
* Then they claim they are not allowed to tell me their numbers, but that they took all of that into account and came to the conclusion that it's fair for both sides when I keep getting my old € 85. That it'd take them a year to pay off the lump sum.
* I found out myself that they paid € 107 so far to the recruiter, so that the lump sum of € 13k would be ""paid off"" after 590 hours, so they'd effectively pay only € 85 after that and keep the entire difference of € 85 to € 107.
* So they say they can only pay € 85, and that is final. This was the week before Christmas.
* I counter: € 85 ok, until the lump sum is ""paid off"", which is after 590 hours. Then, the difference of € 107 - € 85 should be split: They keep 3/4 of it and pay me still only € 91. That is: Under market, € 5 less than the really good senior devs, far less than they paid so far, ...
* They make me wait until today, so all of January no work, no income. Probably departments were actually closed.
* They refuse and say it's € 85 or no deal.
* Against my argument that they won't find a replacement for that rate, not even for € 91, they said: You won't be replaced if you refuse; your position will just go away. I believe them; that's how they operated in the past. They let recruiters snatch their best for higher pay somewhere else, and didn't refill the positions.

Current market value for my work is about € 90 - € 120.

**So, what are my options?**

1. Accept the offer (won't do that)
2. Accept it temporarily until I find something better
3. Refuse and quit without even handing over my projects (I wouldn't be able to, because we have no active contract)

1689,Renegotiate Salary for So/So Position?,careerguidance,"I’m almost 5 months into a new job. My primary reason to take the job was because of a substantial salary bump. I knew I was underpaid in my previous position, needed to learn some new tricks, and try my hand at a new organization (held my previous job for 6 years). This has never felt like a dream role to me but I saw it as a stepping stone. While interviewing my personal life was very turbulent and I can’t say I was at my most attentive. This is relevant because I think I may have left money on the table for a job I was only so/so about as a result. 

At first, I wasn’t too bothered. I figured it wasn’t substantial enough of a difference to make a deal about. I figured it was my fault and I was just thankful to be paid more closely to my value. I also figured that I’d maybe do this for a year or so and then look around for something that felt more exciting. Live and you learn, right?

It’s come to my attention through some networking that I’m *still* under market value for my title in my (HCOL) city. Potentially 25k+ under market value. Meaning, there are lower level employees who might be out earning someone more mid level. I get that it’s the organization’s job to get great talent for as little as possible, however this is souring my opinion of the organization, the job, and management. If I stay a year and get an amazing raise of say, 10%, I'm still under paid. I’m feeling like I’m being taken advantage of…and this was why I decided to leave my other job even though that older role was more creatively fulfilling.

I know it’s a buyers job market for my field (I’m in project management/integrated production) - if I wasn’t as incentivized to browse, I am now. But, I'm also feeling uneasy about having to change another part of my life up again.

Which won't be done for a few months and I doubt she would be happy of news that I am looking to work outside her department especially if it means her reassigning the project again. 

Would she likely find out anyway? Should I talk to her before I apply for this other job? Thanks in advance!"

As a college sophomore, this will be my first summer seeking a ""real"" internship. However, I have a dilemma. My entire family has planned to take a special 2-week vacation during the middle of the summer. It was originally planned for 2 years ago but has been constantly pushed back due to covid. I realize one cannot just ""take a 2-week break"" at any meaningful internship, but this vacation is very special and my family has expressed that they would really like me to be there. It could be the last true ""family"" vacation before my parents are empty-nesters.

What do you all recommend? Should I apply to whatever and figure out the rest later? Should I be upfront with employers about the vacation and see where it gets me? Should I seek remote opportunities? Should I skip the vacation altogether? Has anybody been in a similar situation? 

This has been weighing on me greatly as it could have ramifications on both my career and my family relationships.

Any thoughts or comments are greatly appreciated."

1697,"I've been with them for almost two years now, should I quit or wait to see if i get the raise?",careerguidance,"SO I've been working at my job with a pretty well known restaurant chain for almost 2 years now(july). I was promoted after about a year in to team trainer instead of manager because I was leaving for college after a couple of months and I was informed that I would get a raise from what I was working at, it was minimum wage at the time, to what I'm working at now. Unfortunately, I thought that this was a good raise but it was only 50 cents more(i was a 17 turning 18 and just wanted money). To get that raise in the first place I had to wait a while since they claimed they could only do the raises during employee evaluations(which made no sense now I get to think about it because I was literally PROMOTED). 

It's almost been a year since that occured and minimum wage rose in my state to what I'm making now. Since i've been gone at college I didn't care much but now that I was back for winter break I realized that I was getting paid LESS than what the people they were having me train was. Of course this enraged me, since we were already having problems with them taking me off of L.O.A. and me not getting my money on time because they didn't do it right, so more money issues has me wanting to leave the place. I told my direct boss that I would give them two weeks of me working during my summer break for them to have my money together, otherwise they wouldn't see me again after that(i'm home at college now for the next semester). My manager said she would talk to her manager, and hopefully he gets that fixed considering they told me they cant put in those requests until the employee evaluations period come up which isnt until march?? 

Though since I'm at college now again my job that I have working here is making me consider just quitting all together from that place. It was definitely shitty environment to work in and then to deal with greedy upper management that dont want to give me my raise but make me do the work and make excuses as to why they cant do it? I would really like to quit especially since some other places near us are basically paying more but I don't know if I should just grab a second job on top of this one  during the summer since I'll need the money anyways for my next semester and they offered me maybe 2 dollars more than what I'm earning now."

I have an interest in psychology and sociology and thought about doing a Master's in IO psychology, but not sure if I would use it. 

The main issue I am finding is that I dislike dealing with people and especially customers or those I have to explain things to. Not in ""I can't deal with idiots"" way and more ""I'm autistic and I don't know how to translate my thoughts"". Many jobs using these degrees seem to have that constantly and while I can do that when needed, not every day.

I am deeply unhappy with my current position and have tried to work with my employer to find a solution. After almost 9 months of back and forth, they have presented me with a half-baked plan to move me to a different position, but that won’t take effect for yet another several months. Should I give notice and move on, or should I give my employer one more chance?

\--

Here is the background, for those who need more info:

I currently work at a marketing agency, and my first five years at this company were incredible. I worked on a major contract with the North American branch of a global brand and helped them develop national and regional marketing campaigns. I received a promotion each year that I was on the project. I was constantly challenged but was learning new skills and was well supported by a great team.

At the start of 2021, the brand took a huge hit due to COVID and they ended their contract with our marketing agency to save money. I was moved from my marketing position to a sales/retention position. My job now consists of reaching out to existing clients and trying to upsell them on our services. I have no coworkers and I have had almost no direct supervision for the past year. 

A little background about me: I have an anxiety disorder (currently receiving treatment and back on medication as a result of this position) and confrontation is not something that I handle very well. My clients are constantly challenging their results, challenging my knowledge, arguing about the quality of the services my company provides, the cost of those services, etc. I’m miserable.  I have no flair for sales, I hate conflict, and the accounts I’ve inherited are the accounts that no one else in the company wants to touch. 

I let my manager know back in April 2021 that this wasn’t a good fit for me and asked if we could work on a plan to move me to a different position. I have a massive skillset and would be a good fit in a few different departments. I was told that the leadership team was working on a solution but never heard anything definitive. In August 2021 I went directly to HR and let my manager know as a courtesy that I was widening my search for a new position within the company. Things were moving along but stalled out again. After a devastatingly bad client meeting in December 2021 that shattered the last of my self-confidence, I told my manager that I was at my breaking point. 

Last week my manager came back to me with a “solution” – the company will offload my accounts to a different team member but they won’t be able to start the process until April 2022 at the earliest. Knowing how my company works, this process will not be completed until August/September.

My manager scheduled a meeting with me for tomorrow to discuss revenue opportunities for these accounts in 2022. Should I use this opportunity to give notice and move on, or should I express to my employer that I do not accept their transition plan and would like to find a more expedient solution? Worst case they let me go, but I was prepared to resign prior to finding my next job anyway."
1704,Does a Career Like This Exist?,careerguidance,"I'm in my thirties with a career background mix of teaching and various office work. I'm really good at picking up new things quickly and can type really fast. I consider myself a fairly active person, but find it hard to workout after being in front of a computer all day. However, the monotonous tasks are killing me and so is staring at a screen 8-10 hours a day.

Last fall, my office work slowed down and I got tired of waiting for work so I took a part time position delivering packages with the purpose of getting myself out of the house. My mental health had never been better. I loved walking 4-7 miles a day, didn't mind the weather, and worked with a really great driver. Now the holidays are over, I'm back full time in the office and it's dragging. I have zero motivation. I thought about overcoming my fear of driving and take on a delivery job, but no idea if there's a future. I also don't want to spend my workday in isolation.

Is there a job that exists where there's 1) Significant physical activity like walking, 2) A healthy balance between authentic interactions with coworkers and independent/quiet time. 3) No customer service 4)decent pay($40K USD/yr), medical, vacation, year-round employment

Also, I have a bachelor's in environmental science I used when I taught(I don't want to go back to teaching)."

My GPA was 3.89. However, my dream job is to be a software engineer at Apple. I am not clear about how to make this transition, although I have made efforts to begin working toward that trajectory. I have applied, and I am waiting to hear back from a post-baccalaureate certificate program called ""The Gateway to Computer Science"" offered by George Washington University. Other than that, I do not have any connections like friends or family that work in this industry, and my general awareness and knowledge about working in the field is shallow. My degree in International Studies prepared me to be more aware and sensitive to the practices that support and undermine peoples' development and education globally, especially during childhood. I think that having awareness of social ideas has merit, and overall, I do not regret completing my degree in International Studies. Still, I regret that it was not the right choice of major considering my dream job, which was the same since I was in high school. One thing I am eager to avoid is returning to community college where I started college before transferring to a large public university, although I may be open to it. I am eager to hear suggestions about how I can make attaining my dream job possible."

1709,Take full time offer for 21% pay cut?,careerguidance,"Hi all, I am going through the process of getting a full time job offer with a top 3 advertising agency from a contract position (W2) being served through a recruiting agency. As it stands now, I am at $55hr with full benefits and 401k with the recruiting agency. That comes out to about 115k year with benefits. I also know for a fact (my boss told me) that the staffing agency is charging them about $95/hr for my services and are getting a 1 time payment of 20% my salary (boss told me) if they place me. This is also an issue and a part of me thinks the ad agency is low balling my salary to keep that cost lower. 

The recruiters are telling me the most the agency will do is 90k with benefits. Their benefits are definitely more comprehensive and their 401k offers 50% match up to the first 6% eligible pay. The company match will be 100% vested after 3 years. As far as benefits go I like the 401k but I don't really need most of the others. If I was married and having kids soon (4 months paternity leave) it would definitely be a huge plus but im not. I currently do not have details on PTO, Sick days, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

* Counter for 105k-110k
* Suck it up and take 90k because it is a great opportunity. 
* Stay as a contractor with them (which they said is fine too)

* Permanent WFH (LOVE)
* My team services 1 major client. 
* We had a crazy busy Q4 but Q1 is looking really slow so I don't envision myself being able to charge a full 40 hours per week. 
* Really great team. Lots of interfacing with VP of my team and with major stakeholders at a FAANG. 
* Fun perks that come from a major ad agency.

* This is my first actual large corporate gig which is important to keep in mind.

I make about $3200/mo. I’m looking to get out of the corporate world, while still being able to WFH. I am willing to go back to school, although wary of in person programs.  

I have my undergrad degree in Child Studies, but my last two positions have been in the corporate world. 

I’m wondering what I could do with a few years of being a research associate? (In the education sector for 3 years, HR/Admin for 2.5 years, and now in my research position for about 6 months - planning to stay for a few years). 

I had a recruiter reach out to me about a medical position with the research associate title and I was intrigued but didn’t have the education required for the job. 

Do y’all think I have to get more education to get into a field where being a researcher contributes to good rather than being in corporate? Would this increase my salary?

Additionally, if I do need a degree to supplement my skills how likely is it that companies will take online degrees seriously? 

Lastly - what other things can I do to increase my salary for whatever my next position may be? I am interested in coding, but I’m not sure how valuable (or successful for a woman of color) that could be. But I really love to learn and can pick a lot of skills up when needed.

1721,Health issues and necessary career adjustment: any guidance?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I am nearly 35 and have been working for the same consulting company for close to 10 years now after graduating from business school. I work as a manager and deliver transformation projects for the Finance function, i.e work for the CFO and its team.
Although I am not passionate about what I do, I (used to) find much interest on a day to day basis.

7 years ago, I developed health issues which basically impaired my talking (vocal cord paralysis). It was not easy but I kept going and benefited from a surgery which made my talking almost normal.
Fast forward to now: I still face this issue as it is permanent, but my condition worsened again some years ago. Doctors can't help me more and, although my voice is good, I suffer from a very disturbing throat discomfort which forces me to cough very often and refrains my talking.
As a consequence, I have trouble enjoying my work on a day to day basis, feel frustrated and depressed. Any social situation stresses me out, including family and friends encounters.

I have been thinking a lot this past year and have trouble projecting myself in this career path. It is very sad as I enjoyed it and I am successful, but I doubt I have it in me to deal with this trouble on a daily basis for many years to come. Consulting is a demanding line of work.

I don't know where to start to contemplate alternatives, hence my question here. Most high responsibility jobs require managing people, communicating, etc. which puts me under pressure compared to a healthy individual. I thought about IT and development but I am scared I would get bored quickly.
My dream job would be to manage a big farm, with a mix of physical/outdoor work and office work. But it's a dream.

Do you have ideas of jobs which could suit me best? Would you recommend I try and seek counsel from professionals on that?
Or an alternative would be that I hang tight and fight for as many years as possible although I'm not happy, so that I can have enough money to make something else.

Thank you for reading me."

Near the end of my retention period for a tech startup I sold and the acquiring company wants me to leave. Bittersweet, but ok.   
Being in the second half of my career and with this experience, I'm being invited to VP roles in early-series companies. A role like this is what I ""should do"" but will likely lead to another job few years at the company and with equity that may be good but won't be big money.   
Alternatively, there are a couple co-founders that are looking for someone like me and each are willing to give very large portions of equity (e.g. 50%) for me to join them. Both of them have users but neither of them have revenue. I love the idea of taking a concept and bringing it to market. I did this for the company I started but had a day job at the time. But something about working for companies this small makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm thinking that it will be viewed as career stagnation or even retrogression. That is, unless they are successful. 😉

**Which route should I go?**  
If I go the startup route, will I be labeled a startup guy and overlooked by established companies in the future if I want a role at one?

1727,Feeling useless and unsatisfied with my current job: what to do?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a dense one but I really need some advice on my career choices.

I am a 26-year-old Italian, who has studied abroad and was able to land a really good job back home right after attaining my Bachelors degree. At first I felt very accomplished because I did my undergrad in Public Relations, and was able to land an entry-level job in Management Consulting which is reknown to be difficult to get into, and which has nothing to do with my academic background (which made me feel like I was really capable of anything). However, my interest was always in the startup world, and/ or in international organizations, and I never really planned to work for a big corp.

Fast forward to today, I am not gonna lie: my company has supported me a lot, nurturing me ever since I started and even supporting financially a one-year Masters I undertook and recently completed (thus leaving my job for a whole year before coming back). Plus, I do enjoy the corporate life as I feel like I am part of a big family.

Looking back, I should have probably chosen a Masters that was more relevant to this position, but to be honest this was never what I intended to do. This is why, when they gave me the opportunity to, I chose to pursue a Masters in International Political Economy, which combines a bit of economics (useful for consulting), but mostly international relations, which has been my interest all along.

Now, I once again know that my company is very good and I am lucky to be part of this organization that really nurtures talent. However, I cannot help but constantly feel inadequate, due to my bizarre academic background compared to my colleagues, and also because this often prevents me from landing big projects as you need more finance/ managerial skills than I have. At the same time, I know that I could possibly work my ass off to get my team to be involved in projects that fit more closely to my background, so not only helping myself but also enriching our portfolio.

Frankly, I am just not sure if it's right for me to try and look elsewhere, or if I should be grateful and see if I can get across any projects that I enjoy. Once again, I do like this corporate world and this is a good role, however I just hate feeling inadequate and like I don't belong here all the time. I feel like a waste of money for them, and it feels like a waste of time for me.

I am aware this is a long post and I hope I provided sufficient info for you guys to understand my internal struggle.

Currently trying to be home more for my family. I have an opportunity to try a new career path in heavy highway design. The company is willing to train me using the software and have opportunities for me to branch out and be ""loaned"" out to different disciplines within the company. I have the education requirements I just never have designed anything, only ever inspected what's been designed. My pay would be lower which I expect because of my lack of design experience. I don't know if I will necessarily like design because it can be tedious work and that's a risk; however, it's a knowledge hole I have that I want to try and fill. It's also very close to home. 

The other company is a step up in position from what I'm currently doing. Basically I would be proposing to clients trying to get work for the company. I have some relationships that could be an advantage from working in the construction industry. Also be the face of the company to the client. Seems risky as well if I don't get work for them. They are a small growing company so they don't have the budget like bigger companies have for the same position (which I currently work for a bigger company). If I'm successful, it could lead to a larger pay day as we grow in capital. This job is about an hour drive from home which is farther than I want.

Long story short I saw a position open for an energy lobbying role and thought that seemed interesting. I could apply my finance knowledge and be a real asset for the company’s ambitions in the renewable space. I’ve gone through the interview process and the role would start in mid February with a base pay of $90K. 

Im just having concerns about leaving finance outright but I don’t want to be working with such a kiss ass. 

Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated so I can make a confident decision."
1735,"Climate change is my passion, but how do I make it my career?",careerguidance,"
Hey there, this is just a long shot post to see if anyone may have any insights for me. I am really passionate about climate change and would love to work in the field. However, determining precisely how I could contribute and make a career out of it is slightly tricky. 

Most entry level roles I have seen require a degree in a related field (e.g environmental science, engineering) but I majored in Business and Law. I personally do not feel that having done this degree would hold me back as I understand the scientific concepts behind climate change. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to how to enter the climate change field (whatever that is) without having to complete another degree/masters ?"

That’s something I find difficult, I just don’t really see where I fall short and how to effectively apply changes. It’s like teaching yourself to play soccer (football for the civilized world). You can do it but it’s much more effective to have someone with an outside perspective  correcting your performance. 
So my question is, does anyone have any recommendations for someone that offers this as a service?"

My team (including me) ignores this and we always try to keep everything professionall (don’t say anything), but it’s kinda very rude to say you are making 7-8x more than us, because we are underpaid for the work we do.

I really don’t have any interest in any other profession as much as I am with music (and other arts) but you know as the saying goes, it ain’t lucrative at all.

I have ADHD (and Tourette’s) and I’m already certain that I won’t make it through college if I enroll in a program with a lot of job prospects but have no interest in it whatsoever.

Lack of focus and productivity for four years isn’t exactly something I want to experience and even if I do graduate, who’s to say I’ll do even better with the actual the job.

What’s the point of working in a job that pays well if you don’t like it since you only get payed if you do well (which you probably won’t if you’re like me). Out of the 15 courses I’ve taken so far in college, I’ve only managed to finish 2 and I had to drop the rest because I wasn’t doing well with schedules.

In my mind, even with the reality of the likelihood of making it in the industry is very slim, I think my passion, more than my skill, would enable to maximize and make the experience worthwhile even if I’m not making 6 figures but just enough."

These last few months have just burnt me the fuck out though and I just have no motivation to do anything except the bare minimum. 

The work load has been very overwhelming -- not because I'm being successful and making lots of sales, but because I'm working through the issues we're facing in the industry I work in and internally (logistics and supply chain).  The team that I rely on is overworked and understaffed, so when problems inevitably arise they can't really help me or even communicate that they can't help me. We've been having tons of service issues and they're not even ones that I can try to fix and I know my team isn't behind me because they're tired too. 

I'm planning to switch industries into Data Analytics, but I still need to get the skills (est time 3-4 months) to do so and that takes time and energy which I don't have because my job seeps into my personal time and leaves me feeling drained. 

Should I look for a temp job to pay the bills while I get the skills to get the job I actually want or stay here and be miserable?

1774,Almost Mid-Life Career Crisis at 39. What should I do next?,careerguidance," Hi,  


I've seen similar posts like this, but I feel like I might be going through a mid-life career crisis at 39. A little background:  


I graduated from college in 2007 with a degree in Computer Tech. Started in computer science then switched majors. Focus in college was on web languages and databases.  


Before I graduated, I started working at local software company that focused on web design. It was very low pay for that type of work, but I came to a point where I wasn't enjoying it. I came to the conclusion I wasn't really into programming for a living.  


I left there after about a year to work for an automotive company. I was just looking for something until I graduated. It was a technician job building cables, break out boxes, reprogramming devices, and testing in cars. I enjoyed it as each day was different and I was able to do a lot of traveling as well. I did this from 2006 to about 2014. Because of a new manager, I had to get to out of the group I was in.  


I transferred to the software group in 2015 as a configuration manager. I thought it would be a good fit because of my background. My responsibilities were to baseline/release software, do testing, and I maintained an automated build server. I enjoyed the job, but was laid off at the end of 2018. There wasn't enough new projects coming and a lot of people were laid off at the time.  


In 2019, I found a job working for a similar company as the company was split before. So after being let go by one, I went to work for the other spun off company. I figured it was something I was familiar with and got the job through someone I knew. My role was supporting compilers and licenses and maintaining a few servers. At the end of 2019, my manager retired and I was kind of on my own in 2020. I had a couple of managers in name, but there was very little interaction. At the end of 2020, the company was bought out by another company. I then had a new manager, but my role changed. My new manager wanted me to be the ""configuration management expert"" and come up with a strategy for the organization and then roll this strategy out to new programs. Coming up with the strategy was the focus of last year. It was mostly my manager's already written strategy with a few changes. Now my responsibility is to roll this out to programs.  


I have a few issues right now:  


1. I don't have a huge interest in config. management/devops, but my manager picked me for it because I had some background in it. I feel like with previous jobs I knew what I was signing up for and I chose it. With this it was like I was thrown into it not by choice.  


2. My job since early 2019 has been work from home mostly. Before Covid, I went into the office some to get some interaction. Since Covid, that option hasn't been available until recently. I tried going back into the office a month ago for a week but it didn't help at all since hardly anyone was there. In fact, it was kind of depressing. I feel like I'm on an island in my group. Everyone in my group including my manager is another state. The people I'm supposed to be working with are in other countries. Personality-wise, I'm an introvert but I generally like being being around people and open up once I get to know people. Before 2019, I knew a lot of people in the office and was friends with a few people. That made going into the office more enjoyable and fun. I don't have that kind of interaction now. After the pandemic, a lot of people aren't interested in meeting up for lunch. I still have one co-worker I meet for lunch on a weekly basis, but that doesn't help much.  


3. The job itself doesn't fit who I am. I don't feel like I'm part of a team, and that's important. I feel like my work assignments aren't clear and what I'm supposed to be doing. I also don't feel knowledgeable on the subject and some of the tools that are used.  


Before the new year, I felt pretty positive about life, but that was probably because I wasn't at work for over a week for the holiday break. Now that I've resumed work, I feel more anxiety than ever. I feel like right now I have these options:  


1. Continue the job and hope things work out. I've said that before over the past year though, and I'll feel hopeful for a week but then it fades.  


2. Try to look to transfer within the company to a different job that might suit me. I'm thinking something along the lines of software/hardware validation might be a better fit.  


3. Look for a job elsewhere. This is the part that worries me the most as I'm not sure what I would want to do and feel like I don't have a lot of transferrable skills. Before I went to college, I thought I wanted to do something with software as I enjoyed hobby HTML programming. I became less interested in it later, but wanted to finish my degree so I did. I did take a couple of tests with a career counselor last year, but was disappointed with it some. It taught me some things about myself and what I want out of a job, but only offered suggestions for types of careers.  


Sorry for the long winded post. I just want to enjoy work and not dread each morning or worry. I have things outside of work that I enjoy, so that's not an issue. But work is the thing we do for 40 hours of the week, so I want that to be enjoyable. I feel like my previous jobs weren't ""work"" because I liked being there for the most part.  


I'll take any advice others might have and I'll do my best to reply."

I know how hard some people are trying to find employment (or decent employment) and just can’t catch a break. I’m in a very LCOL area (Louisiana) and making ~120k. But I’m so bored that I’m considering leaving. Maybe even taking a pay cut to leave. We work from home now, but I do have obligations that keep me from just finding fulfillment elsewhere and keeping the job. So basically it’s a time demanding job, but there’s no challenge. Being in an area with few opportunities, people looking in think I have it made. I can easily just coast into retirement in 25-30 years. But I can’t imagine doing this much longer. I have no peers in the same state, I have no advancement opportunities, I have no relationship with my boss outside of a quarterly meeting-it’s just a lonely and unfulfilling job.

I'm (29F) a corporate/commercial lawyer who's thinking of making the change into web/front end dev. Some aspects of my job that I dislike are the professional liability, always having to be risk averse, and the intangibility (you may never know if the drafting is solid until it is tested at court and that's when shit hits the fan).
Whereas web/front end dev appeals to me because it's a middle ground between design/arts and logic. The code either works or it doesn't, and you can see the results of your work.
I did a bit of web dev as a teen through designing an maintaining a personal blog and being part of the school webteam, so I do have some inkling of what it would entail.

On the ship I did a lot and have tons of certifications but nothing exactly translates to shore side roles.

1790,"I'm no longer interested in the career options for my degree, what can I do now?",careerguidance,"I'm a couple of months away from finishing my BA Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences degree with a major in International Relations. When I started it I was really interested in NGOs and other international organisations. I was an intern at WWF, Unicef and Amnesty International. But now I realised that I am no longer interested in this field. I want to do a Masters but I have no idea what kind. In my country you can only do a Masters in a specific field if you have a select number of credits in relevant studies. So I am quite restricted in trying to make any change in the direction that my education is taking right now. I was looking at the career prospects page of a MA Sociology course that sounds interesting that mentions that many of their graduates go into consulting, HR, PR and such jobs. But I am quite sceptical about this after going through a couple of reddit threads with advice on what one can do after getting a degree in Sociology.

I do not want to go back to school for another Bachelors as I'm already 23 (due to how high school is structured in my country as well as having gone on a year abroad so my BA was 4 years instead of 3)

Any constructive advice is welcome. But please refrain from snarky comments telling me to go apply to McDonalds, I do not need this kind of pessimism, I made a big choice when I was young just out of high school and I had to stick with it. People's interests change and that is just part of learning. Now I want to make to best of what I have"

1792,Indications a job interview went well?,careerguidance,"I really think I got the job, the interview was with my direct supervisor and the manager above her at the same time. The interview went long and eventually I noticed they used ""us"" and ""we"" when referring to me and my supervisor taking on projects. They also took me on a tour of the whole building and showed me ""my office"".

My confidence has shuttered lately as I have had some recent interviews not go my way, but I can't help but feel like this went exceptionally well. They did mention wrapping up additional interviews at the start of this week, but before I left the supervisor said we'd be in touch by the end of the week. Any insight?"

I am currently offered a role with a different organisation for an overall 35% increment and an improved title. 

I signed the contract after some thoughts and had the difficult conversation with my current boss about my departure. The conversation went about on their plans for me and the ethicacy of such a decision. Now I am having second thoughts on my decision mainly on the ethical aspects.

How do you manage more clients at the same time? I would like to start handling other clients at the same time too, I see a lot of ""full time"" jobs that accept also contractor (freelancers) but I'm afraid that two clients/jobs that are ""full time"" (8h) could be too much work to handle.

1807,"How does one professionally remind someone that you are their equal, and that you report to the same boss?",careerguidance,"I have a coworker that continuously delegates things to me. Will send people to work with me, and that’s really not her place to do so. She will tag me in emails and request me to look over things and find information so that she can answer upper management in conversation threads. 

The most recent request was that she wants to be included in a weekly report that I send to managers of other departments, a weekly report that I created. She wanted to be cc’d

I spoke to a relative and they asked me a few questions about who she reports to, who I report to, and reason for  / how / who I was hired (by). Turns out my relative says “she is your equal, don’t forget that. You probably have been doing small things to let her feel like this behavior is ok”. And I said “yeah we’re equals!”  But I didn’t really know that before. 

How do you cope in person when a coworker asks you about projects, asks you if you need help (when you have it under control and are better equipped than them to do your position), send you emails conversations that you’re not included in, by adding you after hitting reply all and assigning you a task. 

My relative says: ask your boss for help not her.  You two have two different roles (this is in a finance department), and when she sends you something through email, or message, reply to her only and add your boss saying: 

Dear coworker,
If there’s anything you need me to do, run it by BossesName.  I have a very busy schedule.

1809,I want to pursue a career in film but now I'm having doubts. What should I do?,careerguidance,"A little bit of background, I'm 22M and am currently living in India. I have graduated last year and have not found a job yet and do i decided to study further. I have alot of interest like music, computers, and electrical work and have worked in these lines but no of them have interested me enough to pursue it as a career. I really love film making and want to be script writer or video editor. Now to the issue, alot of people have told me not to pursue a career in film as it is very difficult and migh fail or I'm just setting myself up for disappointment, so i understand that it is a difficult line of work but it's something I'm ready to work for. So I wanted to study film in Canada and maybe get a job there, I know I'll have to start at entry level obviously. I was sure I wanted to do this until recently, I'm starting to have doubts after I spoke to an immigration consultant who has been there for 20 years and told me not to pursue a career in film as I'll be taking a loan to study as my parents can't afford it and neither can I. He told me if I don't get a job I'll have to come back and if I do come back I know I'll not be able to pay the loan. He told me to study something where I can eaisly get a job but then I'll have no contact in the film industry whatsoever. I originally didn't want to study but work my way up but film school is the only for me to build contacts because I'll be in a new country not knowing anyone or anything. So I wanted people who are working in the Canadian film industry to help me out here, is it possible? Are there jobs? I know nobody can guarantee anything and it depends on my network and my skills but how is the industry, is there an opportunity for immigrants? Also people who work in the film industry in general how is the industry right now? And also people who have migrated to Canada, can i pursue any career I want or do I have to do something where I can get a job eaisly?"

For the longest time, I've wanted to be a surgeon, and so understandably, I've been taking course work in hopes to go to medical school. I've had an event pop up that has given me the opportunity to look at possible career paths, and now after looking, I'm not quite sure what I want in life anymore. I really love science (specifically anatomy/physio) and the aspect of healing people is so amazing to me. No other career path (that I know of) presents that opportunity. I would be so happy doing that, but I also would like to enjoy my youth and care about being financially stable from the get-go, rather than 10 years down the line. Becoming a surgeon would take a long time before I start making money to pay back student loans for undergrad and med school. My youth would also be a thing of the past haha. I'm also interested in technology and business as well as traveling. I feel that the medical world is transitioning into a much more A.I and tech dominated field, and the ROI on a medical degree is decreasing. Are there other career options that give me the ability to deal with tech, business, and medicine? Or tech business within medicine? I've heard about consulting as a possible choice, but I'm not sure. I'm having one of those moments where you don't know what you want to do with your life anymore and it feels very overwhelming."

1815,Should I major in International Business Economics?,careerguidance,"hi. I'm going to be starting uni soon but I still haven't been able to make my mind up about what course I want to take up for my undergrad. 

Some context: I was initially thinking about getting a degree in psychology but I did some research and apparently the job opportunities are really bleak unless you get a phd and I'm not sure I'm ready to make that decision right now. I love psychology but what if by the end of my degree I realize I don't want to pursue it further. the thought scares me because job security is something that I really value but at the same time I know I would never want to get a degree in something I have no interest in (a STEM degree) just for the sake of getting a good salary. 

Anyway, I also really like economics and I could see myself doing (and enjoying) an undergrad in business econ (but I'm pretty sure I would not want to do my masters in it since I've heard it gets reaaaally math heavy.) I've been surfing through reddit and have read some conflicting opinions about a degree in international business but nothing about one in international business economics. 

From what I've understood, a general ""international business"" degree is not ideal as it would only give you a surface level understanding of things but employers look for specialised skills. but what about a degree in ""international business economics""?  is it any better in terms of employability? or do employers look down upon anything that starts with ""international"" ? this is the course structure btw-

1817,Pro: starting an awesome grad job soon. Con: it looks like it might be a dead end?,careerguidance,"Like the title says, after spending my 1st and 2nd year grinding through extracurriculars and soul-crushing internship applications, I managed to get an internship at a big company last summer. I got to convert it to a grad job offer, and I start in September this year (in the UK). The dream, right?

I really enjoyed my internship, and on the face of it the job is perfect. Great work-life balance, very good pay (I'll be making more than the national average), and the work is a really interesting niche. I'll be working as a market reporter, focused on writing stories about commodities and making price assessments. The only problem is that it's, well, niche.

The thing is, I have no idea where I can go from there. The progression within the company seems really flat, and I'll be in a long queue to become an editor or manager. I don't think my job role or my salary will have progressed in 5 years time, and that worries me.

The obvious next step looks like another journalism role elsewhere, but the job already pays way over the market rate and I don't want to take a pay cut. Also, I don't know if I want to be a journalist for life - what I really want is to make a hands-on impact somewhere (e.g., the energy transistion) and change things for the better.

I feel like the only way to transistion into anything else - like say policy, research, or management - is to get a Masters and start from scratch. That's at least a year of lost earnings, probably a pay cut, and a gamble on whether I'll actually get another job. So I'm not sure whether that's reasonable, either.

To be honest, I don't know when I got so conservative about risk-taking, but I was hoping that when I got my grad job that might be the end of worrying about my career for a while. Not so, it seems. I really like having a clear path in life, and while I'm in love with the opportunity I've gotten, I don't know if it's still going to be a good thing for me 10 years down the line. That is, compared to another job role with a clear progression path/lots of counterparts at other companies.

Any idea what I could do? Should I look at applying to other roles or something? Does anyone have a similar issue?"

So just some background on me. I studied geology and have a background in environmental science and geography. I worked at a groundwater consulting company for a bit, the work was okay but I got really bored after 6 months.

I resigned to spend time with my dad before he passed away from stage 4 bone cancer.

I started an MSc by dissertation and then covid happened and I basically pulled out after a ton of delays.

I'm currently working as an environmental assessment practitioner, but my company sucks and the work is really boring.

I have kind of lost my interest in geology. I liked understanding how the world worked and all the big picture stuff, but when it comes to the work that a geologist actually does its kinda meh.

I have ADHD, I tend to hyperfixate on things. So I was hoping I could find some sort of career that I would have some obsession with, but alas I have not.

I am really good at picking up problems/identifying issues, I like responsibility/pressure and big picture stuff. I really don't like nitty-gritty boring work. I am good with people. 

Any suggestions?"

I am 28 years, and I have a business management diploma that I got at 26. The courses I took were very broad regarding accounting, marketing, operations, HR, etc.. I have been having trouble getting a job since I graduated in 2020. After many months of looking and researching, I found that narrowing my skill horizon to one specific skill is my best option. So basically, instead of a just being a business management, I would narrow it down to like an accountant for example.

So now here's my dilemma. I am 28 years old with no experience, and looking to find a specific career to get into. What are some specific career paths that I can start and get into ? I can do 2 more years and get a bachelor, but what would it be in? What is something more simple that I can do a few courses in online, and start looking for a jobs in it right away even without experience? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

1826,"I was terminated from my position after training for one week with the company, and I’m not sure if I should reach out to the owner of the company or not. I really need some advice?",careerguidance,"
I’m so incredibly sorry for the long read. There’s just a lot of layers to this situation as to why it’s bothering me. I didn’t proof read, because I am feeling down &amp; just didn’t feel like it. I also want to state that I know I won’t get the position back, and that’s not even my goal here. I’m going to move on and look for a new job, but part of me wants to send a polite email to the owner, and here’s why:

So I moved to a new city in the last quarter of the year because I needed a more affordable place, and the new location provided more opportunities for work. I had been applying for jobs on indeed nonstop, and was getting a lot of responses for interviews whenever this one company (who will remain nameless) reached out to me for an interview. This company offered amazing pay and 100% paid benefits so I was really intrigued. The only downside was I sent my resume in Oct. 2021 and the job training wouldn’t start til Dec. 2021 because the company wouldn’t be getting the keys to their new office til Jan. 2022. I completed three interviews over the course of the month, and was offered the position by the owner of the company on Nov. 22, 2021. I didn’t have enough in my savings to stay unemployed til the training started so I had got a job as a server. Now I stuck with this job even though the tips weren’t great, but I didn’t think it would be fair to another business to waste their time training me &amp; doing all the paperwork just for me to leave within a month since my upcoming job was a full time position. 

I was told immediately after accepting the position that I would be receiving a laptop from the company with the uploaded software to do our training via video conferencing starting on Monday, Dec. 20. On Dec. 14, I received an email from the manager who would be training me, asking if I was still onboard to start training on Tues., Dec. 20 &amp; if I would let her know once completed all the paperwork on ADP. I responded on Wed., Dec. 15 that I was still onboard to start training on Dec. 20, and that I had completed all the paperwork on ADP. I also notified her that I hadn’t received my work laptop and asked if it was something I should be expecting in the mail, or if i would need to meet someone to pick it up. I never heard anything back from her so by that Saturday, Dec. 18, I sent a follow up email asking about the work laptop &amp; if there was anything I could do to make it easier for me to acquire it. I told her I would follow up via text on Sunday, Dec. 19, if I hadn’t heard anything back from her just in case my emails were going to her spam folder. When I hadn’t heard anything back 2pm the next day, I sent a follow up text, and then another text around 5:30pm when I still hadn’t heard anything. At this point, I start to panic so I finally decide to email the owner of the company, around 7pm letting him know that I was trying to get an update on my work laptop because I didn’t want to miss any of the training &amp; really wanted to excel in the position. I did let him know all the times I had reached out to my manager, and that I was just trying to find out if the training had been postponed. I received a call from the owner the next day letting me know that my laptop would be ready Tues., Dec 21 and that I could pick it up from his home. I received a very short and unapologetic text from my manager that same day stating she had been driving all day and thats why she didn’t respond. Two people were hired for this position, and I was under the impression that neither of us had received our laptops, but instead the other girl did receive her laptop and was able to train those two days that I wasn’t able to train. I wasn’t aware of this and assumed we had received the same amount of training. The manager cancelled training (at the very last minute both days) for the days, Fri., Dec. 24 and Mon., Dec. 27 which were supposed to be training for half of the day. She said I would still be paid for half a day both days. I let her know that Monday that my child had a stomach virus, and that I was working out another plan for the next day since she couldn’t go to daycare. As luck would have it, I ended up getting the stomach virus in the early hours of Tues., Dec 28. The second week of training was supposed to take place in the new office, and I let her know around 5am that I had been sick all night and I wouldn’t be able to come in for training. I’d give anything to go back in time and just go in sick, but I can’t change that now. I was in bed for the entire day of Tuesday, with a trash can by my bed. I felt better the next day and sent her a text the next morning if it was okay that I come in the office for training. My last job had a strict policy for this that you couldn’t come back in for 3 days if you had been sick after the covid outbreak, so I just wanted to confirm with her that I could come in. I never heard back from her which I thought was weird, but I wanted to be close by in case she said I could come by so I drove the 30 min drive to a gas station close to the office and waited til I heard something from anyone in the company. 

She text me and asked if I could come in around 12:30 and told me to bring my laptop, charger, and a notebook. When I arrived, she had a talk with me about missing work and said that she felt like I was really behind on training and that I had missed a lot and wasn’t ready to start working. Confused that I was behind by missing just one day, she reminded me that I also missed the 2 days the previous week whenever I didn’t have my laptop. This is when I found out that the other girl had received her work laptop on time. I apologized to her for missing work and let her know that I was taking this position seriously, and that I wouldn’t have missed work for no reason at all. She said she wasn’t sure what they were going to do moving forward because she wasn’t sure when she would have time to train me again, and that she would be talking it over with the owner and the guy right below him, Mike. She said that she didn’t want me to have to look for another job after waiting this long on this job, but she would just have to talk it over with them and figure out what they wanted to do. She said she was going to call Mike after I left and that he would be calling me. Mike called me and told me that it was important for me to be available for training because my manager was taking time from her work day to train us, and that this was a great opportunity. I told him I knew that it was a great opportunity and that I wanted to succeed in this position more than anything, and he said that everything I was telling him told him that I wanted it, so now I needed to prove it to him. He told me to go ahead and come into the office on Monday, Jan. 3. He said something along the lines if I was going to miss work that I needed to report into him instead of my manager. Well Sunday night, it snowed several inches which is very rare for Middle Tennessee, so the roads weren’t salted, but that’s my luck. I text Mike around 6:30am asking if he knew that road conditions for around the office (since I lived 30 minutes from the office). I never heard anything back from him, so I went into the office despite the hazardous road conditions. When I get there, I was told by the other business working out of the office that they were told by my manager that they were all working from home this week. They told me I was welcome to wait around til I heard something back from someone so I went out to my car to text my manager. I sent her a text, asking if I misunderstood what Mike had told me. She replies with, “Hey Mallory, we are not in the office this week. I'm sorry no one communicated that to you. I did not know he told you to go in. I'm dealing with something right now and waiting to hear from Curt so I can give you more information later.” That’s a direct quote &amp; *Curt is owner by the way* 

I immediately called my sister after reading her text, and I was only on the phone with my sister for 1 minute whenever someone walked out to my car and knocked on my window. It was Alan, the company’s HR guy. I immediately recognized his name as he introduced himself. I asked him if he was working out of the office this week, and he said no that he had just stopped by to check the place out, and when he walked in that they had told him one of his coworkers was out in the parking lot. I told him I had just received a text from my manager and that I was going home for the day. He says bye and I get in my car and leave. The next day, Tues., Jan. 4, I receive this email:

Good Morning Mallory,

Unfortunately, we found that you are not best suited for this position and we are going to go in another direction. We appreciate your efforts in joining us and wish you nothing but the best in your journey.

I’m so damn confused and upset. I just don’t understand what happened. I get that I missed a day of the training but something just isn’t sitting well with me. Sorry for the long read. I want to reach out to the owner and ask if there was something else I did because I mean, I interviewed 3 times and the last interview was a 2 hour long dinner interview with the owner, who told me that it was very hard to get fired from his company, and that I would have to want to get fired. Also, I told both Mike and my manager that I had found a daycare within 10 minutes of the office &amp; that I was going to go ahead and pay the tuition and registration fees for it, and withdrawal her from her current daycare which is closer to where I live which is 30 minutes away. I know he doesnt legally have to give me any explanation and may not even open the email. I’m just really hurt over this because I feel like I didn’t even have a fair chance from the jump. Ive wondered if maybe I ticked off my manager by emailing the owner over the laptop situation. My confidence is shattered. I turned down 3 interviews the 2 weeks after being offered the job. I stuck with a shitty serving job instead of finding a new serving gig so that I wouldn’t waste anyone’s time training me for me to leave after a couple weeks. I just feel like this is wrong. Idk. I’m going to move on. I know I won’t get the job back, but I want to email the owner. I’m aware he may not even open it, but I feel like I need this closure. What would you guys do?"
1827,Frustrated puzzle solver looking to get into coding/programming; where do I start and what do I look for?,careerguidance,"I’m looking for a change in career - something that relies less on other people than my current position*. Work in which I can live and die by the sweat of my own brow, as it were.

So that led me to programming. I know that’s like saying “that led me to an office job” - I’m painting with a huge, vague brush. But that’s why I need guidance.

First, I want to make sure I have two things right.

1. It’s my understanding, though I invite corrections, that programming is problem solving. Or better yet, puzzle solving. It’s using purely logical thinking. It’s talking to rubber ducks to figure out why something’s not working. And most importantly, it’s you vs. the machine. It’s not asking your coworker to give you a line of code and then asking a member of another team to compile it and waiting for weeks for them to finally get to it… and do it wrong. You get in there yourself. You make it happen. Your project is your own. And that’s all REALLY appealing to me.

2. I also understand programming to be somewhat lucrative. I’m currently paid $75k a year, and I’d love to not take a pay cut to switch careers. I’ve heard more than one story of “friends of friends” who took a coding boot camp and now make $85k+. When working with a recruiter to hire a new team member, I learned that candidates that knew a programming language would cost about $10-15k more.

I am very left-brained, but so far my experience is a single class in Java in high school and getting pretty creative with Excel formulas.

My current work involves a lot of data, which I’d happily do more of, but I’m not locked into that. Honestly, I just want to sit in a room and solve puzzles. I know all companies have politics and bottlenecks, but my current company is such an organizational cluster that I’m just dying to find something a little less… interpersonal. Plus, I’d like to further explore the depths of my left-brained talents and tendencies.

But I have NO idea where to start. What fields should I be exploring? What boot camps might make the most sense for me? Do I have the right idea about what it means to code, or am I doomed to suffer control freak upper management and incompetent coworkers my entire life? (And if so, how tf do I cope?)

*My job: I currently work in internet marketing. Go out, spend money on ads to get email addresses, get those users to eventually spend enough money on average that we make a profit.

I actually really like the business model and even the product, but I’m finding myself more and more frustrated. Any time I want to accomplish something, it’s like the 14 Stations of the Cross. First, I have to find time when I’m not helping everyone else at the company with basic data analysis, or when I’m not being asked for reports and summaries and updates from higher ups, or when I’m not doing some rote task or explaining to a coworker for the upteenth time what THEY need to be doing.

Then if I DO have the time, actually accomplishing the tasks is next to impossible because I can’t just, say, set up an email series. I have to chase down copy from people who are too lazy to write it, then I have to wait for weeks while the actual “tech” people make it happen (even though I could do it in 30 minutes, but I get yelled at if I do it myself), then I have to go in and fix it anyway after they do it wrong because they didn’t understand the objective or just didn’t care, and then when it inevitably breaks because all of our systems are trash, I have to wait for weeks or even months to get any support for it. So I’m pretty starved for autonomy right now."

1829,Working to get my degree in criminal justice but not sure anymore.. Is it worth it? If not what should I switch my major to?,careerguidance,"I'm sad because I keep seeing people say a criminal justice major is not useful, I always watched csi shows when I was younger so I developed a interest in it, but it seems like a lot of work to actually make a good amount of money and I don't want to be wasting my time.

I really need advice"
1830,Can my employer fired me for being sick?,careerguidance,"I live in an at-will state. I’ve been sick for the past week and been staying home. On my 3 day that I called in I went and did a Covid test just to be safe my test came out negative which is good. 

I contacted my company HR and they told me if my test is negative I can go back to work but they recommend me to stay until I feel better before going to work.

I feel but better now but still have minor cough and fatigue I texted my boss that I will probably stay one more day and go back to work on Tuesday just to be safe. I have a feel my boss is piss of at me. Can he fire me because I miss 1 week of work for being sick?"
1831,Should I quit or keep trying?,careerguidance,"I was recently hired and joined an entirely brand new team. I was hired with the expectation to provide an outside perspective and share what I know of industry standards.

As context, my 4 team members were all promoted internally with an established working relationship of 2-3 years from being on a different team together. We don't have a direct team manager and instead have 3 temporary stand-in managers from other teams who rotate coverage until we find a permanent manager.

I immediately noticed that the team wasn't very organized. Coming in, I was told by one of the managers that the team was supposed to have some onboarding/training plan for me once I joined. That never happened, so I made suggestions to let me shadow them, forward me emails so I can just pick apart context myself, or to give me names of people at the firm who I can network with and get to know. That still didn't happen through three weeks of consistent follow up - I was always told they were ""finalizing"" the content to share (still never happened).

Disorganization continued to be a trend from seeing them come unprepared to meetings and not have any updates on team projects, and my suggestions to organize team efforts are ignored. This comes after sitting them all down to communicate this challenge, ask for help, and try to think of solutions together (like asking about their working style). They agree they don't want this to be a recurring issue, blame it on not having a manager, then it's back to the same situation.

I tried to change my approach and decided to just do things on my own. I tried to organize team meetings and went ahead with projects, asking the team for feedback but getting none. My recent concern is I started noticing one of my team members would take credit for my work during our meetings with our temporary manager(s). She'd offer the same suggestions I'd mentioned just between us 5 or imply she was the one who completed a project. 

At this point, I'm frustrated and I don't know what else I can do to alleviate this situation. Being stuck between 3 managers with partial coverage, I don't want them to think I'm throwing the others under the bus, especially as the only non-internal person here (that's honestly been the hardest part to all of this). Is there anything else I should try doing, or is the best option to just find another job? 

Any input would be much appreciated. Thank you!!"
1832,"Bachelors in ""Medicine""...what job??? idk what to do",careerguidance,"My next step is to study for a bachelor's at a poor country university. Although i passed all my courses i didn't get a scholorship.

I have no idea on what profession i want to become, and desperately need help and talk to an experienced person who holds a bachelor in the medical field or a person who is currently studying for a bachelors to help me break down what road im going to take or at least foresee. 

If it helps ive thought of doing something in the psychology part and being a doctor...i have no idea what kind and thats where i need an expertise to tell me straight up. I dont care being offended im too desperate rn to see a career path for me. Perhaps what i want to do may not even be in these two words. I just know i want to give or help.

I'm an average student really and right now, before registration happens and before my parents pay almost 800 for each enrolled course. My family is in the engineering field and do not know much in experience.

Please dm me and i'll get to you tonight."
1833,"Potentially quitting a taxation internship due to medical reasons, consequences?",careerguidance,"I have a dislocation on my foot and probably some messed up ligaments and tissues like two weeks ago. I can barely walk-around without assistance and it really hurts. I have informed my employer of my injury two weeks ago and they allowed me to work remotely. At this point, I wonder would it be wise to quit the internship due to my injury? -- It is lingering me and my recovery/rehab process is slow. I am basically worn out by my dislocated foot, work and academics. I might have to spend more time focusing on academics and rehab. Will my employer put me on a blacklist for quitting/will I burn bridges if I quit? (It is like only three weeks into the internship that lasts till April and the first two weeks are more orientation/training base -- I am afraid that they might get mad at me)."
1834,When to start applying for new job when moving?,careerguidance,"My partner and I would like to leave our current city (Atlanta) and try something new. We wouldn’t move until summer time (June 2022) and haven’t settled on a place yet. 
We both prefer remote working or atleast hybrid.

I was curious to see what options are out there in the states we’re interested in. While doing this I saw a posting for a company I’ve always wanted to work for. I think I have a good shot at it and it’s a fully remote position. The position stated employees could work from all three of the states we’re considering. 
I’d really like to apply! But it doesn’t feel like the right time, give my move to unknown state/time zone. I worry it will be gone in a couple months when I’m ready.

I feel like I shouldn’t be applying to jobs until we’ve decided on where to live, but it’s hard when I see listing at companies I’m really interested in. 

Any advice on how to handle the above and finding remote work while moving to a new city is appreciated! 

Ps- we’re debating on CA (San Diego), CO(Denver), and FL(Tampa). Which are all on different time zones!"
1835,Which field to choose - MBA/CPA/Project Management?,careerguidance,"Hello, 

I am a 25-year-old looking for some guidance for my career. 

I am very confused with my career because I am not sure what I want to do in the future. I did my undergrad (Bachelor of Arts - Business degree with an Economics major – Finance specialization - Co-op degree) from one of the good universities in Canada but I really don’t know what field I want to get into. I graduated in June 2020. My first job out of University started in Feb 2021 until Sept 2021 and I switched jobs in October 2021.

Most of my co-op (*internships*) jobs were related to Accounting/ Finance field but I am very scared to do CPA as I failed majority of my accounting/ finance courses at university. I am not sure if doing like a master’s in Accounting/ Finance will help me land a high paying job. I did a major in Economics but don’t have any interest in Economics. I liked the general business courses at university but obviously to grow in my career, I need to pick a field. I am confused between MBA (Major not decided yet but might pick either Finance/ Accounting or Strategic/ Project Management), CPA (*Accounting &amp; Finance*) and Project Management (*includes CAPM/ PMP/ Six Sigma/ Scum Master*). I was hoping to get like a Business Analyst job out of university, but most BA roles require technical knowledge and I lack that. I managed to land myself a Financial Clerk (*contract*) role with the provincial government, and it wasn’t a core Accounting/ Finance job. It was sort of making a record of payments on the respective case. Pretty basic nothing complex.  

My current job is in the Business Intelligence team (*all software developers*) at one of Canada’s telecom company’s but honestly, I feel I am not adding a lot of value and don’t see a lot of growth unless I add some reporting skills (SQL/ Excel/ Power BI etc.) &amp; professional certifications like PMP/ Six Sigma/  Scum master etc. Getting these certifications will allow me to move to the project management team but again I am not even sure if I want to get into project management. I took this job thinking I might enjoy it as I was not sure about finance/ accounting field but even this job is not fulfilling or interesting. I thought this job will involve some budgeting for projects, but it is more admin and just dealing with day-to-day stuff and running basic (that do not require technical knowledge) projects. I was mostly rejected by the employers for any Accounting/ Finance roles as I do not have any courses from university. I get the basic accounting/ finance concepts but just the basics. 

I have an offer of admission from Wilfred Laurier University in their MBA program (*right now its full time with co-op – 12 months school and 8 month internship and will commence in September 2022 – total cost around $32,000 CAD*) but I can put in a request to change it to part-time MBA (3 years – alternate weekend classes – *total cost around $60,000 CAD*). But I am very confused if I should do my MBA yet. Also, in case I do accept the offer and start part-time, I don’t know if I would be able to manage school with a full-time job. I personally don’t want to quit my full-time job as it will help me fund my education/ daily expenses. The main thing is I am confused if you know spending $60,000 over 3 years will give me that salary boost once I graduate. I spoke to my current manager, and they suggested that in my current company, MBA won’t add a lot of value. 

Based on my profile, what field would you suggest? 

Thank you so much for your inputs and feedback. They are greatly appreciated."

1839,Pros and Cons of a career in HR?,careerguidance,"Looking into degrees to start and I’m considering one in Human Resources Business Management.

However, I don’t know the ins and outs of that kind of career fully. What would you say you enjoy most/least about it?"

I have no idea what i want to do.

1) What type of certifications should i be looking at getting? (Was thinking digital marketing?? Idk man!)

2) What type of jobs should i be looking for? (I guess I want to optimize my income, again idk)

1841,Should I change jobs?,careerguidance,"
Lets start from the beginning, I've left collage in hopes of headstarting my career coz as I've heard from multiple sources""You don't need school to be successful"".
Looking back it was stupid but here I am.
I moved to UK as I believed it will be easier for me to make money and make living, I've had couple jobs at first started on minimal wage  and going up swapping jobs every couple months.

I've had quite decent job 14£/HR but a lot of traveling so also costs of food as I can't cook in the hotel, after a while I got sick of it carrying my luggage back and forth every 3/4days while realistically I couldn't even save up due to having to pay for food and often transport.

Then I've got a pretty decent offer I thought 10£/HR during trial period and my real salary to be talked through after the trial. That seems nice so I left my job and hopped on the train

The company I work for is having some problems at the moment and its going for the last few months I'm slowly running out of money and for some reason I don't necessarily want to share on internet I have to move somewhere else, not as a city just different apartament .

In my current state I'm unable to save up a penny as I'm getting maybe half of the hours I should and after paying all the bills and stuff I'm left with bout 100£ to survive the month.

Long story short I'm fucked.

I believe I should change jobs but whenever I look at offers nearby they require degrees or experience that I don't have and the jobs that don't are either far away or pay minimal wage what concerns me if I could live on it.

My employer keeps stating that the problems will end soon and to hold on just a tiny bit longer, and personally I can see it all coming to an end soon enough but I'm scared as if it takes 2months more I'll have to go homeless if I swap jobs I might not be able to afford to rent an apartment anyway as deposits are damn high when you can't save up anything.

I'm trying really hard to hold it all together but I'm not good at adulting really I don't know anything about taxes bills or anything that I actually should know about when going into adult life.

I'm not trying to make it some kind of feel bad story give me money I just need some help in deciding on my next moves as landing on the street isn't really my cup of tea

TL:Dr  If I change jobs I'm gonna earn less and I'm sceptical if I can survive, if I stay I might not survive either as I need to move somewhere asap while not having any cash

(I'm sorry if it's a mess but I'm not natively speaking English so please forgive me and if you see mistakes feel free to correct me.)"
1842,Stuck between opportunities— help?,careerguidance,"This post might be long— will try to keep it as short and simple as possible. 

I interned for an elected official for two years. Post-graduation, I moved into the private sector of government and have been working admin at a lobbying firm. 

The lobbying firm has promised growth, offers great benefits, and is a great work environment. I feel appreciated and I love my co-workers a lot. 

I recently was contacted by my old boss, asking if I would be interested in taking over her position as Chief of Staff for the elected official. This position would pay a better salary, the same benefits, and I loved working in the legislature. 
Here’s my hang-up: The gov is about to be in session, which means BOTH jobs are about to get V E R Y busy for the next 3-months. 

If I were to take the CoS position, I would be leaving my firm 1.5 weeks into the busiest 3 months of the year. 

The CoS position, however, is full-time for the 3mo that we’re in session and part-time the other nine months (though I would be salaried).
I know my heart is telling me to take the position for the elected official. But my guilt/anxiety brain is telling me that it  would be awful leaving my current position right when they’d need me most. 

Any advice is appreciated plz. Do I stay and endure a job with great benefits and that is full/time year round?  Or do I take my chances with a job I’d love but is part time 9mo the of the year— I’d also be screwing my current company to take this new position."
1843,"Jobs that require good people skills, but not 100% of the time?",careerguidance,"My current job is in sales, particularly in private large-scale event planning. This is my first time in this role, and I’ve realized I am really good at lead conversion and closing the sale, but I am absolutely burnt out by the constant communication with clients. Phone ringing off the hook, hundreds of emails, etc.. Even in the slow season! If there is any point when I am not speaking to someone, I am probably not doing my job. 

I do enjoy working with the general public, and have been told I have great people skills, which has gotten me where I am without a college degree. In my dream role, I would be able to use my skills but have a good amount of responsibilities that do not involve talking, via phone or email. Even 50%-75% communication would be okay, but I get so tired and find myself procrastinating a LOT and needing multiple short breaks a day due to wanting a brain &amp; voice rest. 

Any advice or recommendations for a new move? I don’t plan on leaving soon, but I am wondering if I am likely in the wrong career right now due to my preferences."
1844,Thoughts on which direction to head in my career?,careerguidance,"I feel very split on where I should go in regards to my career. I work a food delivery job that I enjoy a lot due to the flexibility, ease, and nature of the job. It gives me the space to learn through audiobooks/podcasts on the job and keeps my ADHD brain engaged. I don’t necessarily feel challenged though and feel as if it’s not the route I want to ultimately head towards. The pay is relatively good as far as delivery jobs go. However, I would like to make more money, stop putting wear on my personal vehicle, and have greater job flexibility (currently working 6 days a week) so I can devote more time to my craft and land in the career I’m aiming to be in.

 I have a BA in music and am looking to become a full-time music producer after enough self-education and experience. I practice and learn before/after work daily and on days off, but its a process that will take a great deal of time, effort, and money unfortunately. I’d like to not land myself in more student debt than I already have so I’m not looking for courses necessarily. I have however, been in contact with music studios looking at possible internship opportunities for hands on experience. I do intend on doing this full time one day but am trying to support myself financially and with enough time to build a foundation that will pay the bills.

While I’m okay with in-office employment, I am looking for fully remote work, preferably a Results Only Work Environment so I can stop ‘working’ when the job is done and can focus my energy towards production. I’m also eager to remove the need for commuting and to be in my own space.

Here are some possibilities I have been working at or actively considering in pursuit of making more money and having more time:

-Tech: Others have told me I would probably be good at coding and I have friends in the industry. The aspects of reliable income, having connections, and always being in demand are pretty appealing! I just started a coding bootcamp but I wouldn’t really know where to go from there or even what branch of tech I would go into.

-Finance: Growing up poor, I had the realization that in order to make money I should understand the basics of it. I have a passion for personal finance but have large gaps in knowledge or understanding of certain aspects of it. I would be willing to work with an employer that would work with me as I train and learn the things that are essential for the job.

Mental health coaching/research: I have sunk a considerable amount of time into learning about mental health issues as a way to help myself. I would love to coach people who struggle with issues such as depression and anxiety, but especially ADHD. However, I don’t see opportunities in this field without at least a bachelors in psych (and rightfully so).

-No experience employment: I am an avid and eager learner at heart and would be glad to be trained at something novel and engaging as long as its flexible and pays enough!

Looking to make $40k+ so I’m not taking a pay cut.

I don’t want a job, I want a life. I hope that doesn’t make me sound like a spoiled brat, but that’s just how I feel. I’m sorry if it offended anyone, it’s absolutely not my intention.

I think another reason why I’m also kinda reluctant to quit is due to the fact that the job market is tough. I’ve been applying to different jobs now but haven’t even heard back from any one of them. But this job is costing my mental health and I know I have to do something about it too.

Also, I’ve been unemployed for a year due to Covid right after I got out of college. I know quitting would probably harm my future chances of getting another job. But I just can’t anymore.

Is this normal in some industries? Are they inviting a bunch of people and then setting up interviews? The email doesnt talk about the actual interview. This is a job in a police station as a regular staff member."
1855,Is it time to quit?,careerguidance,"I’ve been at my current job for a bit over two months. Prior to that, I was at my other job for 7 years in the same field. I decided to leave because the new job pays more and is fully remote. 

Even though it’s the same position, the job is different since the processes and structures are different. My training consisted mainly of watching videos which I want practical. After about two week, I had all of this work dropped on me. No one has really explained the expectations and the system to get the actual work done is cumbersome and the system is not intuitive. I feel like it’s been a swim or sink situation.

I’ve had anxiety dealing with the job which is starting to affect my physical health. I’ve tried not to let it get to me but it’s harder to do that. I want to do the best I can but I feel like I’m being set up for failure. People typically work long hours and will even work while on vacation. From talking to my cousin-workers, raises don’t really happen and you have to leave and go to another company for one.

The Sunday scaries do kick in for this job. Should I quit? I can comfortably afford to until I find something else less. Or do I just do the bare minimum, not care and look for something else!"
1856,Janitor tired of the job and unsure what path to take next?,careerguidance," 

I'm  37 and I'm a janitor at a trucking co. I've held cleaning jobs from restaurant to senior living to daycare...a bit over a decade cleaning jobs. I've always looked for ""cleaning"" jobs because I can usually do my thing and have less face-to-face interaction with customers, which I  have had a job working on the floor and dreaded every working day.

The current job isn't hard, but I'm just burnt out on doing this type of job anymore.  I've been wanting to be a front-end web dev,  but teaching yourself isn't easy in that you need to have the drive and there's part of me that keeps telling me it may not be for me. 

I honestly feel part of me wants a desk job, but I don't want to do any call centers.  I've thought about IT, but again I'm unsure if it would be a good fit or if I would even be able to do such a job? I would like a remote  job...that's one thing I'm certain about, but like a lot of people, have  no real-world skills and feel like ""Where or how to go about this?"""
1857,"Just got a new job, can anyone offer some advice on my situation?",careerguidance,So I have been unemployed since October and I got hired on at a company that originally wanted to do a 6 month contract to hire but I declined the offer. The VP of technology sent me an email a couple weeks ago offering me a position starting at $30/hr with roughly 9-15 hours of O.T. every week. My line of work is building machines for automation outfits mostly doing the electrical aspect of things. He told me they want me to train under their lead and take his place when he retires in a few years. I feel like this is a good opportunity to learn a lot in my industry. I just turned 32 and want to start saving for retirement but they only offer 2% match on 401K. The health insurance is okay but my wife and daughter will most likely be on her plan. Any advice for starting after a long stretch of not working? I feel like I might need a month or so working just to shake the rust off and get back in the swing of things. The commute is also 30ish minutes each way. Just want to make a good impression after my last job left a bad taste in my mouth. Thanks reddit for any advice/input.

so i've used the reddit search option to see if someone else has already answered this question but a lot of the answers were a bit vague and a tad confusing.

so, i have an AA in business administration and almost 5 years experience in the clothing-retail business. (i'm 24F based in california). i've always been fascinated with how certain stores and advertisements entice consumers to shop or apply for a store-based credit card. i've always been interested in marketing for this very reason and i want to learn more about what consumers want.

i know that i may have to pursue a bachelors and i was thinking of majoring in marketing. is there anything else i should know or learn or read?

1860,Should I leave my full-time job for a contract offer?,careerguidance,"After applying to jobs for months, I finally got an offer! But there are some major things to consider...

**Pros**:  
\- Huge, very well-known company, would look great on my resume.

\- Loved the people who interviewed me; they seemed like a team I would really enjoy being a part of. I asked a ton of questions and saw no red flags.

\- Fully remote!! This was something that I was hoping to find but wasn't sure I'd get.

**Cons**:  
\- They are offering me an 18-month contract with the ""possibility to go full time."" The recruiter said they often see people get put on full-time after 3-4 months if they are doing well. (I know she could just be saying that.)

\- Benefits are through the contracting company for the duration of the contract, and they are fine but not great. I will also have no paid vacation unless/until I get hired permanently.

\- Pay is only 2k more than my current job, and they refused to negotiate but said I could renegotiate if/when I am brought on permanently. The salary is slightly above the national average, but I really expected more from such a big company...

**Summary**:  
I've had a very stable full-time job through the pandemic, and I am afraid of losing the stability, my health benefits, and paid vacation time... But on the other hand, I am young with no kids or mortgage, and I am looking to advance my career, so maybe now is the time to take these risks and get the big name companies on my resume?

I am sort of in a “strategic”/planning role and not really in a core Dev/tech role. I’m interested in the technical project management career field, but I feel like I am not technical enough.

1866,What do you all suggest for me to do?,careerguidance,"Hello all, I am in my senior year of high school in the US and applying to programs this year. I am thinking of travelling down the pharmacy and path and maybe getting a PharmD with a PhD down the road. I am not very smart at the moment - mostly because I have not gotten the chance to do much in life because of restrictive parents. Now that I have accidentally mentioned this plan to my father, he seemed annoyed because the earning potential is about $200k (USD) and is ‘nothing’ compared to other jobs. I want him to get off my back so what would help me earn more money in future? 
In addition, I don’t think I am interested in much science other than biology and pharmacy, and I am not interested in liberal arts. I would perhaps like to be in entertainment, like a model or a comedian, but I want to earn a decent amount of money early. However, I am aware that this could potentially go awry or at least, may not earn enough money. I want to not rely on my parents but I would sort of like to be famous (so I can earn more money lol. That’s the end goal and that seem to be the only way). 
I understand that I may sound lazy. Just to be clear, I am willing to work as hard as I need to to get myself to such prestigious places. I am not scared of work. I just don’t want to be pushed into doing something that I will not be good at doing. And I want to be successful without relying on others’ income(s). 
I know that this is a long post - I appreciate all who respond and will try to get back to you. I am open to DM responses from this post as well. I haven’t learned a lot about life, which is why I am asking adults on Reddit instead of my parents who want to control my personal life and finances in the future.
Also, I am an Asian girl who is also an only child, which is why my parents are so controlling and demanding (reputation matters to them and sadly for me as well). Also, as a function of being a girl, I will not respond to creepy comments or DMs. I will however respond to comments of confusion over my wording (also I wrote this in a hurry so that would be expected)."

I accepted a FT offer in a back office position at a BB and am only now finding out about the stigma and lack of challenging work that comes with it. I have been considering other careers in the consulting and tech industries, and already have the name of the BB on my resume from a summer internship (which is where I received and accepted the offer last August).

It is now January and my start date is in a few months. I am considering applying to other roles, although I am worried that it might be too late to renege on the initial offer.

Advice on what I could transition to?,careerguidance,"I’ve been working customer service jobs since I was 19 and now I’m 25. I am incredibly burnt out to due to obnoxious customers and overwork and want to transition into something different, but not sure what. 

For the past 3.5 years, I’ve worked at a major well-known insurance company as a short term disability case manager. I have tried to make it work with this company and this role but I’m at my wit’s end with it. I tried transitioning to other roles / being promoted internally but they keep blocking me and refusing to move me despite good performance. I am completely over the triple or quadruple caseload, the managers always up my butt telling me I’m not good / fast enough, the phones constantly ringing, the people yelling in my ear how I’m ruining their lives. I’m at the point where the sound of the phone ringing or the chime of an email coming in makes my heart rate spike and my stomach feel like it’s dropped to the floor. I tried to stay because it’s remote with good pay and benefits but now I’d like to leave the job completely. 

I’d like to switch gears away from customer service / constantly being on the phone. I only have a bachelors in psychology and not willing to return to college at this time. For the past six months I’ve been working on a web development class and that’s my ultimate goal; I was originally going to keep working this job until I was ready to start the web dev career. Ideally I’d like the new role to be remote or able to find a remote position and paying at least $50k a year. I enjoy writing and problem solving.

1870,When should I start my job search?,careerguidance,"I want to find a job in Maine to be closer to family. My fiance, whose family is also in Maine, works remote, so her job would not be affected by our move. There are a few factors that we are trying to consider that makes the timing of my job change crucial. The primary being our wedding at the end of May and the honeymoon the week after. Ideally, I would like to start a new job after this so I don't have to request so much time off as soon as I start.

Financial considerations: I started my current job exactly a year ago and they paid for my relocation. If I leave this job between 12-24 months of my start date, I am responsible for returning 50% of it ($2500). However, this could be offset by my annual bonus, which is paid out in late March. This complicates my timeline further, as I would like to still be employed by then in order to receive the bonus. This also could be offset by a potential relocation bonus paid by companies I am looking at as well as any money we could make selling our home.

Housing considerations: We currently own a house in NC, and in this market, we are confident it would sell quickly. We also have housing that is ready for us whenever we decide to move.

My biggest question is when should I start submitting job applications? In my mind, the perfect scenario is: I submit some apps in late February, hopefully hear back and interview by mid/late March, potentially receive an offer late March/early April, negotiate the offer and get back to them by early April, put in my 2 weeks notice (after receiving my bonus), and ask for my start date to be 2nd week in June due to time needed to sell my house, move, and get married. However, I don't want to pass up on jobs I am seeing posted now just because I think it's too early to start this process.

Does all of this sound reasonable? Is there anything I am not considering? Am I dumb for not applying to jobs I like right now?"

I still live at home and saved about 20k from my summer job, so I’m not facing any financial pressures to accept.

1872,Give my boss a choice?,careerguidance,"The issue: My job involves both web development and production/maintenance.  I'm finding it difficult to meet development goals when I'm being constantly interrupted by production duties, and the switching costs are slowing me down quite a bit.  I can't get a solid block of time to work on anything substantial and our products are starting to suffer because of it. 

I've brought it up to my boss multiple times and he says I can just put off production to work on development if it gets to that point, but the fact is, I can't do that without causing a service failure.  I've asked to have a backup to help support me with production when I'm busy with development and they always say they will train someone, but when the time comes for me to ask for support they are always off on vacation or they are too busy with their own work to help, or they are actually not trained correctly for the task.  I'm complained about this to my boss and he keeps saying he will hire another developer but he never does.

I'm getting very tired of being stressed about code-debt and having to answer to clients about features not getting released on time or errors that keep popping up, when I haven't been given enough time to work on development, yet getting barked at when I take the time I need and production starts slipping.  I have considered looking for another job, but I've been toying with the idea of just letting my boss know, I can either be a full time product manager, developer, or production assistant, not all of those, so he needs to pick one or I'm out.  Do you think that is reasonable?"

I am in early stages of discussing a job offer with a company I worked for ~10 years ago, and I am looking for any tips / things to look out for in this specific situation:

- The two owners are looking to exit their 12 year old company in the next 2-3 years i.e. trade sale or MBO. They’ll likely be retained for a year or two after the sale. 
- I’d join the company to help grow the business by a further 25% over the next two years and take an equity stake in return. I don’t know what the equity stake looks like yet.
- After the two owners have exited, there would be 3-4 of us remaining with an equity stake.

1876,"I hate my job as a hair stylist but it pays well, how can I learn to tolerate it?",careerguidance," I've been working at a chain salon that does quick, low cost haircuts (think Hair Cuttery, Sports Clips, etc.) for a year now. I got the job straight after getting my barbering license. With the amount of tips I make every day in addition to my base pay, its actually very good money. The thing is that I absolutely hate it. Its very corporate and customer-service centered which means customers can pretty much verbally abuse us to any degree they want and we have to just stand there and take it. They can be pretty cruel and sometimes even kinda creepy. As a younger woman, male clients occasionally hit on me and get super weird when I don't reciprocate. Usually this wouldn't bother me, but it makes me very uncomfortable that they know where I work and can just keep coming back. Sometimes it feels like people are purposefully vague or difficult during consultations just so that they can have the satisfaction of complaining about it afterwards, especially older people which are a huge portion of our clients.

It isn't just the customers, though. Its the job itself too. I really thought this would be something I would enjoy or get some degree of satisfaction out of but I just don't. I'm actually pretty good at it too, I just don't find it fulfilling. I've also kind of developed an aversion to the fact that I have to be touching people all the time. I thought this was something I would get over as time went on but it really just kind of got worse, especially in situations where a client is being overly friendly or blatantly flirty. The first thing people typically say when I tell them that I don't like where I work is ""you should go to a higher end place where you get to choose your clients,"" or something to that effect. It's thoughtful advice, but I'm quite confident at this point that no matter where I'm working, I'm not going to enjoy cutting hair.

The reason I want to learn to tolerate this instead of jumping ship and going somewhere else is because this job gives me time to work on my art. I've been an artist my whole life and I'd love to make a living off of it eventually, but I need something to pay the bills until then. This job allows me to work part time and still make enough to stay afloat and put some money aside. I have an Associate's degree, but nothing that would land me in any specialized field so I'm pretty sure this is the best financial situation I could be in at the moment. So essentially what I'm looking for is advice on how to learn to tolerate it because right now, it is definitely not mentally sustainable. I go into work feeling sick with how anxious I am every single shift and I spend most of my free time dreading my next work day. I want so badly to just be able to separate myself from it and be able to relax, but I haven't found any sort of coping mechanism that actually helps.

If anyone here has had a job that they absolutely hated and found some way to learn to tolerate it, I would really, really love to hear how you got there.

Thanks :)

**TL;DR**: Absolutely hate working as a hair stylist but it pays well enough on part time hours to support me while I pursue other opportunities with my art. Trying to find a way to tolerate it so that it doesn't drive me completely insane. Pls help."

Bit of my background - I made a career shift around 2 years ago when I took a couple of classes in SQL and decided I wanted to be a BI/Reporting analyst (those that create reports using the likes of Power BI and Tableau). I didn't have the most extensive education in analytics, so I appreciated it a lot when I landed a job in the US where I was trained on advanced Excel and PowerQuery. Unfortunately due to reasons beyond my control I had to quit and return to my home country and stay here for several months before I try move back to the US (or Canada) before the end of the year. I was lucky enough to get a job here in my home country in a Fortune 500 company but one month in, I now see that the job isn't going to teach me the BI skills that I want to have. The company does use Tableau but I will be only using it to export data from, not to actually build the visualizations. 

Now my dilemma - current company is wonderful and could potentially open opportunities in the future being a global company, but since I have plans to leave for the US by the end of the year, I would like to be equipped with the technical BI skills (or at least some) that I need for my next job when I move countries. Should I stick it out for the time being and learn BI on the side, or find a different job that would train me on BI? I'm aware that there are countless free resources online learning BI but I have to admit I find it way easier to learn on the job or in a classroom setting.

1889,"I have a project engineering job (Job A) going well, and another probable offer (Job B) coming up soon. How can I best play them off each other for a raise or high starting salary?",careerguidance,"To clarify, later on in the post I have a bulleted list of some things I *think* I should try. I’d find input helpful as to in what order I should try these.


I graduated Mechanical Engineering 2020, started working in Kansas in project engineering (Job A) in refining. Started $86k salary.

It has gone well since I started about 1.5 years ago, I have gotten exceptional performance reviews and bonuses. But my raises have been 1% and 3.25% each December, bringing me to about $90k.

I quite frankly have put off asking for a raise directly, and I have clearly “earned my keep” with engineering/design insights saving the company likely $1.5 million.

I have had a friend at another workplace (chemical process plant) trying to convince his own boss and me to get a position there (Job B$. It is looking like I will be getting an offer there in the next week with them increasing headcount with the intent of hiring me.

Since there is no position yet (Job B), the salary is fuzzy. I’d likely be making more than $79k (that’s what my friend — similar background/position made last year).

This brings me to my goal: drive my salary as high as possible for both companies, and using (if helpful) the competitive offers against each other.

This brings me to: In what order should I try these?

• Talk with my boss at Job A explaining why a higher salary is justified. I know they could bump me up to $99k while still calling me a “Project Engineer I”.

• Tell Job B that my salary at Job A is $90k, and that a competitive salary would be there (or I pick something above).

• Tell Job A that I am being recruited by other companies, and they need to consider this when determining if they give me the raise

• Delay talking with Job B about salary until I finish the raise discussion with Job A

• What else should I try/do?"
1890,Should I take this new job opportunity?,careerguidance,"I'm in the last stage of interviews for a job but feeling hesitant on whether I should take it or not if they give me the offer. (even if I don't I think this will be beneficial for future prospects.)

The company I currently work for is a startup but has been around for about 7 years, so they are well established. The team I'm a part of is relatively immature still, I'm in the position to lead and mature the team and process but I prefer to work with an equal or someone more experienced than me to learn from. I currently get paid under 75k, likely to increase this month as part of a year-end increase and I'm sure I can negotiate to at least 80k+ because of the value I have provided and the position I hold.

The company I'm currently interviewing with is 2-3 years old in the same broad industry, they have a mature team even for their relative infancy. leadership I can learn from and it's a more senior role offering 100k-110k (they are open to increasing this if I am a good fit(I believe I'm a great fit and they think so as well).

My concern is mainly that they are a fairly new company and also the risk of taking a new job makes me nervous.

If I get the offer I'm thinking to use it as a negotiating piece with my existing company to see how much they'd offer and depending on that I can also use that with the company I'm interviewing with for an increase (any tips on how to do this would be great). But ultimately not sure about the decision I'd take. I also suck at leaving a job.

Tl'dr company I'm interviewing with offers a higher salary, a good learning environment, maturer team but they're younger than my existing employee who pays less, not as mature, not great for learning but expecting a salary increase this month.

Essentially I am in search of a second stream of income,careerguidance,"I'm in search of a second stream of income and contemplating if I should get another part time job. I am also contemplating on learning a skill like SQL or taking courses to become a Salesforce Administrator but don't want to waste time learning something that won't really be all that useful in reality. My goal is to advance my career and I would like a skillset that would help set me apart and have a better salary. I am leaning towards project management, operations associates, salesforce administrator, but open towards anything for the most part in tech.

Some background: I'm currently working in ""operations"" for a real estate startup company in NYC. I do mainly online work such as board packages, scheduling tours, coordinating the company's social media, and creating internal spreadsheets (like keeping track of our transactions). I step in for walkthroughs and inspections sometimes as well. And I take 3D tours. I currently make about $63k/yr salary including base, commission, and bonus. I am grateful for the flexibility of this job but I feel like I could 100% add more valuable skills to my resume.

Are there any new career paths that could potentially grow in the future that would be worth taking time now to develop skills for? Would appreciate any feedback, advice, or suggestions that anyone might have!"

1898,"I thought I chose a ""safe""/""stable"" career but that has not been my experience at all. How tf can you predict the stability of careers years ahead of time and from the outside?",careerguidance,"I have a masters degree in a clinical healthcare role that has been predicted to have significant future growth for years. I did my research before committing to this. I spoke with people in the field. I nearly memorized the BLS page for the career. I searched for jobs online in my area. However between government policy changes, COVID, and oversaturation.....it's nearly impossible to find salary + benefits in this job. And the salary is nowheres near what was reported both in job postings + averages + speaking to others. 

I'm seriously considering switching fields because of this but I honestly don't know how to avoid falling into the same trap. I thought I did it right. I don't hate the job by any means but I want to live comfortably and am having serious doubts about my prospects on this path right now."
1899,Which One?,careerguidance,"I’ve worked in IT for almost 3 years now. I recently got a job at a new place but am not sure if I should stay or go back (while I still can). What should I do?

OLD PLACE PROS  
 \- Lots of cyber security for clients  
 \- Great coworkers  
 \- Pay: $25/hr  
 \- Overtime after 8hrs and 40hrs  
 \- Vacation: 21 days off (6.5hrs accumulation per paycheck)  
 \- Benefits: Health/life/dental/401k/sick-days/worker protections/etc

OLD PLACE CONS  
 \- 24/7 Medical Center: Requires occasional On-Call (eventually non-stop on-call)  
 \- Lots of manual labor (wire terming/testing, hauling around equipment)  
 \- Lots of driving (two outpatient centers with more on the way)  
 \- No opportunity to work remotely

NEW PLACE PROS  
 \- Work from home 2-3 days a week  
 \- Pay: $30/hr  
 \- Tasks: Not as much physical labor, slightly less involved workload

NEW PLACE CONS  
 \- Not much cyber security for clients  
 \- Long commute to on-site  
 \- No overtime (illegal?) after 8hrs or 40hrs  
 \- Vacation: 10 days per year (no rollover no accumulation)  
 \- Benefits: none (possibly a vague benefits package eventually)

At this point, I feel like it’s a coin-toss. 

I miss my old place, the familiarity, knowing what’s expected of me, etc. But if I LOVED it so much, I wouldn’t have left in the first place. I want to move into a field where I can do more work from home. This is basically impossible with my old job, but more possible with the new one. I'm just worried that's not enough.  


Any advice for this indecisive worry-wart?"
1900,"Been offered a job but have an interview with main choice tomorrow, what to do?",careerguidance,"Hey guys,

Its the age old, I've been offered a job but I have an interview coming up question that I am sure is very common.

I was offered a job Friday evening (Woo!) but the job and company that really interests me is interviewing me in the morning. I have not accepted the first offer yet (I've asked to send on the documentation and contract to review first.) 

Another issue I have is that they want me to start on the 12th of January (In 3 days!). I am currently unemployed so I don't mind starting immediately but I want to make sure I have enough time to deliberate and (hopefully) get a 2nd offer.

So what do you think I should do in this situation? Are start dates negotiable? I don't want to look like I am leading them on but I want to do what's right for me."
1901,How do I leave this job on good terms ?,careerguidance,"Long story short: I took a job located significantly far away from my home. One of the caveats was I promised to move their after my current lease is up. Essentially I work partially remote and partially in person. They were even nice enough to rent me a small place to stay when I come down to work. Now that I’ve been doing it for about 10 months, I’ve decided I just can’t do it. It’s located in a small city and as a young person moving their is just depressing to me. No friends, no family. Nothing. So I come to the realization I just leave. That being said, I love everything about the place I work. The people, the work, my boss. I would like to leave on the best terms possible but fear me breaking my promise would prevent that. Could use any advice on the matter. (Also I don’t want advice about asking my boss about working strictly remote, part of my job requires in person items and it’s not necessarily possible)."

1903,25M here hoping you’re in a friendly mood today. Next career step?,careerguidance,"
I am 25 years old, just finished up working 5 years at a residential concrete company. I’ve worked summers in concrete before, so when I took it up full time around age 20-21 I learned fast. At the end of the 5 years I was micro managing/ managing concrete pour days/ finishing of the concrete while still doing most of the physical labor myself. I can confidentially do any residential home built house to an acceptable manner. 
I recently moved to TN because my girlfriend received residency at a hospital here. I was making a nice $300 a day pay in Ohio &amp; had traded stocks on the side. I learned how to day trade, but unfortunately lost around $100,000 on the market.
I am currently tight on money, but don’t regret my learning experience as I now have beat the Day Trading learning curve. I want to trade stocks in the future, but I now need funding to give it another shot. I don’t want just a “job” that’ll bring me good money with no chance of progression incase I do decide to choose a career path. 
I want a job that is going to pay me well for my expertise &amp; possibly offer an amazing spot in little time with the company 1-2 years. 
Before I did concrete work at age 20-25 I worked a year at a management training program as well. 
Incase stocks don’t work well for me, I’m looking for an entry position or fast track to getting back making $300+ a day as I don’t value myself any less than that. I need this to be a learning job &amp; an advancement for my resume. I really want to be on the $$ side of things. I no longer have the $ to start a concrete company or I would, but that is my mindset &amp; I would absolutely love to own a small residential company one day if it presented itself! Any ideas on the next step for me?
P.s. I don’t feel I’d learn much being a residential superintendent &amp; I definitely have no business playing with a company who just needs me for hard labor."
1904,Should I take the promotion or leave for an external offer?,careerguidance,"I have been in my current role for 2 years operating as a HR coordinator  as part of a team of three which included my manager, myself and one other supporting X country. Three months ago my manager left for better work-life balance as he was finding he was working 12 hour days due to working with the wider team and stakeholders in different countries/time zones (we have been working from home the entire duration of my employment). In November, the team had secured an external candidate who would join as my new manager in January, however this individual withdrew from the process last month leaving us in the lurch with recruitment halted during the Christmas period (as most local businesses close over this time). Over such time, the other individual in my team resigned and I have been performing 100% of my role, as well as elements of my manager and the other individual's responsibilities which has resulted in me being so burnt out from the long hours to the point I end up crying each day after work due to stress. It has been the first time in my career I have sought EAP services. I raised this to a senior member of the wider team out of country who has been supporting me in an interim manager capacity whilst we recruit for a replacement. He asked me to hand some things over to him as he didn't realize the extent of the duties I was performing which was over and above my current role scope and those in similar roles in other countries. 

The culture has changed significantly since I joined the company with a change in upper management.   
I have found myself feeling decisions made are misaligned with my values and the culture continuing on a downhill trajectory.  I have a good relationship with my now ex-manager and previous colleagues who have left and they have all encouraged me to look elsewhere as they have really enjoyed the change since departing. When my manager was still with the company, he was continuously pushing for further salary increases for me given my performance, however this was capped due to the annual merit budget. 

Prior to Christmas, I began applying for a number of external positions to understand my worth in the market as I know I am underpaid for the work I am doing. I have yet to hear back as most businesses in my country close during Christmas and re-open today which is also the day I return to work.

Last week, I received an email from my manager's manager who is the regional Head of HR stating that he was aware I was on leave until Monday, however if I had time to jump on a call before then to please reach out as soon as I was able to. I spoke to him on Friday and he essentially said they've had overwhelming positive feedback from all my key stakeholders and those senior within the wider HR team and whether I was interested in taking my manager's position.  The catch is that this would extend to not only supporting 100% of current country but also supporting 50% of 2nd country, as well as a direct report which would be equivalent to the position I am performing now.  

I am conflicted as I was already planning to leave the company due to the work-life balance, culture and some of the key stakeholders I interact with being very difficult (i.e., not taking responsibility for their areas of accountability) and I'm almost 99% sure that the internal increase will not be paying close to the market rate for an external experienced person in the role.  For example, the salary range for the role being advertised externally would be a 65% - 100% increase on my current salary, however I would expect at minimum a 38% increase although historically I have rarely seen increases upwards of 20%. Other more junior positions at external companies (which might also have a better work culture) are being advertised at ranges of 10% - 38% increases on my current salary and would mean less work stress. 

Another concern is that I don't know when the increase will be implemented until I receive the paperwork and it could be a proposal which effective date of Q2 as they will be slowly transitioning me in Q1. The only thing drawing me to stay is the growth opportunity that comes with this which will look good when I  apply for new roles externally as this is a significant increase in responsibilities.  

Feeling really lost and not sure what to do.  What would you do?"

For context, im 21 and will be graduating with bachelors in business in May. With a combination of inheritance $ and working damn near full time while in school, my net worth is about 125k and no debt.

In addition, I have an interview for an underwriter development program at a well known insurance company which starts at 54k.

There is no room for growth or progression however and while it suited me in my 20s making good money, I realize it is not going to work out going forward. As I want to move and work elsewhere but cannot without further qualifications.

Can I simply go to college and start all over again, or am I just too old for that now. I cant imagine prospective employers would be too impressed with a 33yo showing up out of college.

Have I just made my mistakes and im now stuck with this dead end job in this dead end town ?

Also, if I was to go to college what should I do in order to make real money ? I cant do anything thats going to take years of additional post grad stuff like law or economics or medicine. I dont have time for that. I need a quick 3 or 4 year degree that will set me up with options to make money. I feel like im too old for finance though I do like that subject. I was thinking of Engineering or Computer Science. What do you reckon. What would be a good degree for one last stab at making some money and making it into into a better job with better oppertunities. What would you study in my position ? If anything.

1913,Take a better paying job or stay in current new role because I’ve only accepted it a week ago?,careerguidance,"Need help deciding between career moves (corporate office type): 
I started looking for a new job several months ago, primarily internally. However, I was also contacted by a recruiter for a role which would be a huge step up for me. Long story short, that external opportunity was taking a long time to gain traction. Meanwhile, I was offered an internal position, which I’ve accepted a week ago. It’s a step up for me, but not as much as the external opportunity would have been, and the pay isn’t as high as the external opportunity would have been. I’m supposed to formally start in this new role very soon, but will be in the transition period in the short term. 

However, I’ve also finally heard back from the external role and have a feeling they might make me an offer. If I hadn’t already accepted the current internal role, I would take the external offer without a doubt because of better pay ($40k more than the internal role I’ve accepted). My only problem now is that I would feel like an a$$hole if I tell my current company that I’ve essentially changed my mind, since I’m about to officially start, and most likely by the time the external company makes an offer I’ll be acquainted with everyone in the new role’s organization, etc.

Prior to this, I worked in retail banking for 5 years following 2 years at college (sixth form). 

I don't have a degree.

I'm conscious that I may be stuck where I am as I don't have any additional or external qualifications.  However it really isn't somewhere that is making me very happy anymore. 

My skills include

* clear,  concise and professional written and verbal communication
* experienced problem solving
* financial industry knowledge
* regulatory knowledge and application
* customer service
* Independent and team working
* internal project leading
* analysis and investigation
* negotiation and persuasion

1923,"Negotiating an internal lateral move, but with an added direct report?",careerguidance,"Hi all,

I've been trying to scour the internet for any answers to a similar dilemma to mine but couldn't find any, so would love if anyone had any similar experience to the below:

I work in a large corporation as a project manager, and I've been in this position for about 2 years (was promoted from assistant project manager prior to this role). I'm about to get an offer from a completely different team/division but it'll be the same manager-level, except it's in a completely different function (going from project management to marketing management) and I'll be gaining a direct report (assistant manager level). I've never managed anyone before.

The question is, how should I go about negotiating my salary, given that it's a lateral move BUT with the added direct report thrown in there? Do you think the company will send an offer with an added bump in pay? From what I can see on Glassdoor, my salary is slightly above average in the role I'm in now, so I'm unsure of how much % raise I could expect from the offer. Do you think there's a chance I could negotiate a higher level position, such as a sr. manager, so that I can get into the higher salary range? Have any of you ever been successful in negotiating title level in an internal move?

Would love your input on this! Thank you all!"

1927,Should I quit my job?,careerguidance,"So I'm in a bit of a jam. I got so sick of my current position with my company I put out some feelers (asking competitive pay) not really expecting much back. To my surprise 3 local companies responding back pretty quickly wanting interviews and throwing perks at me. I weighed my options decided between options 1, 2, and 3. 

Option one: same field, different specialty, more mentally stimulating than physically, 9 to 5, terrible pay 

Option two: competitive pay, same area as current job (~15 minutes), not as qualified for job but company is willing to pay for training and working to get me in ASAP as they are new. Potential to move pretty quickly into management with current skills and experience level (this was discussed). 9 to 5

Option three: same exact position I'm in now but different company, competitive pay, further commute (~30 minutes). Physically and mentally demanding, 12 hour shifts like I work now.  

So since they all got up with me about the same two days in a row. I was offered an interview with option 1 decided they weren't worth my time as I would have wasted there's if I didnt pick them plus they did not have enough pros as the others. I'm going to be honest the only reason option 3 is being considered is I'm nervous the second will fall through and I know I could probably slide in easily at option 3. 

Option 2 I've interviewed (on the phone because of the pandemic and we are in a huge surge). The hiring manager called today, saying she just had to clear it with her boss as well as getting another employee hired with me (someone who is also being hired and is certified) so I can be trained. She said I should have my offer letter by tomorrow afternoon and she would call prior with the verbal offer. Though I still have an interview (option 3) scheduled at the end of the week pending an offer letter, as a back up. 

My actual problem is honestly I just want to quit like today (my company is shady will fire you for giving two weeks)and I just rather have 3 or 4 days off to enjoy time and reset before starting a new position. However, I don't know if I should just quit or not. It still doesn't feel like I have a foot to stand on but by all accounts it seems I do. Any advice? 

tl;dr should I quit my job? Have a few offers but nothing concrete. Current job is shady, over worked and clearly underpaid. Potential jobs want me in as soon as this week and as late as next."

1930,Second bachelor’s or master’s?,careerguidance,I’m currently a 4th year Computer Science major with a 3.5 GPA and 2 internships completed(one sports related). I’m thinking about applying to a Master’s in Sport Management but also considering going to a state college to do a BA in Sport Management before applying. Will a 2nd bachelor’s help my chances to enter a top Sport Management program o should I just apply straight away?
1931,Do I stay in teaching or do I go into software development?,careerguidance," I am currently a 3rd year teacher at a public high school in Illinois, and I live in my parent's basement. My current take home is \~40k a year after taxes. I have two bachelor's degrees (computer science and English), and I am halfway through a master's program in computer science.

This is my first salaried career, so I don't really have a frame of reference - but I don't think the amount of stress that I am under is normal.

I don't know how long I can keep living like this. I need independence more than anything right now. I am gay, and my parents are homophobic to a degree. I am missing out on what should be the most pivotal points in one's life, and I feel myself falling into a depression.

Currently, most of my income is going straight towards grad school because my goal is to not take out any student loans. Once I finish the master's, my salary jumps to about \~52k take home after taxes if I stay in teaching.

The other option is to jump into a software development role. I know I can excel in a C#/.NET or Java development job, because I have very strong foundational knowledge, and I have created substantial work for a portfolio - if I choose to create one. Just based off of some research, seems like the pay for these roles as an ""entry level"" applicant can be anywhere from 50k-120k with room to grow.

The issue is that I like teaching. It feels rewarding in a way that I'm not sure I would feel in a software dev role, and I know I am good at it. I have a long-term goal of getting into higher education as an instructor/professor. However, my mental health has been taking a beating between teaching, grad school, having zero independence, (and living in a cold basement). I can stop progressing through my master's degree, and rent a small apartment right now - but pushing through now is the only way I can ever hope to get a decent salary from teaching in the future.

I know it will pay off, but part of me feels absolutely stupid for not jumping ship and getting a software job... I'm not sure what to do. Any insight is appreciated. It would take me 15 years of teaching and finishing my masters to earn what I could be earning tomorrow with my current credentials in software development."

I feel it’s my lifes goal to become a pro but not sure how likely it is, I had my friend say to me come and have a trial at his club, Rochdale dev center you’ll get in, I only went once since my own teams training changed days and I want to stay loyal to my coach as he lets me train with u18 team with which I play the best in, I’ve played 2 games for them and scored in both and I have progressed massively under him. Recently I had a trial at semi pro club curzon ashtons u15 academy however they said the league was pretty much men and even their 6ft giants were struggling and that I was better off staying with the u14 academy as I’m more likely to get scouted for a pro academy.

1934,Is it wrong for me to decline a business trip for several factors?,careerguidance,"I work for a remote/virtual company in the higher education field.

But I look at peers (who are much younger than I) excelling and I just feel so behind (most or all my peers always worked with data or have some great discipline that makes them excel).... Then you got me.... Mr playing catchup. Any tips for the older people that took the chance of trying something different, career wise, and exceeding? How do you stay motivated during moments of discouragement and negative self talk or feeling like you don't belong or not good enough?"

1943,Should I keep working or get my masters degree?,careerguidance,"I graduated about a year ago in mechanical engineering, and have been working for one of Elon’s companies for about a year. I really like the work but the location is horrible and I can’t meet anyone I like or find things to do that I like. I’m considering going back to grad school to get my MS in either mechanical engineering or robotics (as a way to learn new skills which I find interesting). Is it worth going back to grad school at this point?"
1944,Feeling stagnated in career and lacking inspiration. What should I do?,careerguidance,"I have spent nearly 7-8 years in software engineering and feel stagnated already.  I started my career working for a startup where I enjoyed working on new things. Got my first promotion after 2 years working there. After spending 3 years there I felt my resume needed branding and so I switched to a top tech company. Till now I have been doing similar work (full-stack development mostly).

After spending 2 years there I switched jobs when I was about to be promoted. Now I have spent nearly 2 years in this job without any promotion. So, total 5 years without promotion. I always planned to have my own startup but things never worked out and I have lost interest in my work as well (mainly because I hated working for someone else and I was always meant to be means to an end till I start something of my own). This year I was skipped for promotion yet again while those junior to me have been promoted above me or at my level.

I have lost confidence and don't speak up in meetings. I haven't talked to my fellow teammates other than those whom I work directly with (mainly because I was shy already and then been WFH since I joined this new job 2 years ago). Now I don't even feel excited about things. I know switching jobs might not be the solution because it will still be the same with the new employee.

I have 4-5 failed startups software under my belt over the last 8 years. I am good at building applications and equally bad at marketing them. So I have just working code for different product ideas lying around on my GitHub repo. I don't get good product ideas as well. Feels like I will never be able to build a product people really want. I am not sure what to do now.

I want that spark again, and be more interesting, more human, and more creative. I want to be known for my ingenuousness and entrepreneurial mindset than just coding. I like to build stuff, but coding is means to an end to build them. I want to be able to build stuff that people want to use and I can call my own.

I have been trying to learn Machine Learning for the last 2-3 years but give up every time as I can't get around the maths. Blockchain is something I am trying my hands on right now, but I don't want to start with a junior developer again for switching tech, plus my current job doesn't expose me to machine learning or blockchain development. It's plain old full-stack development.

Any advice would be appreciated."

1948,is this job a scam?,careerguidance,"hello, so i was on indeed late night on friday and saw a job posted about a work from home data entry job, interesting thing is, i had to text the number of the recruiter and set up a interview through there. i have had previous recruiters text me about starting jobs before so i didn’t think too much about it. 

then yesterday, the recruiter responded and told me to let him know when i was ready to interview which the whole interview was through text which was strange to me..but he said it was just the company adjusting to technology or whatever. he asked questions about my experience and all that stuff. after that he told me i got the job and they would be sending me a check to buy equipment for the job. 

he told me the 1-week training pay would be $18 something and then after that it would $27.50 an hour. which more than i’ve ever been paid so im like..is this too good to be true? the whole entire interview was conducted through signal messenger. he did send me the website of the company and i checked their social media and stuff and it seemed pretty legit. but im really worried this is a scam considering the whole interview was through text and then he asked for some information so he can add me into their “employee database” which unfortunately i did give him my full name, email, and address (its a family member address not my actual address). how should i go about this? is it normal for companies to interview through text or?"
1949,Should I change careers now or wait a few more years?,careerguidance,"I would like a little insight on changing careers. I am in Ontario, Canada, working as a full-time dental hygienist with 8 yrs experience. I get so much anxiety and dread going to work, and want out of this career. Covid has made this so much worse, and I know that's temporary, but its exposed a lot of things too. I've been at the same office for 8 years (mediocre and on slight decline), but have experience working part-time in other offices (absolutely brutal). There are various reasons I want out, but because this is a finance thread, so I wont whine about those. Ontario hygienists' pay is actually decreasing as the years go by. I will have almost reached my peak in pay, which is 60k/yr, zero benefits and no pension. My partner earns 90k/yr, government job, good work/life balance, benefits+pension with salary growth in future. The biggest dilemma is the timing of this - my partner 30M and I would like to start a family this year (hopefully). We are ""stable"" financially, and are about 5 years away from paying off our mortgage. What has kept me going is the biweekly paycheque and coworker comradery. I'm not sure which career I would want go into, but I would like something a little more stable, less customer facing, with some sort of pension/benefits, and I am ok taking a bit of a pay cut. I keep joking with my partner about letting me know when admin jobs open up at his work, but now I'm even considering that. I used to do hospitality admin work in summers between school semesters and was very good and thoroughly enjoyed it. My diploma is super specific, so I could only do entry level jobs if I didn't go back to school.

Should I stick out the job for a few more years to meet out goal of paying off out mortgage and saving up for starting family? Has anyone changed careers while raising a young family?

Has anyone gone back to school while on maternity leave (ie.online)?

Has anyone changed careers completely in their late 20s, early 30s for something with less pay, but more satisfaction?"

Horseshoeing school is only 8 weeks and around $6,000, while boatbuilding school is at least 1 year and cost around $26,000. There's no accreditation for Horseshoeing school and I would receive a certificate of achievement, whereas boatbuilding school is accredited and I would receive an associates degree. I think boatbuilding would give me skills that I could use in a variety of careers, whereas Horseshoeing is a more singular focus and is more taxing on the body in the long run.

I am an individual with a Finance and Compliance background. I have been working in multiple projects with the HR department, I have a Business Degree and two Master´s Degrees, one in Compliance and another in HR Management. I really enjoy my job when I have to work alongside HR in multiple projects. Additionally, I am taking tons of courses on HR on Linkedin.

For all what I said above, I´d like to find a role in HR. I think my best options are roles such as HRIS, HR Strategy and other ones that do not require a high level of employment law expertise.

&amp;#x200B;

I am based in the UK and unluckily you cannot study CIPD modules individually anymore. If you want to study for the CIPD you have to pay for a full level. Currently, I am not in the HR department and for this reason I do not want to make such investment nor ask my company to do so. 

I have been doing some research on HR certifications and I have found some of them. I´d like to know your opinion on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

aPHRi Associate Professional in Human Resources - International™

They are not very expensive ones so I could afford them.

Do you also know any other to become a HR Business Partner?

Do you know any certifications to break into HRIS? Perhaps, Power BI courses/certifications?

After some months I was able to land a job close to my expectations (salary-wise and task-wise) but the position was not even close to the one which they described during the interview (lets say that my tasks are similar to the one's of a data engineer; I don't degrade the significance of the position, I totally understand its value, but my qualifications are way over-qualified for this and it kinda makes me feel that I wasted my time in academia for nothing).

Hi everyone!

I am graduating in the coming May (Econs &amp; Data Analytics double major from top university) and I am currently torn in between my choices and I would really appreciate any advice from any professionals.

Long story short, I grew up in Singapore so I would really love to work there but due to my nationality being Korean, I am having difficulty getting a job there. I currently have 2 offers:

1. F&amp;B company based in Singapore, they are offering me a ""financial planning and reporting"" position. I do not know what is the pay is like but I'm guessing around $4K/month. I liked my internship there and the culture is good. The company has revenue of $500M, looking to IPO in 3 years and has a small team so I'm guessing I have lots of room to grow.
2. Major Brokerage firm in Korea, they are giving me rotational programme but I interned in ""equity derivative"" department so I'm guessing I'll get a sales role there in the end. I heard from my senior his starting pay was $60\~70K/annum with $20K incentive on a good year. The culture there is quite old and very hierarchical so I don't really like the culture there. In terms of promotion, they have fixed a promotion timeline so not much career acceleration there.

Of course, I will be applying for other positions in the meantime but these are the choices I have. I am confident with my CV I probably can get into most finance positions in Korea (anything except for very prestigious ones like IB) but would love to work in Singapore if I have the choice.

So after the long exposition, my question is: Would option 1 be a good choice relative to option 2 in terms of how career progression? I am not sure how far I can get in corporate finance without any accounting background and the salary growth is a concern as well.

I would really appreciate any form of advice!

Thank you all and wish you a great week"

*and I am a student in the scientific one, but don't think it is full science, in fact the hours of science i study are equal to the language one, and so we were colonized by France for 40 or 30 years i guess, and so does France still making their traces in my country, so we study french more then physics or biology or math even they call it ""Scientific school""*

Should I become a nurse or work in software/coding?

I was on the fence for a long time about which direction I should go. I first thought tech would be a good path. Took some courses and did alright. However, I also thought I should go down a path where I could do the most good. Nursing seemed like a better idea. I switched gears, got a job as a cna at a LTC facility, and began to take courses in biology. Now, after two years and with everything going on with the pandemic and how nurses are treated by admin and the public, I’m not sure if I’ll be happy in the field. I’m having second thoughts. Maybe I should have stuck with tech. I’m half way done with my prerequisites for nursing school. 

Both industries are showing that there will be strong demand for them in the future. I have interests in both and enjoy helping people as well as using and tinkering with tech. I’m older so I don’t have a lot of time to figure out which way will provide the most success for me.

What can you suggest to someone in my situation? Market research was actually my favourite course in college and I was keen to transition into data science or similar domains. Any insights are welcome, thanks!"

1995,Is law still a good field to enter/be a part of for the next several decades?,careerguidance,"For context, I am a high school student and am preparing for decisions related to university/my future career.  
  
I find myself at a dilemma every time I contemplate my future career, as high school courses have so far taught me that I am primarily interested in the humanities, but STEM courses come easier to me. The prioritization of my interests and personality has led me to considering law for my career, but I am worried that the field is not as financially prosperous as it once was, and that the humanities in general will be given less priority than STEM positions in the future.   
  
I am primarily concerned with wasting my time in school. I’ve considered majoring in political science, or travelling to the UK and completing law school directly out of high school, but the more I contemplate my future, the less optimistic I become. I feel as though I’d be setting myself up for failure by not preparing to become an engineer, data scientist, or doctor.  
   
I’m looking for advice, preferably from those who have become lawyers within the last decade or so, on entering the field. I’m also curious to know if any current lawyers regret the path they took with their careers. I’d also be interested in hearing about what non-lawyers have perceived about the field in comparison to their own. General insight into the future of the field would also be helpful. Thanks."
1996,Starting Masters at 25?,careerguidance,"Hi, I’m 23 yo Korean, and I’m planning to go to Czech Republic for my Masters degree. My bachelor is electronic engineering, and I wanna study Informatics in Czech for masters. 

I don’t like life in this country, korea is culturally closed and many other reasons that makes me not want to work here… so that’s why I choose czech. I once studied there and I loved that country. 

My plan is, study Czech language till summer 2023, and enter uni at that time. (Czech univ is free when u have enough language skill. That’s why I chose them. )

However, I’m becoming kinda anxious about my decision. 2023 summer I will be 25, and when I graduate, I gonna be 27 or 28. 

The best plan is, finding a job in Europe, but when I fail, I might have to go back to Korea. But in korea, I have no career or experience, and usually korean companies are sensitive about applicants’ age. 

So worried about my future plans, can anyone give me some advice?"

For Motion Graphics, I have a tiny portfolio and some experience that I will need to revive but overall I have a working experience in the topic.

I would like to know which domain would be better to proceed with considering the ease of obtaining projects and return.

2000,Psych major in HR with passion for data analytics/science but 0 background and network. Any advice please?,careerguidance,"TL;DR - my background has 0 relationship with the field I want to pursue in the long run, and I don't know where to start.

I graduated with a degree in BSc Psychology \~3 years ago with the hopes of attending med school right after. Life happened so I was compelled to have a shift in career so I entered the field of HR instead. I'm currently in an MT for an MNC Shared Services organization. Over time, I've developed a passion for data analytics and visualization, however the exposure I have been receiving has been limited to Excel analytics and a bit of Tableau.

I really want to delve deeper into advanced data work though I'm worried that I have no avenue to apply any potential advanced data knowledge in my current role. Since I work in SS, most of the work in PH is administrative/strategic work and less on the data analytics/visualization. Nonetheless, I still want to learn more of this knowledge and hopefully apply my passion onto something outside of work (possibly a consultancy firm of my own? Freelance data analytics/visualization work? Or a community project geared towards enhancing analytical acumen for the youth in the PH?)

The problem is I don't know where to start. I'm early into my career and have not much capital, no connections/network in the field, and don't have the sufficient finances to fund formal education (I'm taking my MBA right now though I realize the role data plays in this degree is very minimal. I was hoping to get started with freelance work (I learn best through practical application). Any advice?"

The question is : what is needed to study to prepare to be comfortable and confident in interviews ? I don't want to become an expert all at once I just need to crack interviews and get a job in the field and go from there. 

Sample answer :

 take course A and B in Courseera/Udemy and read this book xyz."

The ones I found, I feel as if I won’t pass the interview stage. I was sexually assaulted and brutally beaten during my first semester of college.

So to begin, I was offered a position with them to be a tutor for special needs kids. As new years approaches, I get a message saying that their tutoring program for the school district was pushed back till February. They offered me online tutoring but I didn't get much sessions. Fast forward to this week they offered me a remote tutoring position with a fixed schedule. So far I haven't done anything in the job beside wait for students to sign up for the tutoring. They claim I'm still getting paid for waiting but I'm starting to think they are going to lay off people if not enough students sign up for tutoring. I was offered another job with a different school district but it pays less than what Heytutor is offering. What do you guys think."
2008,How to land Financial Advisor job?,careerguidance,I'm about to graduate this June with a bachelor's in accounting and have been searching for and applying to firms for about 2-3 months now. I'm personally looking for a firm that is independent and isn't required to sell certain products as well as the prioritizing the clients best interest rather than the transaction and was told that small to medium-sized firms are more likely to be independent and focused on the client’s best interest. I've applied to about 5 firms that match my values and have gotten declined from most and have had no interviews. There aren't many more firms that I can find that match my values and am starting to run out of firms to apply to. Was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice that would help?
2009,When Should I Tell My Manager I Want to Switch Careers?,careerguidance,"**Quick context:** I just started a new job \~5 months ago at a company that typically requires employees to wait 12 months before applying for internal roles. Prior to this company, I'd worked in my field (HR) for roughly 3 years.

**Longer context:**

* Even though I enjoy most parts of HR, I'm starting to realize I kind of hate being an HRBP. My struggle here is that I *love* my new company and would be happy if I could contribute in a different role.
* My background is in communications (I have my B.A. and Master's in the field) and both my manager and team have frequently recognized writing as one of my strengths. In an ideal world, I'd transition over to the company's internal communications team.
* Because I work in HR, I clearly understand that asking to transfer before 12 months requires an exception. And, of course, it's never a guarantee because I'd still have to wait for an open role and go through the interview process.
* I mentioned this above, but I'm genuinely worried about my mental health. I show up at work every day on the edge of panic and am essentially living for the weekends these days. I used to enjoy work so this feels out of the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this leads me to my question—**how long do you think I should wait before mentioning to my manager that I've been giving thought to pivoting my career?**

&amp;#x200B;

What worries me the most is that my manager or team may write me off, or not bring me into meaningful work, if I mention it too soon. Not because they are mean, but just because it makes more sense for them to build up the experience of people who want to stay on the team. It could be harmful my career in the event I can't switch or am not chosen for a transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want my manager to feel offended. My company invests a huge amount of time into onboarding and training new people, so I don't want this decision to come across like I was using them or trying to waste anyone's time."

2015,Upcoming meeting with manager and how to get my concern across?,careerguidance,"So I transferred to a new, autonomous role in my old job in the last few months where I have been taking on additional responsibilities beyond my job description according to several of my more aggressive colleagues in this same role. While I’m beyond probation period, it has become a consistent feedback from several of my colleagues that I’m simply “too nice”, too passive, doing things beyond what my expected job duties are and “being taken advantage of.” I’m also more stressed, which I find lacking in my most aggressive colleagues, who reap rewards such as perks of having their own private office granted or equipment bought from management even though we are all at the same employee level. 

Hence, I’ve decided to address this with my manager in a meeting and need to know how? I also want to abandon my “nice” demeanour in the long run so I am more assertive and not merely taken advantage of anymore in this job, because clearly it’s not what wins respect even though my previous department knows me as the “nice” nerdy gal. 
Need advice please."
2016,How can I phrase this interview question?,careerguidance,"A little background, 
I work customer service. I have had horrible luck (or maybe this is standard unfortunately) that every team I am hired into that “wants to provide exceptional customer service” is actually just cleaning up the aftermath of the businesses poor practices. 
I am interviewing this week for a new job but same position and I want to ask “ how much time is spent in this position fielding and managing customer complaints and issues that are due to the practices of this business” but am hoping for a more professional way to say this. 
I’m trying to escape a burning boat and not jump into another in the process 😢"
2017,How do I ‘take a break’ from working due to deteriorating mental health without losing income?,careerguidance,"I think I desperately need to quit my current job due to my mental health being at rock bottom right now. I’m just sooo mentally and physically exhausted of everything because my job is not what I studied for in university and not something I ever thought about doing. Long story short, its like a fresh graduate programme, got interviewed for a job I’m okay with doing, and then the company pretty much scammed me into signing the acceptance letter but later informing me that I’ll be doing a totally different job than what we discussed during the interview. And my mental health has been suffering tremendously since.

The problem is, I’ve been applying to hundreds of jobs that I deemed ‘acceptable’ and would be easy for me to work while I try to recover from my major depression, but I can’t even get a call for interview. Out of hundreds of those applications, I got exactly ZERO calls back. I understand that I might be overqualified for the job but I can see they keep renewing the job advertisement multiple times. Well if they can’t find someone for the job, why would they reject my application? I don’t understand the logic in that"
2018,Should I look for other opportunities?,careerguidance,"I was working a comfortable first job as a fresh grad but decided the position wasn’t what I wanted to pursue long-term and so decided to try for a different company. 

The application was promising — the management was nice to me during my interview, the role seemed exactly what I was looking for, and I thought I would be in a team with a superior. The last part is what I was looking forward to as I didn’t have that in my first job. As a junior, I wanted to learn more from others and wanted a place with more structure and guidance. At my first job, I was the only one who could do what I was doing but sometimes, it became hard and too much on my plate. It also didn’t help that the owners of the company weren’t great leaders. 

This new and current role I’m in is fun and everything I wanted in a job. Although, I have been warned about this company but chose to give the benefit of the doubt. True enough, the management is hard to work with just like my first job. I am being micromanaged and pulled in so many projects all at once with the pressure to deliver good results. The first red flag I experienced was when I was still rendering my last 30 days at my first job but the new company was making me do actual work during those 30 days without being officially employed yet. 

They promised I would have a superior but it’s been 4 months and I’m the only one doing the jobs of what previously was a team of 3 people. I am also being slightly paid less than my first job. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision to leave my first job when the HR and working environment was somewhat healthier and more professional there. 

I’ve been working a lot, sometimes on weekends and holidays too. I don’t have much free time as I used to and my family notices it as well. I can’t stand up to my boss or set boundaries with him because I feel guilty and that I owe him for taking a chance on me. 

I don’t want to leave so soon but the truth is, I’m feeling slowly burned out and my anxiety is creeping back in. With the recent COVID surge, I doubt they’ll be hiring new people and it will continue to just be me for a long time. Should I look for other opportunities or stick it out?"

2028,Change companies after only 4 months?,careerguidance,"Before October 2021, I had been applying to jobs for about a year. Since applying, I’ve been getting a lot of recruiters contacting me for jobs. I actually applied to a Financial Analyst job at Converse in Boston (just for the heck of it to see if I could get in), and the corporate recruiter called me today for an interview.

I’ve been at my current company 4 months and I love it. It’s super laid back and I’m 100% remote. I currently make 71k. Benefits aren’t really good but it’s my first “real” job and I’m only 25, so I don’t really need any health insurance and dental etc... Prior to this I worked in corporate accounting (AP and some senior accountant work) for 2 years while in school and did some real estate analysis, flipping, and project management for my family real estate portfolio. The only way I’ll leave is for at least 90k and still be at-least 80% remote. 2 days in office would be a MAX for me. 

I updated my resume to include my current job and that’s what’s on my application to Converse… plus some other jobs I’ve had. I never put my starting month for my current job so that it didn’t seem as though I was only here for 4 months, I think I just put “Current”. 

What should I say if they ask, why I want to leave or when I actually started? Should I leave so soon? I’ve learned a bit and I could definitely pull off going to another company, but I don’t think I’d be ready for a senior analyst position just yet. FYI, the converse position isn’t a senior position.

I never agreed to anything formally, but have been juggling my job &amp; it's added responsibilites + the manager's job, with no additional promotion.

Two employees missed a shift this week and are coming in on Sunday to make up for it. They require the manager's presence for the task they're looking to accomplish, otherwise there won't be much for them to do.

I worked five 10 hour days already this week, and won't be paid 1.5x for the hours past 40 as I didn't receive pre-approval. I asked my boss if I'd be paid overtime to come in Sunday and supervise these employees, and received no response.

No actual contract is signed by either party. For several reasons, the most practical of which is my longer commute (increased time, gas usage) due to a recent move, and its affect on my being able to manage my responsibilities to my family, which includes adult children with Asperger's and ADHD who don't drive, I have been looking for work closer to home. I was offered a job in my city in a different setting, and I plan to submit my resignation and 30 day notice.

Now I’m at home, trying to find what I want to do. Or what is even possible. I know COVID has opened a lot more remote positions, but it’s still tough with my background because it’s more specific and not in high demand. 

I applied and was accepted to an MBA program for project management, but I don’t want to rack up more debt for no reason. 

My interests are specifically in psychosomatic healing, nutritional healing and neuroscience related topics. I also have a strong science m background.

I’ve looked everywhere for rapid tests, I can’t find one anywhere in store or online. There are some rapid tests available for online order but with price gouging they are more than $100.

At this point I think all I can do is wait for the lab test to come back. I feel strongly this is their fault — I accepted this job back in November and they didn’t tell me until 4 days before I’m scheduled to start that I would need a test.

2039,How to get a job in business or finance without connections?,careerguidance,"I’m a freshman at an Ivy and I’m kind if lost when it comes to my future/career. I thought I might want to do software or stats related work but figured out it’s just not for me. Lately I’ve been leaning more toward a more business related job, maybe IB/finance/PR/entrepreneurship. I’ve always had a passion for entrepreneurship and being money-minded I guess (Shark Tank romanticized my view of starting a business at the age of 8). I’m very hardworking and determined and feel I could succeed in one of these areas. However, I’ve heard repeatedly that “connections” and “networking” are the most important aspects of being successful in these industries. 

Long story short, social interaction isn’t really my strong suit. I’ll never win any popularity contests or be the president of a club. I don’t think I’m rude or socially inept, but I’ve never been particularly well-liked, and I don’t have family who can help me financially or to get a job in any way. 

In college, I have two friends and a few other acquaintances, but that’s about it. I tried to talk to tons of people but the conversation wouldn’t really go beyond surface level and things would kind of drop off.

How do I get internships/job opportunities in finance in the future when I’m kind of incapable of creating a large network?"
2040,Is it bad to leave a job that you recently just started working at?,careerguidance,"I am currently taking a gap year and I plan on starting grad school in the Fall. I got a new job about 2-3 months ago so that I could save up some money and keep myself busy before starting school. At first I was very excited because it was for a position that would look great on my resume and help me advance in my career. However, I am now dreading work and I really want to switch to something else.

The work itself is not too bad, and my co workers are generally nice and understanding people. The issue lies more in how far I have to commute. I have to drive about 45 mins in heavy traffic to get to my office, and another 45 to 50 mins to get back home. Additionally, I feel as if I am being underpaid, as the position requires taking phone calls during odd hours, having to drive over an hour into remote areas of the state, and completing projects under deadlines. I honestly feel like I should be getting paid a bit more for what I am expected to do.

I am pretty unhappy, but I am fearful that leaving the job so soon will look bad on my resume. I really want a lower maintenance job that is closer to where I live. At this point, I am not sure what to do."
2041,Turning 31 and have no idea what to do with my career (and life). What to do?,careerguidance,"As the title suggests, I have no idea what to do with my career, which is slowly destroying other parts of my life because I’m so consumed with trying to find a job that I don’t hate/am even mildly interested in. I’ve never had anything I was passionate about enough to pursue. Hell I don’t even have something that I even sort of like and wouldn’t mind sticking with because I lose interest in things fast. I love learning just for the sake of learning, and have a whole bunch of hobbies, which I like to rotate because I get bored easily. I tried monetizing some of my hobbies as a freelancer before but it didn’t work out. It killed the joy I initially found in them when I started dealing with the business side.

I’ve tried everything to find a direction in my career, from joining meetups, to traveling, to reading, to talking with others, etc. but at the end of the day nothing interests me enough to where I could say “wow that’s so interesting I’d love to spend years pursuing this stuff!”. It’s so bad that I switched my major in college 4 times before settling on one just for the sake of choosing one, not because I saw a future career in it. 

Of course I work to pay the bills, mostly office jobs now. However they’re incredibly soul sucking, boring, and made me hate working with people. I’ve had a few traumatic experiences in the office that now it’s hard to trust anyone at work, which increases my isolation. But it’s one of the few job types that allows me to afford rent and groceries without having to move back home. I always feel dead inside and can’t imagine doing this office shit for the rest of my life. I’m not the type of person who can just “grind” through it. I’m a mediocre worker not because I’m dumb, but because I have zero interest in what I’m doing. If my heart is not in it, neither are my results.

I’ve felt this way with every single job I’ve ever had, and I’ve tried a lot of stuff from retail to education to technology to business. I worked in fields I thought I’d enjoy but that quickly died. I read hundreds of career books that claim to help you find your direction, did a ton of personality assessments, even went to therapy for it, but nothing worked. I’m not interested enough in anything. 

At this point in my life, nothing motivates me except the will to live and making enough money to not be homeless. It’s become difficult to find happiness or even just mild satisfaction in any job or career. I envy people who knew right off the bat what they wanted to pursue in life, or even had a slight idea of where their interests lie. My family is getting worried about me and to be honest so am I. I feel like my life doesn’t have and never had any direction. Of course I want a career I’m actually proud of and I am willing to work, but not like this. 

People always ask “what are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing?”. The truth is, I just enjoy being human. I love living, learning about the world, reading for pleasure and discovering things for myself. I like to have fun by meeting new friends, going on adventures, and trying new foods. How can you categorize that into a career or a college major? Honestly that’s the only thing that gets me “excited”. 

I’m at the point where I’m thinking of going back to grad school (any really), just so I can be back in an environment where I can read and learn again, and actually have a social life once more. It doesn’t feel completely right, but I’m at lost as to what else to do."

2048,How to apply for other jobs when my current job has me working 24/7?,careerguidance,"Hey y’all, I’ve been making posts to Reddit for a while about my job situation.  Essentially I’m underpaid ($80k a year as a senior engineer in Oil &amp; Gas, houston) and overworked (was working 70 hrs a week, boss is upping it to 80-100 since there’s turnover).

Basically, the job doesn’t have any redeeming qualities at this point.  I’ve been killing myself and tanking my health to make things work, but stuff is just continuing to fall apart.  The survival of our business depends on us working 24:7 at a low salary.  

Most of my coworkers have left, and now i want to do the same.  My problem is, I can barely find time to update my resume (much less actually interview) because I’m working 100 hours a week and if I “drop the ball “ and don’t work for half a day projects will fall apart.  I dont want to quit without a job, because I’d I do I will have no leverage and I’m afraid I’d just get lowballed again.

If I’m spread this thin, how would it be possible for me to interview elsewhere?  Does anyone who has been in my situation have any advice?"

I know I may have just been rejected because I'm not a good fit, but I do check every box and have a ton of education and experience that directly relates to the position, so the quick form rejection email riddled with missing information (it doesn't list the job title or the company name - just empty brackets in each paragraph) is kind of disappointing.

When I sent my application in two days ago, the job appeared to disappear and then showed up again. Maybe I just missed it on the list somehow, but it seems that the portal will allow me to apply to the  job again. Is that the norm, or is there any use in applying again with some tweaks to my application? 

I'm not sure if a human saw my application and determined it to be unfit or if it had to do with filters, an out of state address, etc. In the meantime, the job has been showing up and disappearing on LinkedIn over and over. I did see that the person managing the position posted a link to apply a few weeks ago, so it does seem like there is a job available."

2052,Is my degree and experience working against me?,careerguidance,"I was laid off at the end of June 21. I have over 20 years experience in medical billing, coding, and revenue cycle Mgmt. I have more than 10 years experience in Mgmt. Positions (Administrator/Practice Manager). I completed my degree in Organizational Leadership in April 21. I have applied for well over 150 jobs with no luck. On several that I have interviewed for,  I have made contact with the recruiter after not being chosen and asked why, thinking it was maybe something I could work on. The response is always the same, it all comes down to compensation.  They will always say they were impressed but the pay is based on experience and I have 20 yrs. and a degree. They can get someone with much less experience cheaper. I understand part of this landscape has been created by COVID but I have never had this much trouble finding a job.

2059,I need some advice before I decide my career path. Can anyone help me out?,careerguidance," 
Hey everyone. I'm from Bangalore. Basically I'm from lower middle class family. My father naver took care of us. My mother, she is a tailor who worked at garments to fund our education. She is 7th grade drop out. But she wanted us to study at English medium school and that was her dreams and she worked very hard for that. Me and my brother both studied at English medium school only, but i live in banglore outter area which is not main city. Even through i studied at English medium, we never used English to communicate with each others or with our teachers.

After my 10th, i was interested to take science. But my mother said she can afford to pay college fee so i eneded up taking commerce for my 11th and 12th grade.  After 12th, i took Bachelor's degree in commerce field, i had distinction marks in 12th so my college offer me low fee for my degree so i took  B.com even then i wanted to study BBA but no luck for me. After taking up commerce i really fell in love with finance and accounting.

I follow lot of American Content, I watch lot of their movies, shows and read a looooot of their books. So my behaviour has been influenced by that.
During my second year i start a my own company, i even i didn't run the company, i got notice from GST Department and Professional Tax Department. I spent 1 year roaming govt offices and paid fine around 20K to close my GST Registration. That's when I hit into the reality of India. After that i tried lot of business and failed. I had credit card, i used all my money to start different businesses, no one succeed but now I wanted to pay my due. Now I need to give my last semester examination i.e 6th sem, my mom gave my college fee money. I paid my credit card bill. 
After that COVID hit the India, and we have given the option to write exams on 2020 or they'll conduct exams again, i thought to write exams later. 

Now I don't have degree completion certificate and i got NO job. I have applied to 100 of companies, no one sees your resume unless you have degree. I worked at a multiple jobs there i used to earn 12k per month. After that I ended up at collection field. And No exam was conducted in 2020. In that 1 year, my gf broke up with me, and my granny expired. No job. I saw the true reality of life. And where ever I go i can see people's jealousy because I was smart then them. And I'm most of kind heart, at each step of life i see people use me even my close friends will use me to there advantage. Then I took a loan and bought a bike. I needed for travel purpose because no proper bus transportation was there for my village.

After all this, i reaserched career for me. Already I have wasted my 4 years of my life. And I don't have time left to do Indian Courses. I want to make my career in the field finance like investment banking, asset management, hedge fund or private equity. Now I have a little bit of saving, and after 6 months, I'm planning to pursue CMA US (6 months short course), and after 1 or 2 years i ll do CPA US. I really don't have time to do any Indian Courses like CA or ICWA, i really don't want to do course where resulta are not guaranteed and i have my family to take care of and start to earn fast. After completing CPA i ll be 25 years old after getting some work experience i go for my MBA from a well reputed university around the world. 
Is this plan works? Or do I need to consider any other things?

This was my plan, but from past few months somthing is eating me from inside. I'm becoming more like a patriotic things. I'm feeling like if all people fly away from India, it will be like this only. No one will change the things. If very intelligent i may not be able to crack UPSC but i bet i can crack KPSC ( that is state civil servant exam). I can become a good civil servant and make some change in the society. I ll become full of emotions if I see any movies or videos about my nation. Now I'm puzzled between two. 
Sometimes I feel like people don't care about anything here. And if I become civil servant, i need to work under corrupt politicians. DK Ravi an IAS officer death scares me out even today because I have seen their parents from my own eyes how they cried remembering his son.
I have a dream to build a school for a underprivileged children. 

Sometimes I feel like I just live once and i have 1 life, why i should waste it caring for people who don't care much about anything. I just need to travel the world and see the places and if i love it i ll just stay there. Border, countries are fake things built by some fucking politicians. What should I do?? Pls help me."
2060,How to find a job abroad for a year?,careerguidance,I’m looking to move to a different country for a year and hopefully work in the same field I’m in currently which is Human Resources. How do I go about this? I have no particular countries in mind but New Zealand or Europe would be great!
2061,Offer to go back to old company?,careerguidance,"Hopefully this won’t be long, but I’d love some input on a decision I’m about to make.

I made a transition to another company a few months ago (work in corporate FP&amp;A), the company I came from matched the offer of the new company. I still left.

The last company just now came to me offering the title bump I’ve been looking for the last few years (Sr. Analyst to FP&amp;A Manager). Salary and bonus are the same. I’d be going from a 401k match of 3% on a 6% contribution (0.5% per my 1%) to basically no match. Otherwise all things equal. I’ve very much wanted to make the manager title, as I feel it’s important for career progression.

Issue is I left the original company due to workload. They’re elevating my authority and cutting the areas I supported to 2/5 of what it was originally. So by their word my workload would be in line with what I want, just more in depth to the areas I like.

A bit of background: I enjoyed the work I did with the last company far more. I feel like my opinion was more valued than where I’m at currently. Feel like more of a junior role where I’m at currently whereas I’d be more of a decision maker at the last one.

I have the full support of senior leadership (C-suite) of the prior company to come back. Any thoughts on what way I should go? I’d be sacrificing arguably a more lax culture and far better 401k match for arguably better upward mobility (on top of the immediate title change) and likely feeling better about the job I’m doing and influence I have on outcomes.

There is also the resume aspect to consider of leaving a company after a couple months for a better title at my prior company. I already have a couple 1 year stints on my resume that resulted from jumping to higher salaries. Mid twenties age.

2063,What is some advice on getting a job before relocating to a particular city?,careerguidance,"Here's my story, I've spent the last year on a road trip across the united states, mainly in Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington. I want to move out to California, either San Diego or San Francisco. Currently, I've been sitting idle in Arizona while fixing my resume, but now that's all completed and I'm ready to start applying to jobs.

I find myself in a dilemma on which to do first; finding a room/apartment to rent or finding a job first. Most people say to get a job first, which is why I have held back actively searching for apartments, as well as a lot of people looking for roommates/landlords want proof of income which I don't have.

Finding a job before relocating to where you want to go seems to be challenging as well. I can only do phone/Skype style interviews, and I would imagine it would be somewhat of a red flag for employers.

Anyways, I'm just looking for advice on what may be beneficial for my particular situation. Thank you!"

2066,Big multinational corporation or small homely firm ?,careerguidance,"I heard Reddit is the source of good knowledge, so I thought to give it a try. 

I’ve been working for a large multinational firm as a dev (just started my career after graduating) and after a few months one of my connections offered me the same position in another company that I’d say is mid sized. My friend referred me and managed to pull me onboard about a month ago, but what I didn’t tell him is the at I’ve been working both jobs.

I took the offer because I couldn’t not come to a conclusion. Fast forward a month later; I feel like I should leave the small company even though it pays 30% more. I feel like it is the right thing to do as I am in the early stages in my career and I feel like I can get more exposure through a larger company and make more connections. But I’d like to hear your side of things because it feels like a dumb move to chuck 30% more income for something that may not guarantee success. 


Also details about the two company: 

Corporation:
Pros:
Hours 8:30am -4:30 pm 
Lots of free time for L&amp;D 
Often times we are forced to learn or sharpen up skills on assigned trainings.
Potential opportunity to grow by gaining exposure to various projects. 
Project work - which can be interesting
Large reputable company that everyone’s knows ?

Cons:
Feel like I’m treated as a fresher which kinda works in my favour as I’m not expected to tackle hard challenges for now at least.
2 weeks vacation
Pay may not reach to small companies level till maybe 2-3 years. 

Small company: 
Pros:
Hours 12:30pm - 8:30 pm 
Initially feels like lots of time for l&amp;d but no set guidance on what to learn.
Self directed and lots of control over how you approach tasks. 
My friends at a senior position
4 weeks vacation

Cons:
Small team
Work can be enhancements to existing systems which can be boring 
Hours suck basically can’t have a social life after work.

I’ve tried to list everything I could without making it too long.

Also: Did an online course in supply chain and logistics.

Also: Got a job in logistics. Quit after 6 months.

Also me: got a second job in logistics. Quit after 6 months. 

Explored paramedicine (paramedic, nursing etc during the last 2 years) but didn’t work out. 

According to Chinese beliefs (aka my roots) and based on my birth time, date etc (Geomancy), I was told to consider finance and real estate. 

I like crypto, but I know I’m just a consumer-investor who tried and got burned in futures, yet still have a strong conviction for the future of cryptocurrency financially and intellectually. 

Basically: I tried tech. Failed - don’t understand. Logistics. Failed - can’t take the industry. Medical - not deeply interested. Finance - not sure how to start. Crypto - day trading not for me, but buy and hold is fine, but no way for me to make it a career.

2070,"[Texas, USA] How do I properly negotiate a raise?",careerguidance," I work in consulting and my annual review is coming up. I have put in a solid year, been the top performer in my team and I'm working up the courage to ask for a raise.

The reason is I know I'm being underpaid for the amount of work I do. The market value for my current position is 20-40% higher than what I currently make. I also know for a fact that people with the same title within my company are making more.

I had a solid year last year as well and I was promoted this year. My pay was bumped 13% and my title was supposed to change. However, it didn't for at least 6 months due to immigration issues (or at least this is what I've been told. Few others in similar positions had their title changes come through no problem). Due to this delay, I missed out on stock options that were granted based on Title. (Would've made more if my title change went through without delays)

To solidify my position during negotiations, I am also interviewing with other firms so I have offers in hand in case my current employer doesn't play ball.

Now that you have the full context, here is what I need help with:

1. Is it okay to ask for a 27% raise in base pay (This will match what the other people with the same title earn), double the annual bonus, AND the stock options that I missed out on along with what they plan to give this year? --- Or am I aiming too high?
2. If they agree, the change will likely take place in April. As I am currently in mid stages of interviewing with other firms, I plan on not changing firms should I get an offer.  
Also, I'm not 100% confident they will keep their word due to what happened during the last review. Do I tell my manager that I have an offer in hand that I will be turning down to ensure they don't go back on their word?  
Is there any advantage of revealing that I have an offer from another company if they agree to giving me a raise?

If you made it till here, thank you! Please let me know what you think I need to do!"

2076,How to approach 1st salary negotiations as a graduate and veteran?,careerguidance,"Good afternoon everyone who sees this!

I was recruited for a job in the management consulting field in the DC Northern Virginia area. I have never gone through a salary negotiation and the recruiter mentioned the next part of the hiring process will be this. I like to be fair and I know I have hardly any experience doing consulting work. So I do not know how much to ask for. I know the average salary is about 84k a year. Bottom 25th is 60sih and top 25 is 110ish. 

My background: enlisted military (Infantry) five years. Bachelor's degree (top five university) and masters (top five for program).

 I have completed two internships and one fellowship while in university. All research, publishing, or government stuff. 

For work, I did construction, ride share, sold my plasma, and made sandwiches at on point. Im graduating from the Master program this Spring. So, with my limited experience should I be looking at someplace in the middle or bottom 25th percentile? The position is entry level so I am not even thinking about asking for 84k. I am thinking I should keep my negotiation in line with what a GS-9 would make since that is what I qualify for and did an internship at. 

Thoughts?

2077,Extended Probation: What should I do ?,careerguidance,"I recently got hired post-pandemic to work within a growing non-profit. Since working at this organization I have recieved minimal to little training from my manager, who is always busy. She doesn't like when I ask questions and expects me to understand things the first time. Three months into the position my boss snaps and yells at me and tells me I am not doing a good job. Remind you, I'm assuming I'm still on orientation and the workload  for the projects I'm managing is insane. I often stay late just to train/practice myself because I'm in back to back meetings during the day. Which includes the many assigned tasks I have to complete daily. After 90 days she tells me she's putting me on a one month probation. 

I've never been on a work probation before, but putting my best foot forward I attempt to correct my mistakes by improving on her listed performance improvement measures. During this time I make sure I update her 3x a week on my project and CC her in all my emails. During our 1:1's she rarely stays on one subject, jumps from topic to topic, and gives me unclear directions mainly expecting me to read her mind. Did I mention she doesn't like when I ask her questions? So I always leave feeling extremely frustrated. 

After one month she re-evaluates my work again and acknowledges my consistent effort but decides to extend my probation nonetheless. Mainly due to the fact that she believes I cannot work independently, even though I've worked independently in past jobs successfully. And a mistake I made, during this time period which I admitted too. She micromanages me to death, all she does is criticize/scrutinize me, I'm expected to read her mind and make no mistakes. It's come to the point where I don't know what I'm good at anymore...... now I'm being placed on another extended probation 🤦‍♀️. Why not just fire me ???

I took this job because of the field and it's what I want to get my post graduate degree in. But I'm not sure if it's worth it at this point? Also, people here work 40 hr weeks but it seems like everyone at this company puts in 60-70hrs of work. My boss also often send me emails late at night daily. And I overheard HER boss yell at her, idk 😐 it seems like the work culture here. 

I feel like I'm stuck here because I left my last job after a couple of months which I was actually surprisingly excelling in, despite not caring for it and had a positive relationship with my boss. For this current unstreamlined, disorganized, tense environment which glorifies overworking. What should I do ?"

History: I enlisted from California and that is where I plan to return after I leave the military. Before joining I worked in landscaping and I was getting my feet wet in construction. I absolutely loved working with my hands, but that was cut short when I joined the military at the age of 17 where I have been working in the medical field for the past 4 years. 

Present: My heart belongs to computers and electrical powerI.

I have absolutely no IT experience, but I have a Top Secret clearance and I am currently studying to get A+ and Network+ certified before I get out. I also have no experience with electrical work other than readings and videos I have studied on my own time, but I know that there are plenty of resources for veterans to get in the field. 

Goals: I want to hit the ground running and start saving money as soon as I can so an apprenticeship fits right up my alley, but I know the long term effects it can have on the body. With that said, I am planning to slowly use my G.I bill to get a degree while I’m working and try to land a management role somewhere down the line. 
Landing a job in IT seems difficult with no experience, but if I can land a help desk job I plan to go through WGU and get a bachelors in Cybersecurity while I work to gain experience and then I’ll try to go DOD. 

I am posting this to get some advice, guidance, and recommendations. Thank you for your time."

2083,Am I being warned for being too honest by my manager?,careerguidance,"My boss reached out to me at the end of the week after I submitted a self-assessment for the year to clarify why I had ranked my performance in one aspect as meeting most expectations but missing some. I was honest and explained that though I thought I had worked very hard and met most expectations, I felt like there was more that potentially could have been done to be more successful in this goal. 

He thanked me for my honesty, but then also mentioned that sometimes it's possible to be too honest. He then referenced a meeting recently where I told him a team meeting in which I had presented had not gone as well as I had hoped and wanted to get advice from him for potential paths forward to reduce the risk of an unsuccessful meeting like this happening in the future. 

So my questions are: 

- is my manager potentially warning me that I am being too critical and suggesting me to tone it down, as my performance also reflects on him? Potentially warning me that this behavior may have repercussions in the future?

- Or might it be that he is giving helpful advice to lower my too-high expectations and stop being so self-critical and more forgiving?

In both cases, I think I will refrain from sharing anything critical with him in the future, but I would like to obtain some insight into what the potential motivations were for him sharing this with me."

2087,How to write an email asking for an internship/entry-level job?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone! I'm currently in my 3rd semester at Translation uni and hopefully getting in Journalism this year as well. I really want to work in writing but have no professional experience.

I was thinking about sending emails to local journals and tv channels asking for an intership or at least some kind of opportunity to just observe the ambient to get to know how it works and get some clarity in what I can do to grow in my career path. Also to get at least some of the experience and learn a little from people. But I have no idea how to do so.

Should I just send a simple email with my résume? Should I talk about myself and why I want the opportunity?

I'm afraid of being dismissed without even being considered because they aren't publicly looking for people.

Also, I am currently working on my writing portfolio. Should I finish it before sending the emails.
I'm really clueless, please, any kind of help will be appreciated!! ♡

2088,"Trying to break into Product Management, any advice or tips?",careerguidance,"Basically the title, I am trying to find a product management role, as it very closely mirrors (at least I think it does) what I am doing now and there seems to be a lot of crossover. 

For a bit of background, I currently am working as a production lead for a small edtech firm, where I lead and scale teams, liaise and problem solve with client stakeholders, then manage the day-to-day operations until fulfillment. 

The big differences I can see between what I do now and product management as I understand it: product management focuses on the ongoing improvement and calibration of a product long term, whereas in my role we pass the product to the client, and then they own it. While I work with clients to problem solve and get their products to match their vision, I don’t work directly with end users like product managers do.

To give a sense of what I currently build/work on with my teams: interactive courses, multimedia, digital textbooks and blended learning experiences (and occasionally print material).

I'm currently a software engineer, but feel like this field is killing me. Not only is my work incredibly difficult, but it has no inherent meaning. I'm just building stuff that doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things. I feel as if I'm putting so much mental effort and stress into something that brings me no joy or value. I hate sitting at my computer all day staring at code, being in meeting after meeting repeating the same things to different people. It's like I'm trapped on a hamster wheel. It's killing me. 

I feel like I'm trapped because my job provides for my wife and son, but at the same time I'm being sapped of my vitality and happiness. I want to wake up in the morning and feel like what I'm about to do is important and meaningful and will help others. Do such jobs exist? Are there any that don't also come with poverty-level pay?

If I could go back to college, I'd probably study philosophy, social work, or maybe political science. Philosophy because the big questions of life are always on my mind, but I don't have the foundation to struggle with them correctly. I've considered a BSW as well, but I've heard that social workers are underpaid and don't feel like they can ever get enough resources to help their clients/patients. I've also considered law. 

Can anyone offer any suggestions? Has anyone struggled with something similar? If so, did you ever find relief or meaning?

So I have an interesting history of blue collar white collar jobs. The blue collar have a lot of autonomy but limited upward mobility..low on micromanaging. Currently I work at Fedex as a driver started a month ago and honestly I like it. But it isnt enough pay since I have child support to pay etc so I am looking for a flexible remote professional position as well. This helps to.mitigate risk since I dont have all my eggs in one basket in case I was canned or something.  I love fraud and just finished my CFE Ceetified Fraud Examiner certification but jobs usually want experienence in this area. I am just coming back after a 2 year career break where I volunteered...did my certification...took courses..worked on the cenusus..blah blah...

1.  Where do I find positions online that have flexible professional positions so I can keep my Fedex gig?  I can make like 55k to 60k easy doing this and my brain doesnt have to do anything...so I dont want to just give it up if I can avoid it...

2. Should I mention that I am a driver currently at Fedex? U mean to me...being out there working while applying for more professional positions is a good thing..but I worry about companies looking at my resume and saying what the hell is he doing that right now? Maybe I am overthinking it.

2094,How would you proceed in juggling these 3 job offers?,careerguidance,"So this all happened very quickly and simultaneously and I desperately need advice because I keep flip flopping! Any help is so appreciated!!!

I am in the events industry and have a job (job A) that is very demanding in terms of nights and weekends and physical labor. I have been making 45K plus overtime pay. 
A friend recently reached out to me about another position that is out of events and just the project management aspect and it is a remote position (job B). They sent me a job offer for just over 50K  with 4% match for retirement And decent other benefits Even though I will not need to use those in the foreseeable future. I accepted the new job offer but have been having a lot of doubts about being happy in the remote position and leaving the world of events.

Well, I went in to talk to my current boss from job A to resign and he offered me 55K and a bigger responsibility in the events with a sales role which also means a decent bonus. Still I would not have my nights and weekends. Plus there is definitely some toxicity.

Now introducing job C... It is a large accomplished international company and I have been talking to them since before Thanksgiving. There hiring process is very long and drawn out and I made it into the top 4 candidates. I have my final interview with the client this coming Tuesday and will know by next Friday whether or not I get the position. I understand what a gamble all of this is and I am struggling on what to do. I would stay in the events industry with this position. Plus there is a lot of room for upward mobility. Of course there is no guarantee that I will actually end up getting the offer but if I did it will be at least 60K and a 9:00 to 5 weekday working life.

Currently, I have to decide asap if I should keep my job offer with job B - the virtual job- or if I should rescind my acceptance.  I know that is awful but it's just where I'm at. I don't know the monetary value of an increased work life balance, but I also know that I am very underpaid even at 50k ( prior to having kids I was making over 60K) so I feel stuck and know that no matter what I choose, it will be a gamble. If I decide to back out of job B and do not get job C, I will be at job A with more money and more responsibility but no nights and weekends with my family.

But maybe if that happens, the sales position is good for my resume to have for a year and then continue my search?

2095,Could you advise with my career gap situation?,careerguidance,"Hello community,
I prepared for a career in government sector for four years. ( I remained in touch with latest developments in IT with some free courses on youtube) . I worked hard and managed to crack all levels of the recruitment process. But in the end it did not work out due to some administrative reasons when government unexpectedly reduced job vacancies. 
Thinking that I was wasting my time there and due to family circumstances, I decided to take up a job in IT.
I did some trainings and got a job at a startup.
It's been 3 years working here and I want to make a switch for better opportunities.
How do I show this gap of 4 years on my resume?

2096,How are salary employees compensated for working on Stat holidays?,careerguidance,"If you are on Salary and you worked on a Stat holiday,  what was your compensation - 1 day off in lieu? 2 days off in lieu? 

I am in accounting and I have to work a lot of the stat holidays especially when they are in the beginning or end of the month.   My employer give us 1 day off in lieu that has to be taken within the same month.  I am very happy becuase I am missing the time to be with my family, only to be given a day off when everyone's working/in school.  

If an hourly employee works a stat, they would receive regular plus 1.5x for working the stat.  Even if the hourly employee choose to take 1 lieu day, that's still an extra day they are getting paid for but not worked.  So I feel that giving 1 day off in lieu is unfair to salary employees.  

For me, this is not a one off situation, this is every year.  Every year I work at least half of the stat holidays and they expect me to!!   I want to demand proper compensation such as to be paid or receiving 2 lieu days. Am I being unreasonable?   Can they fire me for refusing to work on stat holidays?"

How would you read this situation? I am upset and totally put off by this. Why wouldn’t the position be opened to internal/external candidates at the same time? Feeling like I’m being strung along!"

I am in early stages of discussing a job offer with a company I worked for ~10 years ago, and I am looking for any tips / things to look out for for this specific situation:

- The two owners are looking to exit their 12 year old company in the next 2-3 years i.e. trade sale or MBO. They’ll likely be retained for a year or two after the sale. 
- I’d join the company to help grow the business by a further 25% over the next two years and take an equity stake in return.

I recently interviewed with a competitor and received an offer that pays 35% more than I currently make. When I gave notice my boss asked what they could do to keep me, and I said if they matched the offer I'd stay. Apparently there were many people above him who supported this, they put together a business case, and asked HR to counter. He came back a few days later and said HR needed more time and wouldn't have a counter to me before the end date I gave. I asked how long they needed and he said 3-4 weeks. 

I have flexibility in my start date and can push it out to see what they come back with. But am I right to assume if they really wanted to counter they would expedite it and have something to me sooner than 3-4 weeks? Its a huge company with lots of red tape and bureaucracy, so things do move slow, but I just can't imagine they can't speed things up if needed? Am I better off just cut and running and getting out of there? Or should I humor them and see what happens?"
2102,High paying job(but miserable) or Low paying job(but supposedly dream job)?,careerguidance," 

I'm a 30-year-old male Developer living with my GF with one Cat. Yesterday I got an offer to an entry-level position in a field that I have always dreamed about working on but, this job pays a lot less than my current job(about 30% less) at a well-established financial institution as a Technical Team Leader.

To give some context: I've been thinking about getting out of my job for a long time because it makes me feel awful sometimes. 

Here are some bullet Points:

* The job I perform itself is good enough.
* I dislike my coworkers(Other Team Leaders) because in my opinion have a rotten mentality but I can bear them.
* My subordinates are cool, some of them are my friends.
* This institution is famous for an oppressive work environment but they are making steps into solving that.

For the other Job:

* Small but growing Studio.
* From what I hear is a great work environment.
* The skill set I will be learning is Niche.
* Currently not much room for growth (at least financially).

On top of that, yesterday, when I tried to quit; they tease me with a raise that makes the pay gap even further (about 40%).

So I have a decision to make on Monday. When I think is very stupid to quit and I don't have to make a stupid decision, makes me sad and makes me feel that I will never have that same chance(mainly because of my age).

So have some advice pls?"

I ran out of money and missed my family and friends a little so I came home. I really want to join the peace corps but covid keeps pushing that back. I recently got a job offer in my home town. It would be my first real engineering job.

The job seems like a good opportunity and I'd gain varied experience. The pay is 55,000 which seems good, espescially at 22 years old. The man I'd work for is also friendly and it seems like a good work environment. It seems like it might be kind of fun too.

The only problem is that I dont feel ready to settle down. I want to travel more and get some kind of crazy job abroad. I figured I'd do this job for a while to save up some money and gain experience and then go back to travelling after about a year or so.

But the guy I am going to work for keeps talking about stuff way in the future like stuff I'd do over the next 4 to 7 years. He is talking about me like I am a long term investment before I even start the job. I just don't know that I want to stay in one place that long right now. And we would be the only 2 engineers working there so me leaving might be a big deal.

I have had an active application for peace corps for about a year. I had a great interview but the program keeps getting pushed back because of covid and I have no idea when and if I will get to go. If I get into that I think I'd quit this job to go do that.

Peace corps is a 2.5 year program and I'd like to save up money and spend some time with my family and friends before I go so taking this job would fulfill both of those things.

Would it be wise to take this job? Is it dishonest of me to take a job where the boss wants to invest in me and keep me for a while but deep down I know I may not stay long."

Some of my previous designations include IT Manager, Network Manager, Solutions Architect, Cloud Architect.

Over the years I have gained knowledge in multiple vendor technologies and have the certifications in each. This makes me highly desirable in the country I reside especially where there is a shortage of skilled people with as many years of experience as I.

2125,How can I negotiate my salary for a promotion at my current company?,careerguidance,"I am a 25 y.o. living and working in NYC have been at my current company for almost 2 years to the day. I got offered a promotion to go from Sales Specialist to Associate Manager, Trade Marketing. Although I really want the job, the salary was not what I was expecting especially since I will be going from a 25% annual bonus to 10% and losing my free company car that had all expenses paid. 

For reference: 

* Current role: $97,125 total cash compensation ($78k salary + 25% bonus) 
   * Car value (approx.) per year: $8,500
   * Total cash compensation + car value: $105,625
* Promotion Offer: $95,425 total cash compensation ($87k salary + 10% bonus) 
   * No car
   * Career path I want to pursue
   * Remote working  

Fortunately, my boss and I have a decent relationship that I could ask him questions directly. He said it is typical for a 7-10% salary increase going from specialist to associate manager at our company. He also said I deserve to be compensated for the loss of benefits moving from my current role to the next.

Additionally, the national average salary for an Associate Trade Marketing Manager is $104,918 (according to Glassdoor). 

I feel like if this was an external hire, they would have had a salary closer to the national average salary but because I am internal they went based off of my current salary to determine my new one.

I have gleaned that my department probably couldn’t function without me with the amount I cover and limited resources on the team. I know that and my boss knows that.

I like my company but can’t go on like this. At yearly review next month I plan to demand (for lack of a better word) for a raise or direct reports. If not I’ll go elsewhere.

2132,A possible scam ?,careerguidance,"Hi,
I've recently started working in a company I don't fully believe in. I think they are into something bad behind the door
Can you guys help me identify? I have been listening to their conversations and did my own research the very first day. Pointers as follows:
.
.
.
1. The Name scandal:
I searched for the co online before joining just like anyone would do. They, Let's say, ABC pvt ltd don't have any office in our country by that name but abroad and that is it! It's some
other cos name abroad which has no relation to this co here (So can you use same name ?)
What more intriguing about it is df name for df place
on offer letter/appointment letter/NDA: ""ABC security pvt ltd.""
on office building, social handle like twitter, Free Local Company Directory/: ""some full form of ABC + global corporate pvt ltd.""
ALSO CIN no. from NDA &amp; Company directory doesn't match even though registered office address is same which is strangly, residential address.

2. Social media hoax:
According to NDA - 
a. Current &amp; ex-emp of co, must remove cos name &amp; it's subsidiaries from their LinkedIn connections, twitter, FB friend list etc.
b. must not mention cos name in any social media profile &amp; job portals. If resume is posted on ""job portal names"", then they must remove cos name from it.
Asked HR if I can share ""Started working at ABC""  on FB but she gave me a different name to share on social media.
c. must not post regarding location of official tours, checkins by posting stories on sm apps etc.
They have lied on their twitter about their
Establishment year..and they have joined Twitter in 2019  (huge gap in establishing business date and joining twitter)

3. Extensive Background check :
I have worked for a very reputable NGO before and their bg check was okay but then this co made sure I suffer through the process. Took a dozen contacts to do bg check and on the top of that previous employeers verified. That's understandable as HR was outsourced. After I was selected I was supposed to go to THE office from where I was redirected to other office I am currently working in on the date of joining.

4. Office practices.
They are Not using paid softwares but
Using free licence or product keys.
gateway of foreign country, vpn used. 
While setting up OS, time zone of different country. Username not mine but some random foreign name. Have to submit the dairies they provided for note-making before punching out. Notice board seems to emphasize more on meeting in person than messages and maintaining as less hard notes as possible. minimal or no soft copies.
Says their customers are from ""Country name"" and government therefore security is paramount
Words I overheard : Server Vendor, Send system, protect ur identity use df name df location, keep changing on location
location can only be from europe not usa
 
Creating fake mails with wrong details name, address, ph no. and purchasing servers, domains, ssls through these mails and bitcoin. All this to be done through VirtualMachine
.
more to this but there were a lot of things I can't recall/grasp.
.
.
DISCLAIMER* : have never worked in an IT industry before
So it might be biased from a non IT perspective.
If someone from Securoty and IT shed some light on these practices, please do so. Most of these are understandable given It's an IT security co"
2133,"Looking to leave teaching, but I'm not sure about what options I have. What types of jobs could I be looking for or working towards?",careerguidance,"Hi all and I apologize if this is a repeat question. I have taught high school for 5 years, with a 2 year break in the middle where I worked in restaurants. I am looking to change careers because I don't think I'm well-suited for public education. The problem is, if I sit down to search for jobs, I feel like I don't even know what I'm looking for. I'm also open to starting work on a professional certification, but again, I don't know where to begin, or what a realistic timeline would be to qualify for another line of work. Any advice is appreciated, but I'd mainly like to ask:

1. What job titles could I be looking into as a person with decent general work experience, good references, but no specific skills or experience outside of teaching and customer service?

2. What are some professional certifications I could look into, and what is the time-frame I should expect to earn these in?"
2134,Did I make a pretty bad mistake when it comes to my job search?,careerguidance,"Basically, I was new out of college and always thought that a job title related very closely to what someone would be doing at work. For example, if a job title said ""Business Analyst"" I pretty much automatically assumed that the person wouldn't be doing any tasks related to project management. My idea was that a project manager would do that.

Basically what happened to me is I saw a job with the description ""Solutions Engineer Digital Analyst"". Then I kind of skimmed through the description a bit. It listed about 20 different responsibilities. For example, testing, analyzing data, Software Development, talking to customers"". So what I assumed was ""this looks like a job where I would be doing lots of different tasks. That sounds good to me. That's what I want"".

So I got the job and the first day I go there my manager tells me ""You are a Software Developer. Your job is Software Development"".  So in my head I was thinking ""well why wasn't the title Software Developer then?"".

Long story short, about a year goes by and my manager acts upset with me pretty much everyday because I struggle with coding projects imvolving thousands of lines of code that are given to me.

One of my coworkers who joined after me also said he thought the same thing as me. So at least I wasn't alone I suppose. He kept saying ""I don't understand why they don't put the title of this job as Software Developer""."

2140,How long should I wait before quiting a new job?,careerguidance,"I just signed a contract with a certain marketing company yesterday as a virtual sales rep of a line of cooking ware/cutlery.

Manager seems like a genuinely nice guy, really positive. I had 2 days of unpaid group training, each lasting roughly 6 hours, I was asked to e-sign the contract at the beginning of the second day. It was only after that that they showed a full demonstration of what I would be doing, and it seems I need to be a lot more pushy than I was originally led to believe. Their pushing for me to give them contacts at the end of training for potential recruitment was also vey off-putting. I was initally told that not making a sale is fine since I would still get my base pay per appointment. I had to contact friends/family to get demonstrations booked and that it would simply be for practice, but I'm feeling like they're being too pushy in trying to get me to make sales for my ""first promotion.""

I'm fine with talking to people, but I'm starting to feel like I would be a very poor choice for this role. I'm starting to feel like I just signed up for a big scam.

So how long should I be willing to stay with them before calling it quits?"
2141,How to communicate that your coworker has no enough competency to do the work?,careerguidance,"I'm trying to help my coworker, but their lack of basic knowledge and technical principles makes the dynamic very exhausting."
2142,Time to pivot?,careerguidance,"I’ve been at the same job for over 10 years. Through trust and hard work, I managed to make it grow from an admin assistant role to one with more responsibility. It’s been incredibly rewarding, I really like my boss and their philosophy. The opportunities are different every day and require a lot of dexterity and creativity. The pay for the last few years has been good and allowed me to provide for my family. My work experience has been very informed by the 2008/2009 crash. I took a job out of college at $12 an hour and was told I was lucky to have it, so I’ve been kneecapped in pay and opportunities where I work.

The downside: the hours are constant, I never get to not think about my work. I still have to do all the admin work in addition to all the extra new opportunities, which I get is part of growth/making more money. The job requires dealing with difficult personalities on all fronts, but some of them are outright disrespectful and make it a point to still treat me like an admin assistant despite knowing my expanded role (it’s truly a title issue here- as my title still says “assistant” despite other connotations). 

I’ve been doing this for over a decade, I really like it. But I’ve reached a breaking point- some of my colleagues are incredibly passive aggressive and make it a point exclude me from projects because my portion of the work requires them to include me when they have to work with our boss. I’ve talked to them about it and they just get more hostile. Before I could brush it off but it’s worn me down. I’m miserable and it’s impacting my attitude at work despite my best efforts. 

I met with a colleague who works in industry. They offered me a job on the spot with the opportunity to be partner track (getting clients is something I would love to do but don’t know how). It fits my skill set, sounds like it has better hours (anything is better than what I have now), and is a much more “blunt” workplace, which is what I prefer. We are sorting out pay and what a possible onboarding plan looks like. It is ideal in so many ways. But I am nervous. I’ve done the same thing for over a decade. This is new and very out of my comfort zone. I also want to have a kid soon (already been there, done that so I know how I’ll handle it), so all this change is freaking me out. 

I feel like if I don’t take this opportunity I’m just going to continue to endure, which doesn’t sound like a great career move. So do I jump ship and try this new job? Do I warn the new employer that I want to have another kid and that they don’t need to worry about my reliability or leave that out? 

Or do I just suck it up and stick with what I know because I am good at it? What pitfalls am I not thinking about? Thank you for any and all advice."

2144,Should I leave my apprenticeship to go to college ?,careerguidance,"Im a forst year apprentice. Because of covid, I have been stuck in 1st year for  years. I am absolutely bored, not so much of the job, but of being stuck in a tiny rural town. I want to travel and be somewhere new. I feel like my interests have changed slightly and I want more than what this apprenticeship has to offer. Everybody who is a tradesman around here just gets overweight and drinks and there is a large cultural aspect to being a tradesman here. A culture I want no part of. I dont want to be 50 and fat driving around in a van out here in the middle of nowhere. I feel like I have to escape now while im still young. 

Should I just quut the apprenticeship and seek better oppertunities through college ? Or grind it out for another  years and maybe leave here when im qualified. I have already applied for engineering and also computer science so I can attend one of those in September. Im just worried because I have no idea if its a mistake or not. I know im not happy here thats for sure. But is uprooting everything and leaving for college going to change anything or should I just accept this is the way that it is and continue to grind it out here putting up lights on old farms covered in shit and getting fat and breaking my back"
2145,Job prospects in transport planning in Europe? What about alternative careers?,careerguidance," I (29F) have an MEng in Civil Engineering from a University in Europe, and now I'm pursuing a PhD in transport planning in a UK university. At some point next year, I will complete my PhD (it will have taken me 5 years in total) and alongside that, from September I will start working full-time as a graduate transport planner in a multinational company in the UK (already accepted a job offer). I really like this field, and through my PhD I have had the opportunity to learn new skills, such as conducting novel research, basic programming skills and performing data analysis in GIS and R.

However, I have a few concerns about my chosen career path. Firstly, after 5 years in the UK, I decided that I do not plan to live here forever (for various reasons), and would ideally stay for 2-3 more years to gain some experience and then move to another country (maybe even my home-country in southern Europe). Although there are many transport planning jobs here, I do not know what the job market in Europe is. I feel a bit worried that after starting building a career/expertise in this field, I will have a very hard time continuing that in another European country. Secondly, I am not sure if corporate jobs are for me at all. I really like feeling that my knowledge and skills progress but am not interested in company politics etc and generally I'm not a big fan of multinational companies.

I guess, my main concerns are: 1. Are the skills I mentioned flexible and will they allow me to consider other job markets as well, and if so, then which ones? 2. Is there any demand for transport planners in Europe, and if not, what about civil engineers? 3. Any other alternatives to working for multinational companies? I suppose I could consider staying in academia, but it's a very very competitive field and I do not want to find my first permanent academic job in my late 30s/early 40s.

Thanks in advance for any advice/ideas!"

2147,How to Negotiate Promotion Salary?,careerguidance,"Hi, everyone! I was recently promoted into a new position at my agency and was offered what I feel to be a disappointing raise. I received a glowing formal review with no negative feedback and was told that I was a highly valued asset to my team. My raise was 25%, but I know that others in my agency who were also promoted to the same level are making $8k-$10k more than what I was offered.  

I thought I would be given the opportunity to discuss pay via email, but it was relayed to me during my formal review by my supervisors who don't handle pay negotiations.  

Given my review and apparent importance to my team, I feel completely insulted and want to ask for a pay adjustment. I know that my work warrants more than what is offered and don't want to bring up the pay of my coworkers, but am unsure about how to go about this when the increase was 25%. 

For reference, I started with the last person to get promoted to this level with the same experience and same pay and have since discovered their pay is 10k more. Does anyone have advice on how to go about this in a delicate and professional manner? I like my agency and don't want to leave, but I truly do so much for my team and feel insulted.

2152,How do you transition your career?,careerguidance,"Hey career guidance community,

I am currently unsure about my career path and the possibilities that are before me so want to get some help reflecting so I came here.

I am working in a large internationally known architecture firm and have in only three years of working grown into an important role within that firm (it is my first job and i am the youngest person with this title in the firm). I have done this by being mainly people-oriented and making sure the top performers in my team can perform well giving them as many opportunities as I possibly can and including them whenever they want as well as sticking out my neck for them/shielding them from upper management. In return, they aren't reluctant to put in their best efforts making all the projects I have worked on quite successful.

When I reflect I don't think my skills are so much in the field of architecture (even though its fun to do) but in the leading of high-performance teams to successful targets.

The architecture field is notoriously overcrowded and underpaid so after growing so fast and carrying a lot of responsibility it doesn't really result in any serious financial changes for me. (earning 3200e a month leading multiple international projects with teams of 3-15 people) Future prospects are also quite slim the architecture salary only grows up to about 5500e per month in the netherlands.

I love working with people and in high-pressure and complex situations but I want to also earn money that reflects the amount of work I put in.

Do you have any thoughts about this? Have you ever transitioned from work field? Is there a work field that I can transition into that could use my skillset?

I am extremely interested to hear your thougths :)"

2160,Salary vs experience for first full time job as a UX designer after graduation. Which is more important?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone,

I am doing some soul searching right now regarding my first full time job in the field after graduating in my masters degree. In terms of skills, I see myself as a generalist, who is kinda a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" type and likes to participate in all activities in the human-centered design process including user research/context of use description, concept development/prototyping and evaluation through user testing. I have done two internships (in different domains though). Two potential directions for perspectives emerged based on the jobs I am applying and interviewing for right now.

Big consultancy -&gt; higher salary, but ""dynamic"" working hours depending on the project and its stagewould mainly operate as the only UX specialist in an interdisciplinary teamthere is an internal community with other UX professionals where I can participate for exchange, but would not have assigned UX mentor

Agency -&gt; lower salary, but would work with many Senior UX professionals from whom I would probably learn a lot, there would someone like a mentor who supervises my progress and to whom I can bounce my ideas towould also have some junior ""armor"" in the beginning before I tackle tasks with more responsibilityI think the work life balance is kinda similar, maybe little faster paced

My question is if I should go the first consulting path for the better pay with my existing experience and grow and catch up missing knowledge through self-study/community and meanwhile ""faking"" the rest OR take a financial step back for the first several years and go for an agency to grow my skills through working close with more experienced colleagues on the job. I like the challenge in the first option, but definitely see the upsides in the second when its comes to build a more solid skill set.

Thanks in advance. Sorry for long post, but I wanted to provide enough context in hope to get more fruitful feedback."

2164,is switching from shipping to trade finance to big a jump?,careerguidance,"Hello all, I'm here to seek some advice and opinions.

I've always been interested macroeconomics which I believe stems from an irrational fear of waking up one day to find my money in the bank turned into banana money ie. being worthless.

Known as banana money, the Japanese currency during the Japanese Occupation became worthless due to runaway inflation which was coupled with blackmarket practices.

Unfortunately circumstances brought me into engineering / shipbuilding where I stayed on for a good 6 years due to promises of career progression and was on track for a mid managerial / project manager position by 28. Then the oil crisis struck and I made a switch upstream towards the biggest container shipping company - still much in line with my aspirations being linked with globalisation and literally moving goods around the world.

However I find the compensation while decent, doesn't really allow me to explore what I am interested in. A move towards trade is also hard.

Hence I am applying a position into trade finance and recently am studying for the CTFP final exam qualification. Hopefully a part time degree in future if time permits.

What I would like to know is if you guys from finance or anywhere think this is a good move or not from a lost soul still trying to identify himself at 32 years old."

My current work is related to the field (somehow, it’s mostly writing finance and blockchain articles + managing social media accounts) but I hate it. I’ve realized my goal in life is not making a lot of money, but helping people. A year in this field and I already don’t like the mindset, don’t like how money is everything. My dream was to work for a NGO in some economic development program, but I realize how hard that is

Then the second career I have in mind is nursing. I would be helping people, it’s less tedious, and overall I feel good when I think about being a nurse. The thing, my country is your average third-world country, nurses are VERY underpaid. I’d have to rely on doing a master’s program or finding a job abroad. 

With economics, it’s better paid here, and my plan is also doing a master’s programs. I could try find something full-filling, and if I can’t, just study nursing for free in Europe (Since I have an EU passport) and stay there. I don’t want to make six-digits per year, I just want to be happy.

I have maybe around 1-2 years of work experience and it’s mostly physical labor and half the jobs I can’t list cuz I left in a week or got fired (I was very immature). I also have zero internship experience or entry level experience.

And the worst part of it all is that I’m old. I’m 27 and I wasted my 20s doing nothing to better myself. Mind u I have been applying a lot over the past year and a half but I’ve worked little during this time (mainly cuz of covid).

After hundreds of applications to internships and entry level jobs in all of these fields, I’ve pretty much gotten zero interviews except for like unpaid internships. Do u think unpaid internships would be worth doing?

Right now I’m gonna be doing customer service type jobs or maybe sales. Does anyone here know if customer service experience or sales would be useful for getting into entry level jobs with a Communication degree? Should I get certificates?

2184,Can you give me an idea of any jobs that I might enjoy?,careerguidance,"I'm a 25-year-old male in Austin, Texas. I spent most of 2021 floundering in the job market after being laid off after 5 years from a major specialty retailer. I dropped out of college in 2016 due to family issues and then spent a while serving coffee until I found work at said specialty retailer, doing sales then getting into leadership in customer service. 

In 2020, I started looking into my mental health along with seeing a psychologist. I've always known I had ADHD, but I was not aware that I was bipolar. That diagnosis really changed my outlook on life and I'm trying to do better. I've realized I want to find a better job. Something I can be fulfilled by. I know being happy at work is hard to shoot for, but I believe it can happen. I just don't know enough about what opportunities are out there. 

Some of the things I've come to find I enjoy most at work are helping people, having a good conversation, making someone's day or even life better, and doing honest and truthful work. (This may seem odd, but I've seen a lot of scummy sales tactics used which left a bad taste in my mouth.) I am unwilling to travel though, as I'd like to be there for my future family as often as possible. I don't have many other restrictions though. I'm willing and able to go back to school currently and am open to the idea of getting a degree for a job. 

I've thought about being a teacher, but I don't want to commit to going back to school for that without feeling like I know what all my choices are.

Any suggestions or tips or appreciated!"

2186,How do I switch jobs or make things better at my current job?,careerguidance,"I am a User Experience Designers. I had a solid 7 years of experience when I joined my current company in late 2018. They were paying way better than the others and it is a very well know company. When I join, I did not have any ownership of any product/work. So I took some time to build a UI kit for my fellow designers. This was supposed to be a small personal project that my team can benefit from. This became a huge thing in my team and department. Over time this became my primary project. To explain this to non-designers, this is crucial work but this does not demand my full bandwidth. Essentially I kept doing small support work for lead designers for 2 years. I was frustrated inside. In 2020 my manager offered me a promotion and more responsibility for design system work which I do not enjoy doing. I straight away said no to her, got myself kicked from the team, but surprisingly got a promotion because apparently, I had done good work.

The feedback that I got, is that I am not a team player and do not focus on my team's needs. Probably that is true, I suck at teamwork. At the same time, I am a designer, I like finding problems and solving them. In retrospection, I lost my team, and my manager could not use me where she needed me the most. At the same time, I feel frustrated that I am not creating something new.

In my current team, I still maintain that same UI Kit and support my manager on a few tasks that I feel are trivial. I have got some serious hikes over the past few years and my current salary is at the top of the line, which has become a problem for me to switch jobs. I feel stuck at my current work. I tried to take initiative to create opportunities for myself in my current team but nothing worked out.

I have already expressed the kind of work I want to do to my manager and I am trying my best to prove myself as a team player by offering help and asking for work when I have the bandwidth. Thinks are looking grim and I am losing motivation."

2192,"Career change advice with no education, is IT the sole option ?",careerguidance,"Hi all! 
A little background check about me is that i’ll be turning 27 this year… 
I’ve been in hospitality all my life and am currently bartending.
I’m also based in Sydney Australia if that helps. 

Although i do love bartending i don’t see it as something i can do my whole life especially as my partner hates that i work nights. 

I was leaning towards something like IT ( i can’t think of anything else that may potentially be as high rewarding financially) but it would take me 1-2 years atleast to transition after getting a few certificates and study in the industry. 

So my question was to ask if there were any other choices that were adequate for someone like myself who is uneducated in any field to jump into for a career change and try transition my life. 

As i get older i feel as if i’m late already and even though i make crumbs from bartending, i don’t see it long term. 

Any career/ life advice is very welcome as this topic of life change and crisis has been stressing me out whenever i think about it …."

No formal paperwork about the event. So do I consider this a threat to my job or just her frustrated?",careerguidance,"
So I’ve had extensive manager experience before, went to college got a bachelors degree and went entry level in another field. For our relatively small facility it’s only me as my boss in our department. Yes I’m new to this, yes I’ve never been in the industry even the facility itself is in. I’ve still acted professional and shown up on time, completed my tasks and asked plenty of questions. The issue is my boss doesn’t seem to like questions. She tells me to ask as many as I want but always seemed upset I ask so many of annoyed that I don’t know the answer already. So I took initiative to solve an issue on my own that’s under my job description and messed up. I own that and didn’t hide it, it wasn’t earth shattering and was easily fixable. However she sat me down and essentially said she didn’t think the job was for me and how she needs to see improvement or it won’t work out etc. I guess what bothers me the most revolves around the fact I’ve literally been here a month and am essentially cut loose at this point with no further training. Okay my job is handling many aspects at once as she says all the time, that also means I should have extensive exposure to all those moving parts before I’m cut loose. This isn’t just the trade I’m in but the facility which has its own web of instructions etc. 

First off I feel like I really did nothing close to warranting that conversation, secondly I just feel like this isn’t a conversation to have at 30 days in. I’m new, new people slip up. That’s why probation periods are often 6 months. I’ve never had such a hands off training. Expressing this I know would bring more ire. The truth is I am getting better and the position is self sufficient enough my boss doesn’t bother me being witchy as I can just ignore her bad attitude, I’m just worried she fire me before that.How should I approach the situation? She’s been very nice the day after and was telling others how she had a very bad day yesterday, I just am even wondering if I should take what she said to heart as a threat to me job or just her venting. She gets easily frustrated and upset at people I think my issue is I’m her only direct report. I just feel like if my job was truly on the line she would have had to make me sign one of those improvement plan sheets (which I’ve seen others have to do in different departments so I know the company uses them) rather than just say ‘this isn’t for you’ snottily."

2200,How to learn how to become a generous manager?,careerguidance,"I've been an individual contributor with a zero-sum mindset for a while now. However, now I've been put in a management position and I realize that this mindset really won't work anymore.

2201,"Trying to get out of in-person customer service, and into something work from home, is this a good idea, and where should I start to look, if so? (Read post for context/details.)",careerguidance,"TL;DR: I just got hired at a casino theoretically making significantly more than my previous job, but with COVID cases rising again, the possibility of getting denied the required permits due to failing a financial background check, and being entirely dependent on someone else who may or may not share a schedule with me for transportation, I'm rethinking this job a little. Is it a good idea to keep searching for a job after getting this one, or should I stay put for a little bit? If I do keep looking for remote work, where should I start?

So, I've just been hired on at a Casino as a cashier. This is a major step forward from retail/restaurants in terms of schedule, and benefits. I haven't started officially, and while I'm planning on keeping it in my back pocket, I'm beginning to rethink this job. I'm dealing with drunk people with major f-you money who come to the casino to spend more money than I see in a year's worth of wages. Multiple people working there have already tested positive for COVID, including the supervisor who referred me, and in-person work conflicts with where I want to be in life as well. In addition, I'm commuting an hour or so as it stands, and I'm entirely dependent on my roommate (Who also works at the casino, not the supervisor) for transportation, as I lack a car.

This is all not mentioning that I could have my job taken away if the background checks come back with red flags. (I have a couple accounts in collections from the latest period of unemployment/some unexpected medical expenses that I couldn't afford. Any bank or job where I deal with a high amount of cash could very well let me go for having accounts in collections as it makes me a theft risk.)

I'm considering trying to find something work from home, but have no idea where to start or if it's even a good idea. Indeed.com was basically chock full of very similar shady sales position ads that were full of red flags, and I'm not actually sure where to find legitimate listings. I'm, again, also not sure if it's a good idea. The Casino does pay okay-ish, with okay benefits, but I can't help but feel that I can still do slightly or even significantly better, especially as far as not dealing with people who are drunk and/or upset about losing money and risking my health for only marginally less work than the fast food job I was working full time, and only slightly more hourly wage not counting tips."
2202,Recently finished bachelor's but conflicted about current career?,careerguidance,"Long story short, I had graduated in May 2021 with a Bachelors in MIS and immediately went into job hunting since I was 26 when I finished and already felt behind. It took me around 2 months to get my first job which ended up with me working for a large company as a Sales Analyst making around 46kyr in NC.

Now I know entry level job and acquiring real world experience at a corporate level and all that stuff comes into play but I'm about to cross my 6mo mark at this company and it's been great but finishing school and making 46k seems... Unfulfilling and almost insulting? Maybe it's expected but I'm not so sure. The job is cushy, my boss is easy to work for, I'm a wiz at the job and fly through most assignments and do random pop up projects he loves on my hyper productive days (I'm ADD, sometimes I hyperfocus) but with 6 months coming to a close im curious if it would be time to find a higher paying position.

Technically MIS leans much more heavily towards software and IT than sales in the first place, but analytics fits the bill I suppose. A lot of my skills are in programming and excel and things of that nature.

I'm just looking for some opinions here, should I stay where I am for the time being a bit longer? I'm planning to attempt to move into an apartment soon but I likely won't be able to save much or invest much in retirement and things of that nature for now. Or should I start looking around at the 6mo mark? I guess I'm concerned that's too early as a recent grad."

Figured I'd ask the internet's opinion on this matter - first things first - I'm a contractor at Google doing work that I love. However, during signing of my contract to be onboarded- I wound up taking a pay cut as the agency wasn't able to match my original pay from my prior contract. 

With this is mine I figure the $14k pay decrease was worth it just to get Google on my CV for future roles. 

I currently have 5 months left of the contract and they'd likely extend it, but I was approached by another 'big name' company that is willing to pay $95/hr (I'm currently making $55) for a 6 month contract.

A couple of staff members got Covid after the holiday season but the company doesn’t allow us to work from like in 2020. My work is completely doable remotely and we have done it, but ever since California opened in June last year, the company wound allow us to work from home unless it’s the the law.

I’m disappointed by the company’s stubbornness around remote work policy and frustrated that these decisions are made by the owner of the company(who is never be in the office)without consulting to the workers. 

However, I am not sure if I should look for the new job or not. I like what I do and I get along with my boss. I work really close to home anyway. Is it really worth to leave the comfortable position that I have? I’m also worried change my job at my age(mid 40s).

The only problem is that I dont feel ready to settle down. I want to travel more and get some kind of crazy job abroad. I figured I'd do this job for a while to save up some money and gain experience and then go back to travelling after about a year or so.

But the guy I am going to work for keeps talking about stuff way in the future like stuff I'd do over the next 4 to 7 years.

However the office is far (over an hr) from where I live. We went remote in March 2020, shorty after I started.

I find it really interesting but (just mentioning I've taken CS as a subject at school, currently learning python) I still enjoy the coding part of making arduino projects (C++). I want to do more pure coding projects too (no hardware). After all of the above I started considering Electrical Eng as an option and for a few months I was dead set on it. I love electricity, electromagnetism, etc too. I thought it was perfect. But my mind is spiraling into CS/SE all over again, and I suddenly want to major in it. I started thinking Computer Eng is a good option as its a combination of Hardware and software. I also think that CS/SE is super competitive overall, do i even stand a chance?

Would it be better to step back even if I feel a bit like I failed?,careerguidance,"I'm an engineer and loved it, but I always wanted to move up. I took a promotion as a manager in operations a year ago. It was a huge step, I went from 0 employees to 100 and a lot more responsibility. I'm the first female and one of the youngest in my postion, so I always felt a lot of pressure to do well. 

A couple of months ago my boss, the general manager, retired and they aren't replacing him (restructure). I'm now reporting to the head office and have absorbed the GM role. It's heaps of work and responsibility with no extra pay and barely any training. We are already under resourced. I feel like I'm capable of doing a good job as a manager and obviously it's great experience, but even though I'm fighting for more people to help, I'm starting to struggle under the extra work and responsibility.

I've recently been offered a job back my old engineering department, which would be better hours, less responsibility and workload and more flexibility for having kids (hopefully soon). It seems like the way to go, but I can't get over feeling like I failed at moving up (Engineering department doesn't have a lot of opportunities for advancement).

That being said, I’m a very lucky liberal arts degree grad, as I landed an amazing job in accounting. I realize that it’s become a career I love - something I would have never thought (math was never really my forte). Because of this, I’ve been toying with the idea of going back to school for my MBA (Masters of Business Administration) to further my career. I know this will definitely help me out in the long run, however, right now I do not have any debt. 

Having to take out loans is daunting. I also have to take a lot of prerequisites, so it’ll probably be over $35,000 for the accelerated program (I’ll be going to school while working full-time). My job will graciously pay over $5,000 a year in tuition reimbursement, but I’d still have to take out loans. I realize I’m asking this from a very privileged standpoint, as my BA is paid for in full. I’m just a very anxious person by nature.

There are like dozens of job titles to start from. I was lately thinking of going into Customer Chat Support because it doesn't require much skill and I can work alone.

2230,Any advice on how to move forward/get out of this situation?,careerguidance,"Hey there! First of all Happy New Year :) 

My backstory: 28M from Germany. After finishing high school I moved to the city, got a degree in IT and worked at a really good international company in Germany. Although being successful and having great benefits, I started strongly disliking the work after about a year there. More specifically the IT sector, the people working there and office life in general. Tried to balance it out with sports &amp; travel but I was so unhappy. Felt really relieved when I finally quit that job.

For some self-discovery decided to do Work &amp; Travel in Australia for 2 years and had an absolute blast. I focused on more practical jobs and worked lots outdoors - construction, trades, farms, animals, fireworks that kind of stuff - anything that peeked my interest honestly. Meeting tons of people and getting to travel most of the country and some of Asia was awesome as well. When I came back to Germany after that, I was expecting to at least know roughly what I wanted to do as I gave myself those 2 years not just to have fun but to actually work on myself and try out as many things as I could. 

Well, ever since I moved back with my parents I'm quite lost and unsure about what to actually do next. I've kinda got myself in one of those situations where I thought myself into indecision. I'm depressed and stuck honestly and completely ran out of money. They live in a rural place with no public transport and I have no access to a car for work... 

I consider myself a very talented guy and whatever I do I'm usually really good at it. Both theoretical work as well as practical work. I know that I have a lot of interests but I dislike going too deep into one topic/thing and committing to something really scares me. 

So basically I dislike the idea of going back into IT but also have no other clear passion/career path I wanna go down. 

Any suggestions on how to get myself out of this situation/place and move forward? Thanks"

2234,Advice for leaving a job with nothing lined up?,careerguidance,"Hello everyone. 

I am in a very tough situation and could use some advice. I won't go into too much detail, but I took a new job 6 months ago that has turned out to be an awful experience. I'm in way over my head, the workload is ridiculous, and my mental health is suffering. I had a bit of a panic attack over Zoom with my boss right before the holidays, and he told me that if this job isn't for me then he could potentially help me transition to something else. 

I started looking for jobs about three weeks ago and have a phone screening lined up for one this coming week. However, I was at the end of my rope today and (naively) confessed to my boss that I didn't think this role was for me, and I wanted to take them up on their offer to help with a transition (potentially to something else in the same organization). Well, they got back to me at the end of the day and said that I had two options:

  
\- Stay in this position and show the improvement that they expect. If I didn't 

\- Give my resignation. He said that he could give me 30 days (until February 4), and that my health insurance would extend to the end of February. He also said that HR could potentially help me get unemployment, and that some people who resigned in the past qualified for unemployment benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, I feel duped. This was not the ""transition"" help that I expected. Frankly, I don't think it's possible for me to stay and improve in the ways they want. I've performed well in several past jobs, and have reliable references to prove it, so I am not a serial under-performer. I just cannot deal with the stress of this job. I'm very afraid that if I try to stay while looking for other jobs, I will be fired. Therefore, I am leaning heavily towards taking the 30-day option. I was told that no performance issues would show up on an employment check if I took this option, and that the organization would just verify my dates of employment and that I resigned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions:

\- For jobs that I have already applied to, I'm worried that the process will not move quickly enough for me to receive an offer in the next 30 days, and therefore my very recent resignation would show up on an employment check. Should I preempt this by telling them in an interview, potentially when they ask me for my available start date, that I will be leaving my current job at the end of the month? I can try to come up with a reason other than extreme stress.

\- Should I put my end date on my resume for jobs that I am applying to going forward? Right now it just says ""July 2021 - Present,"" but I could change this to ""July 2021 - February 2022"" 

Any other advice or encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks!"

2236,DUI &amp; crash left me out of a job and a $40k albatross around my neck - do I double down and go back to school?,careerguidance,"I was involved in a car crash that resulted in a DUI charge and an impending lawsuit for at least $40k. My job at that time was an exterminator, which required little more than a driver's license and certificate. My highest education at this point is a business administration diploma that I haven't used in several years, though I have work experience related to it.

Now I am faced with reinventing myself once again, and looking back over my qualifications, I have very little that easily translates into a high paying job. I am currently pursuing IT as my goal field given a former passion for it, however my true passion is physical fitness - two things that are like oil and water in some ways, but the latter more fleeting than the former.

Further murkying the waters is that IT in my city is extremely competitive, and most positions require a degree to qualify for even entry level positions. I am having to decide if IT is worth the investment of time, energy and money, all while staring down the barrel of a very expensive shot gun.

I appreciate any advice and will probably rewrite this when I perform more reflection."

2. they have “extended” my position three times now, because they claim they like having me around and that i’m a big help 

3. what was supposed to be 2-3 months quickly turned into 6 months.

4. i love the people I work with on a personal level and the atmosphere is great…but hate what my job has become, mostly covering for the receptionist…she often asks me to answer the phones for her while she does “other work” (the less draining stuff to be honest)

5. my job expectations are very blurry, especially because i was originally hired as a summer student… i’m not on contract, i have no benefits like my other coworkers, i don’t get paid sick days or anything…

6. i’m not even in “the system” i do all my work as/under a previous employee that they never took out of the system. I’m not even in the employee group chat to be honest :( 

7. I honestly think i’m probably paid less then my coworkers doing the same work, i’m getting 17$ an hour. 

8. The job as is stresses me out SO much (which totally sucks when you have zero health benefits) because I constantly get told to cover for the receptionist who is often out sick, I often get left dealing with all the angry clients… and emergency situations… a lot of crying clients on the phone and opposing lawyers/professionals screaming at me on the phone.

9. my boss is not very accessible as he spends most of the day in his office with the door closed on the phone etc.

10. My position was supposed to end with 2021 but my boss offered me a new position “doing research” he said they might as me to do a tiny bit of admin work if need be but he claims probably not much.

11. I am kind of terrified that i’m going to walk into work on Monday and simply be told to cover for the receptionist who is almost always either taking a sick day or avoiding the stressful part of her job and leaving it for me. 

12. I am honestly considering quitting on the spot if i walk in on Monday to being told to cover for the receptionist because i’m excited to start the promised “research position”, i wouldn’t have wanted to stay-on if it was to continue doing the admin stuff."
2240,KEYENCE TECHNICAL SALES ENTRY HIRVUE,careerguidance,
2241,Should I take the sure thing or wait?,careerguidance,"My employment contract will be ending soon and I will get a substantial payout when this happens. This payout will allow me to pay off all my debt and have a lot of savings left as well. I have been applying for jobs and interviewing at a bunch of different places (which has been annoying to say the least), and currently I have 2 positions on my mind that are standing out over the rest.

The choices

Job 1: Same job as my current field, total compensation is about 10k less than I currently make (I make a lot in my current job so this is not surprising and I somewhat expected it). I could not really advance a ton at this job, as it is already near the more senior side of things (if that makes sense). Also I no longer can work remotely (I am currently remote and want to keep it that way). Company is not huge and well known but still decent size and a good place to work. Job is basically what I do now which is fine, but it is not my ""dream job"".

Job 2: Essentially my dream job. No clue yet on compensation, but I guess based on google searches it will probably be like 25k less than my current yearly compensation as I would be basically starting over. I would be able to potentially advance quite a bit and after several years be making a lot more than I currently am. I am young enough that I am not worried about starting a new career field, especially this one as it is in demand right now and I have been learning the skills for it for a few years. Job is 100% remote and for an amazing company (constantly mentioned as great place to work).

The dilemma

Just got the offer for Job 1 (which is why I know compensation details) but I am still waiting to do the next round of interviews for Job 2 (things are just moving slower, and I am still under consideration for it). I am leaning towards waiting for Job 2 and rejecting job 1 for now, especially since I don't really need a job for awhile. The problem is I have 0 offer or anything for Job 2, just a hope and a prayer.

2243,How much of a career mistake did I make?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I'm currently reeling over a huge career decision I made. I'm interested in your thoughts, perspectives, similar stories... Whatever guidance or words you have.

The backstory is that I had been a TVC (temp, vendor, contractor) at the major tech company for 4 years, having worked my way up from Receptionist, to Special Event Coordinator, to Event Project Manager. 

Since May 2021, I had been talking to my agency leads at the time about an internal promotion, which would make me (28F) a team lead myself. This role was everything I had dreamed of and been working for, and I would be employed at one of our new campuses and basically help build the experience there from the ground up. While I was extremely excited, dedicated, and basically told that I had the job without issue, my imposter syndrome kept creeping in and told me I wasn't worthy. Additionally, I would have to wait as the major tech company had to approve the job description, budget for the role, etc. This process can take months, and ultimately did. 

However, as I work events for this major tech company, I have a lot of exposure to the many different teams and full time employees, including Directors, Heads of Industry, SVPs, and more. To battle my imposter syndrome, I tend to go... Way above and beyond. As a result, my work ethic is impeccable, everyone loves me, and I'm often requested to handle their events or team requests. It was this very reason that one of my clients asked for me to interview for an open position on their team in mid-November 2021. The role in question was as an Administrative Business Partner who would be supporting a group of directors. In terms of responsibilities, it felt like a step back from my current role, but the possibilities were endless once I was through those doors. Additionally, I didn't think anything of interviewing with them as many people often auditioned for these roles but do not get them, and it's every TVC's dream to become fully employed by their tech or social media companies, as the benefits, pay, and perks offered are way better. 

By December 6th, while I had still been waiting for my team leads to get back to me about the internal promotion, which was still being investigated for approval by the major tech company, I was made an offer for the ABP role.

I took this information to my team leads, as I'm very close with them and believe in transparency, and they were ECSTATIC for me. They opened up and told me that the reason I wasn't officially promoted at the time yet was because the client company were still struggling with defining the scope of the role, how much was being offered, and when the start date would be. They projected that they wouldn't have a firm idea until possibly February 2022 and did not want me to keep the client waiting for an answer. Additionally, they knew that it was every TVCs' dream to convert into a full time employee and urged me to jump on any opportunity that presented itself to me. 

I asked them for some time to think, talked to a few of my friends, my partner, my family, and everyone seemingly agreed– I had to take the ABP role. While it kind of made me sad, as no one understood the attachment I had to the role being offered by my company at the time, I trusted their perspectives and their belief in me. I took the offer, submitted my resignation, and referred my long time friend and old manager as a candidate for the other position whenever it was officially approved. 

This brings me to this week. I just started my new role on Tuesday, January 4th... And I fucking hate it. LOL. 

I'm also so angry because it turns out the client approved the role I was originally waiting for about 2 weeks after I submitted my resignation and my friend was hired immediately for it. Not only that, the offer they made FAR EXCEEDED what was originally discussed with me on December 6th, making it very close in total to what I'd be making with my current ABP role. 

While I'm so excited for my friend (*and I truly mean it– I'm excited for her. She was my original trainer and the first person I thought of when originally approached for the team lead role back in May 2021*), a part of me is mourning what my life could have been with that role. 

Anyways, I'm miserable. I'm going to keep working this job I have now for the next year, prove myself... But I feel like I B-lined my whole career. I can't get that role back because there's only the one position. And I don't even know how to get myself back on track. I feel like a shithead.

2244,I'm considering a career change when I graduate. What can I do?,careerguidance,"I posted this on r/teachers but didn't get much of response, so I'm trying here.

I (22 f) am a teaching intern (unpaid) at an international school in a 3rd world country. I must also add that I'm a final year (4th year) student studying TESOL. I will graduate with a bachelor's degree with honours in Education (B.Ed). I am doing this internship in order to graduate. My teaching mentor is working towards giving me a permanent job here at the school but I'm seriously having doubts.

Management at my current school is not great, when it comes to money (immediate red flag). Staff turnover rate is very high too. The overall environment has been hard as I tried so hard to be part of a community that I clearly don't feel belong in. The kids are great. I love them to bits. Once, I've broken down in front of my mentor over the overwhelming stress of returning face-to-face teaching and from not being able to fit in with the staff. I feel very isolated and very judged by not only the expats but by the locals as well. I'm the youngest there and I feel that I'm too young to be a teacher and too old to be a student. 

Everyone in my family tells me to suck it up and take the job offer when I graduate but I don't know if this is a place I want to be in. Conversations about it with my family have left me in tears too because no one seems to understand where I'm coming from as they all try to tell me that everywhere is the same, wherever I go.  I know that I can't escape shitty people but I'm sure there more to work than feeling miserable 24/7. 

The facilities are great, but maybe I'm not cut out for teaching. I think that I am passionate about education, but not teaching... If that makes sense? I love making the materials, designing the worksheets, and the presentations. I love being creative and I love it when I see my kids interact with them. 

However, hearing the horror stories of not just from this school but from other international schools, in regards of pay, management and colleagues, school is as toxic as I remembered. And maybe being here is also triggering my inner childhood trauma (I didn't get a great experience while I was in school and hence, I wanted to be a teacher to make a difference).

I just would like to know what are my career options if I were to leave the profession. I started in September and my posting ends in April. I've been seeing a therapist to manage my work life as well as my mental health. That breakdown I had was a sign that I needed help. I tried to shrug it off most of the time and try to enjoy eating alone and being by myself but it's been hard. I come home feeling upset most of them time because I don't feel like I belong here.

 I just know that I don't want to be miserable and the idea of ""doing for the kids"" isn't going to put food on the table.

My current options are:
1. Continue studying - getting a master's in either counseling or curriculum design, find job after?
2. Stay on the job - take the contract, do it for a couple years, quit. Stay for the experience.
3. Stay in the education profession but not be a teacher - what jobs can I do? Will I be qualified to be that without any experience since I'm a fresh grad?
4. Leave education all together - find a job in corporate? But what will and can I do? My boyfriend has been trying to get me to join corporate as there is better pay, benefits and career growth.
5. Start my own business - I've always wanted a smart art business, maybe that? 

Based on my options, what advice do you have? What can I do?"

Disappointing but understandable! But the other company (which was my dream job), has basically ghosted me it seems and I’m very upset. I had an interview with the president before Christmas two weeks ago, and was told I would hear back next week (so last week).

My job was as an ER tech, basically an EMT that works in-hospital. What I loved about it was doing IVs, applying splints, and doing wound care (cleaning and bandaging).
I had freedom in how I approached the tasks, it was detail oriented and creative, but useful. 

What I hated about the job was the politics. By the end, I wasn’t even doing a tech’s job, I was an underpaid receptionist bearing the weight of a whole waiting room of sick patients. My stress level was through the roof and in many ways I felt like I couldn’t truly help people because of the red tape.

I’m craving a job that lets me be creative, problem solve, and maybe fix or restore things.

2254,HR Manager mentioned my late paycheck in a company-wide meeting?,careerguidance,"I started a job for a small logistics company a month ago. I noticed my first paycheck hadn't arrived when it should have. It happened to coincide with new years weekend so I figured it was late due to the holiday and me being a new hire. The Monday following new years (first day back in the office since holiday), I emailed the HR Manger (who also handles payroll) and inquired about my late check. She was very apologetic and I received it the next day. Fine, no problems there. 

We had a company wide meeting via zoom today, and our HR manager mentioned that if there is an issue with the payroll we need to notify her IMMEDIATELY. She said ""I'm gonna call out u/soi_chegg here who waited 4 days before emailing me about his paycheck. Guys, stuff like that can't happen because then I'll assume all is well."" I didn't even unmute, in fact all I did in acknowledgment was smile. 

I'm entry level and fairly new to office environments, but discussing a new hire's payroll issue in front of the entire company feels completely unacceptable ... right? Especially from the HR manager herself? It doesn't feel worth it to complain, but who would I even go to, the hr manager who called me out?

This was her own mistake and she made it look like it was mine in front of everyone. I'm sure others recognize that this is unacceptable as well, and it's only making her look worse, not me, but still ... wtf?"

After, I got assigned additional work load that incidentally was supposed to go to a new hire, but that person went to a different site and was not available.  My boss asked me to help out, just a few cases.  I stupidly agreed without making calls and complaints to the HR director for the attempt to change the deal we negotiated, just because I need a letter of recommendation and I figured it would be easier to get from the boss if I was a team player and all that.

Fast forward: nothing I've done in the past 4 months has been smooth, having a very difficult work load as far as complexity of work matters and the quantity of them.

My boss declined to go to bat for me and get me some help and I asked my division director to call me and help and of course I got ghosted.  My personal life has suffered and have been depressed because I cannot enjoy my everyday activities I used to because I don't have time, and when I do, I have no interest in life.

I am making plans to leave at the end of the year but I have realized my boss has long feelers, as a lifelong administrator, and can totally sink my career with a bad review.  I figured I love what I do so much I could tolerate a few months of scrambling to get my shit done and work a few extra hours, as some years are just more intense than others.

Yesterday I got my performance review Improvement Plan and I did not know what was going down and was essentially blind sighted.  I was given an 11 page document which will require my signature.  I was not given a chance to review the whole document but I was just led through the highlights.

The first part was the deficiencies my boss noted.  The second part was my supposed improvement plan and the third part was my boss's supposed help for me to get good.  One of the major problems was my boss assigned me to read a 300+ page training manual that I've already read through and highlighted the stuff that pertains to me, but you can't digest 300+ pages of instructions when you have so many duties you cannot get to in the course of a day which isn't above and beyond made up. At that time I was a cross between horrified and confused and appreciative that there may be a chance I could work through the plan and get to where I needed to be. Imagine my surprise when the parts that my boss owed to me consisted of canned professional training courses to help me get good.

Before being asked to sign, which I would have declined, I was asked to look over the document and make sure it was correct.  I went back to my room to print the document and I just shut down when I noticed he had downgraded my time to 50/50% per site when he knows I am 100% at two sites.  That's an outright lie.  I was 100% at one site and was given an entire site so I'm literally 100/100% not 50/50%. I can't agree to that and then everything started to snowball.

I don't even know where to begin.  For one, how about my boss acknowledging that he assigned me the work of two people in the first place that that's WHY I'm struggling to meet my obligations and making mistakes?  Then, I have huge problem with being the action plan giving me more work and none of it is budgeted by time.  How many hours of additional work is he giving me in addition to the work I cannot get done?  He wants to assign me two or three training modules, reading and writing a report on them, reading a 300 page manual and writing a report on that, he wants me to create a plan to collaborate with other professionals and have him accept the plan and go forward on it and report on that too.  How many hours extra is he putting on me?  I started to stress badly and got shaky and felt ill.

At home I forced down food to be social with my family and try to act like I'm ok.  I'm not ok.  I woke up with panic at 2:00 a.m, couldn't sleep, had body aches all night long, and I had to call in sick, I was so shaky and unwell.  The stress has caused me physical symptoms of anxiety, like I feel numb and want to quit and never go back.

Has anyone hears of a performance review done like this with vast sums of extra work thrown into the mix?  Why do I feel I'm being set up to fail and have zero desire to improve my work performance until he addresses my work load?  Normally I'm first on the bandwagon to step up my game but I just want to lay down the sword (and I am not working for the money, I could make a lot more money in my other field but the work is by far more unpleasant).

I just need to know, do I sign and play nice like I have and attempt to crush everything in the next 6 weeks, or do I use my letter from HR to make some other sort of preemptory move and stand up to basically being assigned a 3rd job?"
2258,"Feel like I’m in a quarter-life crisis, any advice?",careerguidance,"I'm 25 now and i'm unsure what my next steps are, a bit of a quarter-life crisis. 

I graduated with a business degree in 2018 and I'm only just starting to understand what I like about a role more a career more - currently I am a digital sports journalist though there's focus on SEO which I really dislike, though I write and have always enjoyed writing. I love sports, though the pressure of having to write about it is slightly swaying me away from it which I didn't anticipate where it now feels like a chore.

It's an office role - currently WFH - but I realise all these job fancy titles, competing for promotions, being in Zoom calls I truly don't care about and office politics just doesn't attract me at all, i'm always feeling like i'm missing out on whats out there, as I really am desperate to move abroad (currently live in UK)

After backpacking for five months in 2019, I came to a life dilemma. My dream would be somethng like going to different countries, writing about food or hostels and just really live a little, or  creating something which allows me to move around, just a job which allows me to be anywhere in the world but is something I actually enjoy! I've realised I need something I believe, that makes and impact or I feel as though I'm making a difference.

I'd also love to have something of my own in terms of a business - I've looked into e-com and Amazon stores/own brand but I just don't know where to start.

One thing I know having spoken to friends in grad roles, is that I feel like I don't want to get sucked into the hamster wheel, when I feel I should 'go against the grain' so to speak, and risk a little to see if I can live a dynamic and different career rather than five years passing by, and I just settled for the office job because it's what society tells you to do. I'm also worried about housing, with that pressure of buying a house and if I did end up going abroad, i'd have nothing left for me back home in terms of security (currently live at home)

Just feeling a little anxious about the future, would be great to hear some guidance and advice!"
2259,How do I start a career with virtually no resources after being homeless? (21m),careerguidance,"It's extremely unmotivating to not have any idea of even where to start. I've graduated high school, but aside from that, I have no other credentials or qualifications to my name, just soft skills, and knowledge. I want to get a job as an administrative assistant to get my foot in the door and (hopefully) launch at least some attempt at a career in IT, as its one of the few options in that field that requires no degree since obviously, I have zero money for education after the streets. I'm lucky to even just have somewhere to sleep. I really want to be able to do something better than a bottom of the barrel, dead-end job, but it feels like thats going to be my only option, especially when I haven't worked since June 2020 due to homelessness, and employers aren't exactly understanding of traumatic life experiences getting in the way."
2260,How long should I wait before mentioning I want to change career paths?,careerguidance,"**Quick context:** I just started a new job \~5 months ago at a company that typically requires employees to wait 12 months before applying for internal roles. Prior to this company, I've worked in my field (HR) for roughly 3 years. 

**Longer context:** 

* Even though I love most parts of HR, I'm starting to realize I kind of hate being an HRBP. But my struggle here is that I *love* my new company and just want to contribute in a different role. 
* My background is in communications (I have my Bachelors and Masters in the field) and both my manager and team have frequently recognized writing as one of my strengths. In an ideal world, I'd transition over to the company's internal communications team. 
* Because I work in HR, I clearly understand that asking to transfer before 12 months requires an exception. And, of course, it's never a guarantee because I'd still have to wait for an open role and go through the interview process. 
* I mentioned this above, but I'm genuinely worried about my mental health. I show up at work every day on the edge of panic and am essentially living for the weekends these days. I used to enjoy work so this feels out of the norm.   


All of this leads me to my question—**how long do you think I should wait before mentioning to my manager that I've been giving thought to pivoting my career?** 

&amp;#x200B;

What worries me the most is that my manager or team may write me off, or not bring me into meaningful work, if I mention it too soon. Not because they are mean, but just because it makes more sense for them to build up the experience of people who want to stay on the team. It could be harmful my career in the event I can't switch or am not chosen for a transfer.   


I also don't want my manager to feel offended. My company invests a huge amount of time into onboarding and training new people, so I don't want this decision to come across like I was using them or trying to waste anyone's time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really any help you can provide would be so helpful. I'm feeling lost and think I just need an external perspective at this point. :)"

2263,Feeling Stuck,careerguidance,[removed]
2264,How do I seek more career Satisfaction?,careerguidance,"Hi everyone. Thank you to those who take the time to read this and respond in advance. A little background on myself. I am a recent college graduate who graduated in May of 2021 with my BS in Marketing. I have been working in various marketing jobs since January of 2021 and have experienced a lot of disappointment thus far.

To start, back in college, specifically in March of 2020, I applied for an internship at a company I was really excited about, after a few interviews and weeks of waiting I was accepted. I was thrilled for only a short amount of time because about 2 weeks after I had accepted the internship they called and canceled the whole program due to COVID-19. While I appreciate the caution and understand where they are coming from, I was still disappointed as I felt this being my first career success, was also my first failure, so it was off to a bad start.

Fast forward to December of 2020. I have now acquired a different internship and completed that, no matter how awful an experience it was, and was now looking for a full-time job. I reach out to some LinkedIn connections and low and behold one of them says I would be a great fit. I apply and was given an offer, and tho the job was not great, I figure the opportunity is better than nothing to get some experience. Once I start, I am immediately disappointed with the tedious very easy almost patronizing level of work, the compensation, and the overall culture, and the product that is being delivered to clients. I am again very unhappy with this role but wishing not to be labeled a job hopper, I keep the job for 6 months before a recruiter reaches out to me.

The recruiter who reached out to me is representing a very well-known large and respected company and I think, ""okay this is my shot, I am still early in my career and I can learn a ton here that will set me up for success in the future"". The job is a marketing analytics job where the recruiter says I will be learning, SQL, Tableau, SAS, Power BI, and tons of other tools I love and try to learn in my free time, so learning them in the workplace and applying my skills here will be great! Yet, when i start this role, I do not use any of this. Instead, I am taught a marketing automation tool that not many companies use or care about. Again I am disappointed. But, I stick with it, get good at my job, earn the respect of my team, other teams, managers, and start feeling good about the shitty situation I am in, despite the lies. However, I am still disappointed because 

A) this is a contract position

B) this compensation is the exact same as my last job even though I have more experience

c) I have tons of downtime and am not given an opportunity to expand my knowledge of other areas I was promised I would learn

But again, I stick with it, mainly because I am given the guarantee that if I prove myself then I will be brought on full time with a pay raise, promotion, pto, benefits etc. Then 3 months ago, I am given the news: talks are being had about bringing me on full time with at long last more than the paycheck to paycheck income I have been living with. I am so excited, my first promotion ever, my first raise ever, and an opportunity for growth. 3 weeks ago they tell me that January 7th of 2022 (Today) would be my first day as a full time employee with a raise and promotion, they have me start looking at 401k matching benefits, insurance benefits, we discuss salary etc. Then today gets here. And ya know what happens. My boss schedules an out of the blue 15 minute call and I know in my gut already, that my string of disappointment is not about to be broken. I get in the call, and he says ""we are sorry but we are retracting the offer, not because of anything you did, we are keeping you on as a contract worker, but because our budget has been cut due to upper management.""

Guys, I dont know what to do anymore. Everything in my career has been disappointing. I have been making less than 45k ever since i started my career and no matter how much I go above and beyond my and my bosses expectations, I am met with disappointment. Im not sure if there is something I am doing wrong or something I need to be doing different, I just constantly see everyone I went to college with and even HS with getting promotions, raises, moving states for careers, and I feel like I am going now where. I left my original major in college that I had a passion for to pursue marketing because I could have a career in it, and I just feel like im constantly fucked. I dont know what advice I am looking for but anything is apprecaited. Thanks in advance."

2268,Can I get advice/encouragement for new job?,careerguidance," I recently started a new job here in the United States after moving from Latin America. It’s temp work with a possibility to become permanent.

I was supposed to start Monday, as I was informed by the agency. I was supposed to pick up my equipment at the company I was going to work for and meet up with an employee from the temp agency (let’s call her Linda). Monday arrives and I try calling and messaging Linda, but she doesn’t answer. I pick up my equipment, worried, but set it up in a desk. I didn’t receive any log in credentials, so I couldn’t sign in. I called the employee that recruited me, and she let the company know. Half an hour after my shift ended, I received the information to log in. I was assured that I would still be paid for that day.

Tuesday, I log in and I am ready to start training. Except I don’t have access to an important system, and I can’t be trained without it. So I tried looking into what to do, but there isn’t anything much that I could do without my system. There were a few modules, but without practicing with the system or a few cases, it’s honestly hard for me to understand.

The problem would be somewhat resolved on Thursday when I could finally receive training. However, there are a few people that started a week or two ago, and there are people that started the same time as I did. I noticed that during the training, everyone had a better understanding than I did and are way ahead of me, even the ones that started at the same time as I did. Queue more training during Friday, but I’m having a hard time understanding the lingo and when they ask if anyone has any questions, I don’t even know what I should ask.

I’m telling myself that this is my first week, and the people have been nice and have told me that I shouldn’t feel overwhelmed and that things would make sense. I don’t want to let them down, and I don’t want to let myself down. But I feel so far behind compared to the others.

At my old job, I used to be a great employee in my department. I even gave training to new recruits. Now I’m back to zero and I feel kind of dumb when I see my new coworkers a few steps ahead of me.

Has anyone had any similar experience? Does it get any better?"

It's hard for me to give a full detailed image of my boss because it includes a lot of personal details I don't want to share but all in all, she has constantly gone out of her way, including in her personal life, to help make mine better.

She's been wonderful and treated me as one would with their own son. She's helped develop both personally and career-wise. 

Unfortunately I've concluded that I will not be able to continue working with her as its a big difference from the career I want (I'm into finance, her firm is marketing).

I am having a dilemma here..

Now job A pays much less in the first 6 months but after that period (and depending on performance) my contract would change starting from the 7’s month and it may reach or even become above the pay of job B.

Job A fits more ""my dream job"" but delays my personal investment plan of 6 months.

2274,I strongly feel like I'm going to get fired within the next few month or few months and I don't know what to do? Is it as simple as just applying to new jobs?,careerguidance,"I've never been fired before. My manager basically gave me a message today stating that they're going to start
 searching for other people to fill my role.

I don't really have any connections so I don't believe I can get a job through connections.

The reason why I'm going to get fired is due to poor performance. 

Here's a general background of my resume:

Education: B.S. Computer Science 

Work Experience:

1 year as a Software Developer (current role)
2 years as an Application  Support Analyst 

I seemed to win a lot of rewards as an Application Support Analyst. So maybe it's just best to go back to a role like that of some kind.

2276,"I stayed too long at my current job, didn’t I?",careerguidance,"This is more of a rant than a question. I stayed at my job for 3 years. People left one by one with maybe only 20% of those people being replaced. Each year the company made less year than previous, but the money wasn’t bad and I deeply hate interviewing so I stayed. After 3 years, I got tired and went to my boss’s office to say I quit without another job lined up. But I was open to contract work which he offered. My pay for the hours would be doubled. No benefits but that was a small price to pay for now working half the time and getting paid almost the same amount.

Well, fast forward 6 months. I just had a chat with my boss in which he confirmed that yes, the company is not doing well. More key people left and there will be less work for me. He also made a passing comment about me getting paid too much and another snarky comment which went something like “well what else can this company do for you”… 

Point being folks, don’t overstay your welcome. If you sense things hitting the fan, do something about it. Don’t wait until a series of uncomfortable conversations where you’re not exactly getting fired but you’re also *not* not getting fired. That’s all. Thanks for reading."

Currently dislike my job a lot. Im married with one kid. 
I want to work in the i.t industry. My dream is to work mainly from home in the computer field.
Are associates degrees even worth it for the tech field I don’t want to get a bachelors right now. I’m just trying to get my foot in the door. Should I take Google certificates
And maybe take the a+ on my own without getting an associates. Or will employers skip over me because I don’t have a “associates” 
I guess my question is how should I get my foot in the door as cheaply as possible. 
And does any one have a range of how much it would cost monthly to get an associates or bachelors 
Sorry if this is hard to read"
2278,Should I make a job switch?,careerguidance,"I just want to get some help with a career decision. 

In my current role, I make about $37.5k per year and the only benefits I have are an option to pay into a retirement account (403b, no employer match), 3 weeks of PTO, and they are paying for me to get my Master's degree. 

While this is great, I recently found a position I am qualified for that would pay between $43k-$54k per year, would give 10% of my income towards a retirement account (also a 403b), has excellent medical, dental, and vision insurance, offers free counseling for employees, gives good PTO, and is a remote position. I have a friend that works for this company and they are helping him pay for a Master's degree as well so that might be an added benefit. 

I am hesitant because although my current job has a lower salary and fewer benefits, I believe it has me on the career path I want to be on. Making this job change could change my career path completely. I love the mission of the company that I would switch to, but would not completely love what I would be doing. 

Something else I should add is that my wife and I have a lot of student loan debt, and she is a teacher who also does not make a lot of money. The generous benefits and higher salary would help us significantly, but something still doesn't feel right about changing careers right now. I would feel a little guilty about leaving my current job after all they have put into me.

I don’t have the best grades but I’ve been offered a prosecutors position so in a few years I will have a lot of litigation experience. I know a lot of US firms have overseas offices but I’m having trouble finding a lot of job listings. Is this worth finding a career counselor for, to point me in the right direction?

I’ve been working food and retail jobs not getting paid what I’m worth and honestly I’ve outgrown it. 

I don’t mind going to back to school but only to obtain a certification or possibly even an associates if necessary. But I’m looking for more of a shorter term option.

2285,Is there any way to not vehemently despise studying?,careerguidance,"I've been in and out of university for a couple years now and have always sucked really hard at studying or even staying committed to things. I was the kind of person to just walk off home if I got bored with high school or just didn't like what classes I had that day. I would always kick up a fuss about doing stuff that did not immediately interest me at that moment. 

Because of this I never gained any academic discipline going into university. I keep telling myself this will be the day I turn things around and work on my labs, but I then immediately lose interest and do something else. Repeat until I have to get a 2 week extension and ultimately fail the course. 

After doing this for about a year and a half I dropped out and got a job in IT working as a NOC Engineer which then turned into another job as a security engineer. I make really good money for my age at 85k and would be happy to keep working and learning on the job, my employer is super encouraging and I'm learning stuff that genuinely interests me. 

However, if I ever want to leave my country and work overseas, I need a bachelors degree. It doesn't matter how many years of experience I will get in the future, I will never have the same advantage as other candidates or even eligible for a visa because I don't have a degree. So getting this is a must for me. 

I'm currently studying Computer Science part-time at my local uni but still struggling to balance work and study life. Work is going great but I just can't for the life of me sit down for 30 minutes to work on completing my labs. I'm already up to my eyeballs in due dates and seriously need to find a way to catch up. 

Any advice would be great!

2287,Wanting to switch job roles within my company. Good idea?,careerguidance,"TLDR: In IT and want to switch to Finance within the same company. Good idea?

I am currently in IT but I want to switch to Finance. The pay in IT is really nice, currently making $70,000/year, but I have no Finance experience or Degree (currently working towards Degree and the SIE cert).

I want to move to the Finance sector within my work place because I think it would be easy, but I’m worried that if I talk to my boss about it, they would think I am not going to take my IT job seriously anymore and cut me. Even if he says no, then he will always know that I am not interested in IT anymore and would rather move to Finance, which could (potentially) cause tension. 

And it’s not that it would be easier to switch, but the pay for entry level finance within the company is pretty good as well. On top of that, I have good relations with the Finance people here, (except for the big boss of Finance). So that relationship would make it easy to transfer over. Someone here transferred but I cannot get in contact with them for the life of me. (I think they are switching companies) But they were able to get into the Finance department because they have been with the company for a while. 

Should I go for it? Or search somewhere else? If I go for it, how would you guys recommend?

Anyone have experience with this?

Specifically, how do administrators and other teachers feel about industry experience as it relates to your experience and salary? I know I'll take a pretty big pay cut going from senior engineer to teacher, but if I have 25 years of experience and a Master's Degree, are they going to compensate me the same as a teacher with the same credentials, or at least 10-15 years of experience?

2291,"Should I prioritize taking vacation or leaving on a ""good note"" more?",careerguidance,"Higher Ed job in the US. I also study at the same university to get my Masters. I'm planning to ramp my job search into full gear for the next couple months, starting with an application to a position that I'm so well qualified for that I would almost feel sorry for the small college if they didn't at least give me an interview. (It's an all women's college - my alma mater is an all women's college; the position is in financial aid/ enrollment with about 1500 students - my current position is in financial aid/ enrollment with about 15000 students). 

What I am unsure of is when I finally get a job offer, if they want me to start within a month, should I prioritize using my vacation time or leaving in good standing? 

Quitting with less than a week's notice would really put them in a bine seeing as I'm one of only 3 counselors at this large university and they don't have a single application for either of our other positions that opened up about 2 months ago. I also study at the university so I will eventually, likely, have to talk to someone in this office again. I also really need the reference of my supervisor in the future seeing as this was my first professional position out of college. Not to mention that if I were to quit in the next month, it would be in the thick of Spring registration (super busy time) and right before Summer/ Fall registration (even busier). I'd feel a little bad for leaving my other two coworkers to handle it seeing as the uppers work our fingers to nubs as is. 

Alternatively, I have a trip in the works to go to Norway as part of my 30 countries before I'm 30 goal, and to meet my fiance's family, in the first week of March during Spring break (so I won't miss any important grad school deadlines). I want it to be at least a week long but I might not have time for it if I get a job offer that wants me to start within a few weeks. I'd be forced to either **quit and go** or **stay and not go for almost a year.** I'm also quickly reaching a point of burnout, especially with my semester starting next week, so I could really appreciate a longer break from work. Plus if I quit without taking vacation, I'd get the pay instead, which would be about half a month's salary.

I know, I don't have the job offer yet. I don't even have the application submitted yet. But I want to solidify my exit plan and I need guidance from other more experienced professionals. What would you do?"

2294,Is my raise request unreasonable?,careerguidance,"I have been interning at a company for a while, and they've offered me a perm position there. Name change only and my salary stays the same. I'm currently on £26k a year, and I have a review meeting in Feb to discuss preformance etc. The truth is for the work I'm doing and my degree, a graduate salary in the industry would be around £32k a year. I don't know if I can ask for a £6k increase in salary, is that acceptable? This is my first job out of uni.

I didn't actually expect to be here permamently, but I really enjoyed the internship position I had and the company, so that's why I asked to be made permament. I was told I could ask for a raise at my review, which is why I said yes to the salary being maintained, but I'm not comfortable with the salary unless they're going to offer me a significant increase, but on the flip side I don't want to leave after 6 months over a salary dispute!!"

My partner is looking for teaching positions at universities and colleges in the area, like lecturer / adjunct positions.

2300,Can you poke holes in my plan to switch careers?,careerguidance,"I have been a stay-at-home parent for the last three years and will continue for three more. Previously, a middle school teacher, my salary was $55k with terrible benefits, topping out at $75k at retirement. I do not want to return to teaching due to the low quality of the local school system and the high stress of the job. Unless I become a principal ($90-100k, minimum 60 hours/week/year round), I will be going over the same material every year until I retire. 

My current plan is to study programming and security, ideally landing in ethical hacking when the children are in school. I am attracted by the puzzle aspect, higher pay than teaching, and the long-term outlook. I also like the idea of being able to do this indefinitely and not rushing to retire.  

Is this a reasonable pursuit? Am I missing something? Should I stay the course with teaching? Is there a way to apply my education and experience to something in tech that I don’t know about? Any tips?

Please attack this plan. Enlighten me. Know that your advice might make life easier for one random human being. 

Thank you!

Education: 
MFA in Graphic Design from a small state school. MS in Community Leadership, from a different small state school that was obtained for a pay scale bump, not for usefulness and it is not really scientific. Two lifetime teaching licenses, from yet a different small state school."
2301,UK - How to find employers in Europe? (Tech),careerguidance,"I'm in my 30's. My current role is in software distribution.  I package up software and work with technologies to deploy it to users machines. I have an honours degree in Software Development - though frankly I more prefer application packaging. It's a somewhat niche role, and it can be quite difficult finding people with the skills, but not incredibly so.

Eventually I would like to work in Europe in an alpine nation. Slovenia/Switzerland/Germany/Austria. How can I make this happen? The first step is likely learning some German. But that asides, with employment law I'm of the understanding that it's very difficult now to hire people from the UK.

Are there any success stories? Do people have any luck with just applying? If you used a job in the UK to pivot abroad, how do you do this without relying on chance?"

back in 2019 i took Film production that lasted till 2020 but i had to drop out., because of the covid pandemic. the whole program was paused for the first half of 2020.

i figured out that it wasn't really my thing. i feel like film production isn't something i can make a living with because of where i live. Not really a big film industry here.

So now i want to go back to school and learn something different, i don't really want to do another long term course again because i still have student loans from my previous one.

Ever since covid started back in 2020, i have been just stuck in my house not knowing what to do and just became depressed. i want to find work again, but not just some part time low minum wage job. so i want to go back to school and get a certificate that can help me find an actual stable job in the tech industry

i was thinking of getting into the tech industry because alot of people have been saying that its booming and it has alot of stability. and also depending where big payouts.

I don't really have any background in I.T and i don't think i have the qualifications to apply for it in college. also its a 4 year diploma course.

Is there any other Tech related Jobs / courses that is short term?

i know that there are trade jobs, i considered them too. but i don't really want to go that path yet.

Any suggestions and recommendations are appreciated. Thank you!"

2305,Debating between 2 job offers: 42k 2 year contract vs 52k contract to hire?,careerguidance,"I currently make 20 an hr or 42k, and this job is offering 25 an hour or 52k. However, the 52k job is contract to hire. My current job I already have health insurance through, and the other one, I would have to wait 60 days for health insurance. My current job is more logistics analyst where we do SLA tickets on devices in the store, wipe them, and call the stores to fix transport errors. The other job is a service desk analyst job where I would be taking 30-45 calls a day dealing with Citrix, Operating system, boot errors, drive mapping, etc. And they preferred the average call time to be under 13 minutes. 

He was saying supposedly they hire people after 3, 6, or 9 months, and all I have to do is basically show up and complete my tickets well. I don't know how truthful that is though. He was saying that the contract company wouldn't have made a deal with the company if it was a revolving door where there constantly turning people over, so that want someone to get hired on.

My current job is just a 2 year contract, that is not contract to hire with no promotion opportunties, and pays 10k less though. My current job seems more chill tho, so I'm wondering if 10k more is worth the stress of taking more calls.

The second job seems like it would have more promotion opportunities if hired on though because it's for an insurance brokerage. Whereas, my current job is for a big retail company that seems like they just hired us to do busy work tickets, and I'm not really learning anything. My current job as a whole is fairly chill though since I only have to take a few calls compared to 30-40 at the other one. 

I've heard a lot of people say not to take contract to hire roles because you're always worried about keeping your job. But, some people tell me it's a no brainer and to take it because it's 10k more, and the 2 year contract role will run out anyways. So, is it worth it try the contract to hire role or stay at my current job? I"

2311,My employer gave me a very underwhelming promotion/raise. How should I approach them about it?,careerguidance,"Some background: 
31yr old and I’ve been with my current employer 8 years now. I’ve consistently been a high performer and my performance reviews reflect that. 

I came on in the IT department and from my work I was then given a fairly unique opportunity to move into our strategic operations group. The role I took on was essentially a hybrid role of technology and deep analytical understanding of the business. To give an idea my specific job is something that perhaps a handful of people in a company of 40,000 employees can step into and do today. Today theres 2-3 who have shifted away from my area. 

One has now announced retirement in 2 months, and one has moved onto a new role higher up in the company. This has left me as the sole expert and I’m currently training 3 people including my supervisor on the work. 

I moved in underpaid, and was given an aggressive timeline to move up in pay and position for my role. Our company did aggressive cost cutting and headcount reduction as many did in 2020. We were not given a merit/cost of living raise in 2020.

Currently situation: 
As part of the coming retirement leadership confirmed I’d step in as the team lead (not the supervisor) and gave me a promotion for doing so. I was skeptical but optimistic due to the high leverage I had they’d try to blow me away to lock me in, but unfortunately they came in with a 8% raise, no sort of retention bonus or vacation,etc. My expectation was probably double that and they had floated the idea of a large retention bonus but it hasn’t materialized.

There’s a ton of demand in my old career that I’ve considered moving back toward. I’d be looking at 15-30% pay above the raise just given if I did but for now I’d be satisfied staying if they improved my compensation. I feel like my niche gives me high leverage and I’m surprised the company hasn’t done more to ensure I don’t leave knowing there’s not someone who could step in to handle my role if I left. They’d literally have to dump it on one employee to step down in responsibility to do the work and candidly they don’t have the same level of expertise I do. 

Where I’m stuck:

How aggressively should I pursue it? It feels like they’re in a tough spot. I know I have a solid case to support more compensation and I have the leverage. At the same time don’t want to burn bridges or risk any termination prior to having a move to securing a new job."

If I don't get it, I'll quit because I would just be training someone to do my exact job. 

I was told that they needed 3 qualified candidates before they could hire for it. An external recruiter reached out to me about the job, not noticing that I work here. They won't stop calling me now. I was going to talk to them, so I gave them my number, but afterwards thought it was a bad idea. So I haven't answered.

It’s a much smaller company than I’ve ever worked at (most of the people have been there a very long time; and it’s been the only place in their career) - that could be it.

The MEETINGS get rescheduled or called with very short notice run way way way over (sometimes as long as an HOUR past time). 

Although I block out items on my calendar such as medical appointments or the half hour that I need to pick my kids up, people are constantly scheduling meetings over my stuff (last minute; groups of 2-3) and expecting me to be there anyway.

Today it became a problem because 75 minutes into a 45 minute meeting, I got a text message that her relative had died (not something my family handles terribly well) and I had people yammering on and on and repeating themselves.

I also have concerns, that what we are being asked to accomplish is not necessarily realistic.

2315,Should I drop out of my teacher prep program and go into the field of UX?,careerguidance,"I'm thinking of dropping out of my teaching degree to go into the UX field. Is this a horrible idea?

I am looking for a career that pays well ($60k minimum, ideally more) that requires fewer than 40 hours per week ideally. I like the idea of UX because it's creative, doesn't require more education (I already have a bachelor's), and pays well.

2318,Any legitimate work from home/ set your own hours jobs?,careerguidance,"Hood River, Oregon, USA

Do you know if there is any legitimate work from home at your own pace / hours jobs? 

I’ve heard of things like medical transcribing, ghost writing, editing, etc. However,  anytime I do any research I’m just blasted with hundreds of scams or MLM schemes. 

My background: I work full time, but I have access to a computer. Sometimes I’m busy literally every second of the day, and sometimes I will go a full week with like 3 hours of actually working. But I’m the clock, sitting in my office, with nothing to do. My work allows me to do whatever I’d like during my free time, as long as I’m in the office and available to do what I need to if it comes up. 

I also work long shifts so sometimes I have 3-4 days off a week and I’d love to make extra income depending on availability and what not. I do doordash on the side, but unfortunately I can’t do leave during my shift so I need a phone call/ online job that I can pick up randomly as I have time.

2323,Contemplating major career change. Should I take a 10$ pay cut to be home more with my child?,careerguidance,"Hey all. Coming out of maternity leave next week and I have been going back and forth with changing jobs to better suit our young family's needs...but I don't seem to be getting great advice. I posted this in  parenting subs, but I didn't get much feedback. Maybe this sub can help!

I currently work as a traveling phlebotomist. I have been at my current job for 7 years. I have climbed the ladder and have been promoted multiple times, making great pay for phlebotomists in my area. I am working at a supervisor level. I have no college education, so this is a major thing to me...I've worked very hard to make this hourly rate, starting at the bottom.

To be blunt, I make 20$ an hour. We often work 50 hours a week with lots of overtime pay.
I am in a local Teamsters Union with amazing health insurance.
I have the respect and more importantly the *friendship* of everyone I work with.
I have a second family, liking people i work with really matters to me. I have been cast out or shunned in other workplaces, so being the person everyone relies on and likes makes me feel good...Going to work every day never made me sad, and I never wanted to call in ""just because."" I genuinely like my job most days. 

But...we work 12-13 hour shifts 4-5 days a week. Weekends also. Our schedule is 100% random. There are days that are 3am-5pm. Or 3pm-9pm.
Often they are 9am-9pm. Its just the nature of the daily traveling. We travel up to 100 miles from our home base. This is NOT sustainable with a baby. Who watches a baby until 9-10pm? What if there is an emergency and I'm 60 miles away? 

I have the ability to get a new job in the public library system as a custodian. Major career downgrade. It only pays 11$ an hour. But it has city insurance (VERY GOOD). The family will be on my insurance, so this matters to me. It's Monday-Friday. 6am-2:30pm every day. I would be home every evening. My Fiance works 3pm-Midnight. Perfect timing. This is the exact set up my parents had raising me, and I LOVED having my dad hang out with me during the day, then mom coming home and making dinner and hanging with me in the evening/putting me to bed. 

This is just...such a loss in pay. We can financially make it work with some big cutbacks/lifestyle changes, but I am finding im having such a hard time letting go of my current job. I worked so hard to get where I am. But I don't know if I can keep working these hours. Imagining my mom (grandma) putting her to bed most nights makes me want to cry. I have a primal urge to be there for my daughter, but my heart is breaking for the strides I've made for my career. 

(Also, working as a phlebotomist in a different setting will do me no good, they barely make over 15$, and still work long shifts with mediocre health insurance in this area. There is no room to move up, unless I got my bachelor's in lab tech and was able to supervise the lab. I won't be going back to school. Just not an option. Also, hospitals are a fucking nightmare currently. Not wanting to subject myself to that. Would rather clean library toilets in peace. )


Gah. So many words! If you've made it this far into my rambling, thank you.

How do I approach?,careerguidance,"I was recently hired in with a promise of two 8-hour shift options (2am-10am, 10am-6pm). When interviewing this was one of my main factors into switching from my previous job where I was working 12 hours a day w/ rotating weekends. I am a controls technician currently working 8am-4pm. Upon my start at this new company I was told I’d have full training with their systems, but never received it. It’s been 2 months now and after many emails I am finally receiving proper training on the whole system. With that being said there was a change in supervisors. My old boss who hired me, was moved onto a different position and my new boss was the one who mentioned I’d be working 12 hour days which was mentioned to her by my old boss. Sadly there was no written agreement on the 8 hour shifts. It was all agreed upon through phone, the only type of agreement/contract is my offer letter that only states my compensation.

On the other hand, for the past year, I have worked part-time with my family’s company. I have progressively taken on more responsibilities and I know when I do graduate they will be looking for someone to take on my role and other responsibilities in a full-time position. When speaking with my mom I floated the idea of being full-time at the company - she mentioned the pay would be in my desired range and I would work from home.

If I choose to work within the family company I could still volunteer in assisted living and pursue my passion that way. I also know that I would be developing great skills that could be applied to other jobs later down the road.

I would prefer to get into ERP consulting. If not, I would focus on management consulting. I would be happy getting experience in either with the goal of ending up in ERP.

My next step is to look at getting certificates in one or two ERP platforms to help my resume since there’s not a ton of relevant experience on my resume yet.

Any advice on next steps? Or ideas on how to bolster a resume for consulting?"

2337,Why doesn't your salary automatically raise to reflect payband increases?,careerguidance,"Am I the only one that this feels wrong to? My company gives out pretty low merit increases 4% is the max, and very few people get that. I've been averaging 3.5% each year, but the range for my payband has been increasing more than my merit increase. So I'm basically at a lower range in the band from when I started despite getting merit increases. Is it kind of wrong that they increase the bottom and top of the payband, but don't increase your pay proportionally?"

The check started on the 4th but the issue is that Checkr estimates that Cook County will respond by 1/19 when my start date is 1/24. I want to give two weeks notice so the earliest to do so would be today. 

How should I approach the issue? The new company is okay with delaying the start date but I would like start as soon as possible as my current environment is pretty toxic."
2339,"Bigger company buying the company I work for, but nobody is excited. Why?",careerguidance,"So I work in property management, it’s pretty fun, at least to me. I do reservations and it’s really simple. Well earlier this week, we had a big meeting where some people from a bigger company came in and announced they would be buying us, and hoped to buy all of the other vacation rental companies in the area and within a couple years, we would all be merging into one big company with different offices. They promised us our jobs, a 401k matched by 6%, a pretty decent insurance plan, and a bunch of other cool stuff. I’m really excited actually!! We had 1-1 meetings with the people who came to see us and they told us that everyone is getting raises, that the company minimum is $15 an hour, I make less than that anyways so it’s exciting. I seem to be the only one in my office who’s excited, though. I’m 18 years old, they’re giving me the opportunity to make more money, and go on paid vacations practically anywhere in the world while keeping my job, and I’ll be able to work from home. I don’t see any downsides to it. They’re bringing in some new employees since our office is made up of about less than 20 people, including maintenance and housekeeping… is there a reason nobody else is excited? I don’t see it really going wrong but I mean even if it does, I now have office experience, I’m 18, and can very easily go somewhere else."

Others around my age with my degree are making double and even triple my pay. But I am comfortable with my job as it allows me to stay home and have the energy to help my mom who recently got diagnosed with Parkinson’s.

I was really looking forward to this job but Unfortunately some recent issues have me thinking otherwise. Without getting into too much details or specifics, it's a combination of family medical problems that require personal care and personal commitments.

As part of the on boarding process, I signed a contract and started the security check process on late December and I believe it's still in the 'verification' stage as of right now.

Just wondering if I can 'decline' a job offer after signing the contract and/or how I should bring this up to the employer. Should I explain my situation or just a general 'I'm no longer interested'? 

Im recent grad and this is my first full time job actually featuring a contract and not text messages from a manager asking me to come to work on the next hour. So just not sure how to really solve this problem without coming across as an ass who just wasted everyone's time

2352,What is a normal (non toxic) workplace culture like?,careerguidance,"To start, I've worked a few jobs in Sales / Analytics and so far I haven't seen what a real 'healthy' work environment should be like. 

My current role is extremely high stress, high pressure, with lots of toxic cultural practices: 

* The Leadership by in large doesn't seem to know fully what they are doing. They've got to this level some how but it seems like the company is largely carrying forward 1980s work style and culture. They work hard to keep their brand and 'seem' competent rather than actually having a leadership team that is truly smart and forward thinking.
   * My direct leader is constantly ""bsing"" in meetings, but is extremely dependent on me to really understand the numbers and he feeds off of it. When he doesn't get something he tells me ""You need to be on top of this, why don't you know this?"". I actually do know it, he just doesn't know it himself so he wants to shift blame to me.
* I constantly feel like the credit for my work may be taken by my leader or others. 
* My role / responsibilities are free flowing. I am asked to do a whole variety of analytical things. Including things that are actually my leaders responsibility but he is too slow to understand them so he involves me in everything to get it done. Recently a co worker got a new role and all of her responsibilities are slowly sliding to me without any pay increase or anything. On top of this, I was already drowning in what I already had to do.
* My work hours are 9-5, but I was asked to start at 8-5 instead. I did. But we work extremely long hours, like 10 hours on average a day minimally. I have to work even more at certain points to get things done. I'm promised that ""when things are calmer, you can take off early and i'll be flexible"" but it never really calms down like that. 
* There are constant promises of ""you are going to take my position one day"" etc. But in my mind, as soon as my leader were to leave, no one would really know the sacrifices i've put into this job nor would they care. 
* I've developed amazing things in my role, and over the past 1.5 years, I'm constantly told that this is wrong, or that its not good enough. Apparently however, i came to know that other regions and departments are really eager to get their hands on what I made and that it is really amazing. 
* I did get promoted, but when asking for more money, it seemed like I really had to pull teeth to get anything. 

Is it normal that there is so much constant stress on a daily basis? What is a normal job supposed to be like?

I have like 50 tasks to do daily and they are constantly changing day to day. But I see some other co workers in other departments working on a power point presentation for 3 days with an entire team behind them; Compared to me doing the same presentation on my own in 3 hours, while doing 50 other reporting tasks and adhoc reqeuests. I see other employees working on perfecting a reporting tool for an entire month with a team to deliver a quality product, where as I'd be doing the same thing on my own in 1-2 days cause everything is needed yesterday....

There is so much dependence on one person and at first I took it as a learning challenge that I get exposed to so much. But now its starting to take away my sanity.   


I want to apply internally to other roles, but I just don't see my Leader being very supportive. He simply can't afford to lose me and I'm hoping I'll get more money as a result. But regardless, the leadership seems so unaware of what work is actually like in the rest of the companies."

2359,"Looking to go self employed ASAP. in the meantime should i stay at a place with a toxic working environment but flexible working hours, beneficial to someone trying to start a business in downtime OR find somewhere to work in a related industry but could be less flexible?",careerguidance," Hi  all, hoping to read some of your opinions into my situation and what  you all think i should do. please see below. (apologies in advance for  any wrong spelling, i have no spell check!)

Within  3-5 years, i aim to be self employed, and running my own business, and  this is the year that i will begin taking steps towards reaching that  goal, alongside working my full time job, after hours and at weekends.  now the thing is, the place that i currently work full time, isnt the  best. the work is hard, and i arent compensated very well at all for the  quality and volume of work that i do. on top of this, the managment  absolutely sucks, and the working culture is very (cliche warning)  toxic. and that makes it very dificult to want to come to work at all.  The upshot of the company is, that theyre suprisingly flexible with  working hours and annual leave. which would benefit me whilst i attempt  to set up my own business.

My  other option that im considering is to go out and get an entry level or  trainee job in the industry im looking to set up my business in. to try  to get out of my poor working environment and start to cement myself  into the industry and really get involved with it to add some kind of  extra credability to my name before im working independently. it would  be relevent experience, but may not necessarily pay as well due to my  lack of real working experience, and may also be worse hours. working 9.30-5.30 for  example is not as convenient for me as my current hours of 7.30 to 4-ish  and would make it harder to work on my business.

The  reason i am a bit stuck is that if this year goes well, then by next  year my business COULD be sufficient enough to replace my income at  work, i may have to scrimp and save but it could get me out of my job.  but of course that is subject to significant change. and i dont know if  the flexibility that comes with working where i am, is worth putting  myself through working somewhere that i dont enjoy, even remotely.

for  claritys sake, im based in the UK, im 21(m) and earning just about the  minimum wage. my current job role is in purchasing, at just above entry  level.

Moving also isn’t an option for me. My only past jobs are in coffee and currently I’m a driver who delivers construction equipment. I’ve worked this job for 6 months and I now have tendinitis in both hands from injuring myself picking up large items, and I’ve started having back pain for the first time from sitting in a truck all day. Its also really boring, I liked working in coffee More as it was more active and engaging. I have severe anxiety but I quite enjoy interacting with customers. Ideally I would like to have a career where I could make more than 20$ an hour with possibly of raises.

In university I was struggling with mental health and chronic illness so took a while to graduate and wasn't able to build up the project experience that most other students did. I was terrified I wouldn't be able to find a job when I graduated but actually managed to find one and start before I even finished classes. I studied broadcast media and the job is at a small company in a pretty related field. Because of the nature of the company and my position, the job is pretty stable and I think I could probably stay here for many years if I wanted to. I've currently been working here for about 15 months. 

My job is fantastic for lots of reasons. I get to work from home which means I can work around my chronic illness needs and take breaks when I need. My Boss is very kind and easy going if I need to adjust my weekly schedule. I work part time and have a good work/life balance. 

There are two big issues I have though. I get paid enough money to get by, and more money than I've ever had in my life but it's really not a lot. I'm barely above the poverty line and cant help but imagine how much comfortable I would be making the money many jobs in my field pay (2 or 3 times what I'm currently getting).  An even bigger issue than that is I don't care about 90% of the content I'm working on and I find the work incredibly unfulfilling. The work was challenging at first but once I got the hang of it my days became pretty monotonous. I feel really drained after working and know it's contributing to my declining mental health. 

I have three things I want: 

\- A more challenging/fulfilling workday.

\- More money from my job. 

\- to avoid stagnating in my career/skills. 

I know I'd have to change jobs to get these things but I'm not sure how exactly to go about that or when would be a good time to look into that. Should I wait until I've been here for two years? More? Less? Should I tell my boss or keep it a secret? I'm also worried about leaving my boss/coworkers in a difficult position handling my work until they find someone else and train them up. I'm also terrified if/when I do pursue this change that I wont be able to find a new job or I wont be able to cope with more demanding work/a more demanding workload. 

  
If anyone has any advice or words of wisdom so I could come up with a wisp of a plan for my future I would greatly appreciate it!

I am into my 2nd year at my 3rd full time job (regional sales) ever since leaving University.
And here I am, questioning my life choices, and pretty much feeling miserable at work everyday. 
Feels like I made terrible life choices at every turn, wrong diploma, did not try to study overseas for degree (PS. I would like to move overseas one day, SG is too hectic, crowded and warm for me), wrong degree, terrible career that doesn't suit me, no actual experience or skills to take on a career that interests me.

Not sure what's the next step... Appreciate any advice available.

Are there any other jobs out there similar to ATC? Not necessarily in the same industry but something skills based? In operations that doesn't require some specific qualifications?


- Background.
I was never academically inclined to begin with, took a diploma in Mechatronics Engrg (terrible at math, barely graduated) after high school, completed a part time degree in Building and project management. Took longer than most to complete my studies, graduating at 27 years old with my degree. (PS. Had to serve 2 years in the army, mandatory)

Took a degree in Building and project management because I thought that I could use it (coupled with my diploma) to get a more hands on job in the building industry, or do some 3D modelling jobs. Unfortunately, the degree doesn't fully equip me enough for that. 

I have always wanted to take on a career that is more hands on and hard skills based. My ambition as a kid was to be a police officer, applied for 3 years in a role and got rejected, decided that I am too old for the position now, heard horrifying stories about the culture within the uniformed services and experienced some of it during my time in army. 

Had an opportunity to join Air Traffic Control in 2019, enjoyed the heck out of it, but ultimately I wasn't suitable for it, got ""stage fright"" during my assessment, screwed up badly. Stuck in a dead end sales desk job ever since, took the sales job just before COVID hit to try and make ends meet while i continued to hunt for a more suitable one, but it's been 2 years since."

2383,CHRO scheduled a touch base with me about an internal job I applied to in another department and I’m curious about how honest I should be as to why?,careerguidance,"Hello, 31M USA. I do IT procurement at an airport in a top 15 biggest city. It’s a quasi private/public kind of set up but on the whole, more public. When you see public, think outdated systems and processes. I started 5 months ago and right away, my manager and I clicked and it had me really excited for the future based on conversations that we had had as I started out. She was supportive of my ideas/suggestions and we had a great working relationship. This job has been a big change in a lot of ways for me compared to previous roles so clicking with my manger right away was huge. 
Unfortunately, she resigned and took another job just before Christmas because of poor relationship with her two managers, the director and the general counsel of the airport. Now they’re my managers and now I am starting to see why my old manager left. In a nutshell, they’re both resistant to change and not supportive leaders and I’m not interested in working for them any longer. I have a great relationship with basically every other person I’ve worked with except my two direct managers and it’s a really big bummer because I like working at this airport.

So I applied to an internal role in different department a few days ago and was told by HR that I had to notify my direct manger. The CHRO scheduled a touch base with me tomorrow afternoon and I’m not sure how honest I should be around why I am looking to leave my current department. What should I say? Do I keep it short or be completely honest? Somewhere in the middle? I don’t want to hurt my reputation but I would prefer to be honest because my direct managers should not be in leadership positions IMO.  I’m in a tough spot. If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

tl;dr - CHRO set up a touch base to discuss an internal job I applied to in another department and I’m not sure how honest I should be about why I did."

2386,How do I choose between two good options without burning bridges?,careerguidance,"I am at a bit of a tipping point between two good options and I'm not sure what to do.

I've recently moved to a new city and have had to pursue new employment. I left behind a growing business as a horse trainer, something I have spent many years honing my skills on, and am only now beginning to feel like I have something truly valuable to offer.  Building a business on my own is very challenging, as I'm not amazing at keeping books and getting myself out there to potential clients.  My boyfriend is very supportive and has a good job with a steady income, but I feel guilty leaving the majority of expenses up to him while I rebuild. So, I decided to apply for jobs and work for somebody else again.

I recently landed a full-time job working with animals. This particular position is something I have dreamed of since I was very young. This job involves a wide variety of animals and is mostly a feeding and cleanup position, but it is possible that eventually, my duties here will expand to training, which is my true passion.  I am very new and don't have a complete feel of what this job will be like. The pay is also quite low and benefits are the bare minimum. It is full-time and very physical, meaning building my business in my off time may not be realistic. 

Here's where the real conflict begins:

I just received an offer from someone I have worked for in the past, offering almost double the money. I would be on contract for 3 months training horses. This would be the most money I've ever made training horses and could give me a bit of buffer to actually get ahead with my independent business. This work is only short-term, and then I'd be ""thrown to the wolves"" again afterward. This position would begin mid-march, meaning I only have a little over a month at this new job before I have to make a decision. 

Part of me hopes I hate my new job so that it's an easy decision for me lol. The other part is wondering if I should attempt to get an LOA at my new job, which seems futile since I'm still on probation. If I cancel the horse training job it's possible the offer may not get extended again. Advice?"

I have an apartment in the city the job is in, but I’ve been home for 2 months for mom’s appointments. And I don’t want to go back. I like the job so far, love my manager, and am doing really well. There’s already talks of a promotion. This is where I need advice. 

Right the time I accepted the job, I learned that my dad has cancer. My mom also just got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (right at Christmas, so rough). I feel so strongly that I need to be with them. I see my mom slipping so quickly (she wasn’t as bad a few months ago, which is why I took a non remote job) and I only have one mom. I want to be with her. No one at my job knows about my family issues. It’s almost painful taking on new tasks and feeling like I’m just going to have to leave in a few months when they go back to the office. I’ve already been home for a while and it kills me to be paying for an apartment that I’m not living in. I want to move home fully sooner rather than later. 

Do I tell my manager about my parents? Do I just apply for new jobs and quit? They will be so blind sided. I just feel so bad"

2389,What career path deals with international trade &amp; commerce and how can I get that education?,careerguidance,"I'm interested in going into a career that deals with business. In business, I am interested in not only starting my own company but definitely getting into international trade, commerce, and stuff in that nature. I was wondering where could I go to get an education on trade (international trade especially), how a business operates, how to start a company and all of that stuff. When i hear stuff about companies as a legal entity, international transactions, commodity backed wealth, free trade and different forms of trade, a light is turned on in my head and I get so interested in this type of stuff. I used to be in a business program and in the two years that I was in there, I can definitely say that we did not learn about any of these things at all and the program made me absolutely hate business so long story short I switched. I do not know what career path would interest me given what I have listed above. I was considering on going to law school in the future specifically corporate or business law however, I do not know if business law would teach me the things that I am interested in. I would ideally like to get in a career where I would be able to practice that aforementioned topics however I do not know where to even get the education as business school (the one I went to) did not teach me that.

Which is disqualifying, so it all went down from there. I had a back up plan of being a dance teacher at my dance studio but I'm not really into that. Then I thought of going back to dance and being a professional dancer but I'm still not sure... Then I thought about traveling because I love to travel.

I completed my undergrad in Spring 2021 in lifesci, I double majored in Neuro &amp; Immunology but my GPA is something around a 2.2 at the University of Toronto.

I only went through this because my parents wouldn't let me take a gap year after high school to figure out what I wanted so I just picked the first majors I saw and ran with it.

Now I'm here, without a plan, without a career path, unsure of what skills I have, don't know how to find a real job or how to network or who to ask. I work part-time at a Kumon but I need to move on with my life.

I've never been so lost and clueless and I cry every day because I don't know what I'm doing.

2399,"What jobs should I search for, and where should I look, with the experience I have?",careerguidance,"Right now I’m unemployed and looking for work. I’d like to tell my story and get some feedback and, hopefully, encouragement. I’m in western Canada.

I grew up rural and did really well in high school social studies and English. I won an award for social studies and was one of those “pleasure to have in class” people. Despite that, I hung out with a rough crowd and wasn’t into the idea of going to university. In general, my family are tradespeople who don’t value academia. my first job was being a kids program coordinator at the library in my hometown during the summers. I also had a knack for networking and helped to set up and promote a handful of local punk shows in my area.

I moved to a large city a month after graduating (in 2010) and went to makeup school. I did well, but I couldn’t market myself enough to successfully freelance and eventually got a job in a cosmetics retail store…a well known socially and environmentally conscious company as far as cosmetics go. I also took contracts as a TA at the makeup school and another retail job for a short period of time.

In 2014 I quit to work at a makeup counter in a department store. It was this brand’s first time entering Canada and I was excited to actually do makeup and be creative. It was incredibly tough for me though to be an aggressive sales person and I had to leave after 9 months. The brand failed in Canada and was out of the department store a couple months later. During my bad mental health time working there, I started a volunteer role at a park in sort of a host role where I talked to visitors about the plants and animals in the park and I had a blast.

I went back to the well known socially and environmentally conscious cosmetics retail store, this time in a “Team Lead” capacity and grew a lot. I was now much more involved in training, coaching, product knowledge, KPIs, etc. Then, after a development conversation with my manager I moved to the supply chain/factory part of this company. I worked as a Team Lead in part of the factory for 4 years and learned about production, more training/hiring, and a whoooooole bunch of bizarre safety and interpersonal stuff that I never would’ve been exposed to had I stayed in retail environments. I did a lot of good work that I’m very proud of but I was consistently working beyond my title/wage so I started developing myself in other areas. I took a short digital marketing course and started volunteering at a museum on weekends. I did the museum volunteering for a year, and did “extra” stuff like optional training sessions and attending a conference.

In late 2019 I got a supervisory role with a different “green” cosmetics company in the supply chain division. This time I worked in an office doing more production planning/hiring/continuous improvement, lots of interpersonal management stuff…then the pandemic happened and it got very intense. Again, I was doing a lot of important and impactful work that I was proud of, but I was doing much more than I had been hired on for. I worked closely with the HR dept and I know they wanted to develop me in that direction. In early 2021 I started volunteering with a sci-comm group that hosts events, and a paleontology group where I help with basic graphic design. In June I started taking a Change Management course. I still volunteer with both of those groups because they are remote, but I had to pause my course and leave my job in august when I lost my apartment due to basically a natural disaster. It caused a lot of physical and mental health stuff to flare up for me. I had to move back into my moms place after 11 years in the city, ashamed, sick, and bewildered. I had to drop everything.

For the first few months home I just slept and was sick and did online counselling. Now, I’m looking for work again.

I’ve basically been pursuing two paths at once- cosmetics/ supply chain (relatively lucrative but not really good for my brain) and volunteering in science communication (very fulfilling but obviously not paid). My roles in both environments are very communication focused. I’m great at training, leading, stitching together ideas from multiple people in a team, identifying gaps, creative problem solving, etc. I’m very calm even in tough circumstances, curious, and determined to get things right for the people and processes in any organization I’m working with.

I do not want:
- to focus on the minutiae of interpersonal conflicts every day.
- to work in the cosmetics industry.
- to work with rigid, authoritarian people.

I want:
- to make positive change with people who want the same.
- to work for an organization focused on the environment, conservation, green energy, immigration, 2SLGBTQ+, policy… I’d love to work for a nonprofit. 
- something fully remote 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻

Challenges:
- minimal formal education.
- supply chain is kind of an enigma for people who don’t work in it and a lot of the stuff I did is sensitive or confusing to explain.
- my resume is so long because I’ve worked and volunteered in tandem for so long and I feel like I don’t know what isn’t relevant.

Thanks in advance for any advice or help!"

- Working in a team environment
- Structure 
- Room for creativity and writing 
- Teaching others

2402,Being nice to co worker but he thinks I’m interested in more ??,careerguidance,"My direct supervisor is a cool guy. We actually have a lot in common and found out we have a lot of mutual friends but we never crossed paths. His mom owns my favorite spa ! He’s really nice and I think it’s great that I have someone so down to earth as a supervisor . Anyway . We communicate about work via text a lot but I noticed he’s taking the conversation more casual (think - asking questions about me , places I like to go , sending heart emojis )  . I don’t mind talking as a co worker / friend but I want to be mindful because I know sometimes being kind can be taken the wrong way . 

I have a partner / children and I would never jeopardize that but obviously we are allowed to have friends and it’s always a nice thing to get along with your co workers . My shifts are 12-16 hours so I see them some days more than my family , the better we all get along the better . 

Anyway , i could be jumping the gun and assuming wrong but I would like to “lay the law” now in the earlier stages."

2404,FIFO - worth it?,careerguidance,"Hi, 

I’m a 25m Industrial Electrician in NSW. 

My partner and I would like to get ahead, I currently make $100k/pa roughly and her $55k/pa. 

We are hoping to buy a house this year after narrowly missing out last year. We currently have a $50k deposit and $50k invested in shares. 

Our wages are by no means bad or too low to live on but we have been talking about the possibility of myself doing FIFO for a couple of years so we set ourselves up in a strong financial position. 

Is FIFO worth doing unless you absolutely have to?
The financial aspects of getting ahead are what draws me to doing it but the stories of people’s relationships breaking down and the high suicide rate of FIFO workers are very off putting. 

I know people say not to be tricked into the lifestyle creep of earning so much which I’m well aware of and wouldn’t intend to do. My goal is to just save and invest accordingly. 


Any advice or guidance welcome!"
2405,How to make a last minute time-off request to your current company for other interviews?,careerguidance,"Happy New Year everyone! I’m looking for a piece of advice for how to make time for interviews when your schedule doesn’t work out last minute. 

Ive been looking for new opportunities and I’m getting some interviews. One of the companies I’m interviewing with requires me to meet 7 people for 45 minutes each. And theses meetings are happening on 3-4 different days. 

I used the excuse for a medical leave this morning to meet two of the folks. I had three more scheduled for tmr morning but I didn’t put in a DTO request and was wanting to sneak out just for a few hours. However there’s a last minute internal meeting just added to my calendar which conflicts my interviews. 

Now I’m stuck. 

What can I say to my company to make time for my interview? I’m so stressed about the time conflict and can’t focus on preparing for the interview. I’d really appreciate any advice at this point! Thank y’all!"

2417,How am I supposed to network with the people who can help me get where I want to when my preferred industry is almost nonexistent where I live?,careerguidance,"Hi, I'm a freshman college student studying management, about to start semester 2. However, due to heavy course loads and AP credit from HS I calculated I'll be a December 2024 graduate. Which means I have 4 less months than most to figure things out. 

I am passionate about managing in hospitality and tourism. Here's the problem. I live in Indiana. People move here to get away from others. Tourists only really come if they have family in the area. Ergo, in terms of paid work experience, I only have retail experience.

 I plan to move to Orlando, Florida IMMEDIATELY upon graduation.  Right now, I'm putting in an effort at least by volunteer experience at the large children's museum downtown, as well as the zoo. I'm even planning on going away over the summer to work at an amusement park 5 hours away. 

But what am I supposed to do to build connections that will lead to good management jobs in Orlando? I want to use my degree upon graduation (at the VERY LEAST an hourly supervisor role, but better yet entry level management.)

What am I supposed to do? I'm going to have to figure something out soon, because I'm afraid if I don't, I'm going to pay for lost time."
2418,Switching products as product manager?,careerguidance,"So a common path for people who were in my role in my current company is to go into product management. I’ve not really thought about that kind of role but if it happens I’d try it.

The only catch is that I definitely am not interested in doing that kind of role for the kind of products the company I work for makes (think ag/food ingredient products).

So the question is if I were to take a PM role in those kind of products but wanted to take a different PM for say tech or other manufacturing products how difficult would that transition be if possible at all?

Location is Midwest if that makes any difference."

I think given that it's been two internship years since I graduated and I have yet to get any jobs. At the time I was seeking new experiences because I wanted to expand my resume, but now I'm realizing that I need to find a balance between doing work that I'm emotionally invested in but also gain new experiences. I also feel like I should be past unpaid internships - I've done two since graduating, both of which I love, but I'm realizing that maybe it's time for a change? I don't know what to do. Especially since I'm in the midst of interviewing for one internship that I'm actually passionate about and is paid. I want to accept the internship if I get it, but I know I can't take on the workload. I will say for one, I signed no paperwork so I can back out easily, it'll be messy but quick. The other one will be messy though because I signed a contract. I don't know I'm at such a loss right now."

2422,Is this considered insubordination?,careerguidance,"My job has me trained to do things of a role that's a grade above me. So a while back I asked for a raise or promotion and they told me no. So two people in that role left at the same time. My manager begged me to apply for one of those roles. I reluctantly did it and got passed over for a freaking role that I am trained to do!!!! The role I am a ""bail out"" for. Literally she told me to apply yesterday and announced today we have 2 new people on our team. Furthermore, I asked her did they fill that role. She claimed to not know but yet just yesterday she told me that she was the one doing interviews for it!!! So much bs to even name. 

Point is, if I tell them I will no longer do that other role without compensation, is that insubordination? I am stressed out to the core at this place and I have been actively looking for a new place. They have blocked me from roles outside of my dept (it is like an unspoken secret that this happens)."

2424,How do I balance chasing career opportunities and burnout?,careerguidance,"Hey folks, I’m looking for advice on how to balance chasing career opportunities and not burning out. I want to thank you in advance for your advice.

Context: I am in my mid-20s, currently in a high-impact role at a large tech company, and I’ve been in this role for 6 months. I cannot even explain how happy I was when I got the offer because it checks all the boxes of everything I’ve ever wanted in my role. At previous workplaces, I did similar work but at a smaller scale and feel very grateful to be in my current role at this stage of my career. The work is both challenging and enjoyable (IMO anyway) and the work culture is good. I usually work 10 hours a day which is okay for my current lifestyle. I get compensated well and see myself growing at this company.

The opportunity: At the end of last year, my manager got promoted and at a 1:1 shortly after, they mentioned that they see a lot of potential in me and want me to step into their old shoes. My manager was at a director level and did strategic level work, exploring new opportunities. I currently do lower-level strategy work independently and thoroughly enjoy it so this pivot in my role will put me on an even steeper career trajectory. This is the type of role that I thought I would end up in closer to the end of my career and I am ecstatic that this opportunity has arisen.

Here’s the problem: I feel like I’m already giving 95% effort at work and I don’t feel ready for this role. I’ve always been in the belief that I should never be the one who says no to career growth and that attitude got me to where I am today. With this new pivot in my role, I foresee longer hours and even more stress in my day-to-day life. 


How do I prevent myself from burning out? I have already set boundaries for work e.g. no meetings before 8am (we all work in different timezones), no work stuff on my phone, and dedicated lunch breaks."

2426,"Girlfriend is feeling stuck in her career, any advice?",careerguidance,"Hey guys, just looking for some tips and guidance I can relay back to my girlfriend. 

We live in Australia and she has an honours degree in Psychology from the UK. She has almost 10 years experience in child/ adolescent psychology and learning (creating and delivering educational programs for kids with autism, ADHD, etc. as well as assessing for those types of conditions). 

Her current workplace has become extremely toxic, so she is looking for a way out; either to a similar job or into a new job which ideally leverages this experience. Ideally her next step should be a step forward and not a step sideways. 

Some current limitations:
- Currently on a work sponsored visa (but will transition to a partner bridging visa in March which has the same work rights as a permanent resident)
- Non-Australian qualification, meaning it is difficult to register for accredited positions (I’m not 100% certain on this constraint but if anyone has any knowledge here it would be appreciated)
- Already paying student fees to the UK and as such, is hesitant to take on any Australian student debt

Hello!

I'm in my late 20s and I live in the south with a bachelors degree in health studies (Healthcare Management).

After college I ended up in sales and have been working remotely since early 2020. I switched companies once for better benefits and higher income, but I realized that I started to dread all the online meetings and having to interact with people through the screen and do everything on the computer. I feel burned out and struggle to find motivation even with daily physical activity and clean eating and good sleeping.

I am open to moving anywhere in the US, or travelling, and would love to have an outdoor job. I would really appreciate if you could share your story if you made a drastic career change and you feel satisfied with your job. Ideally the job would need to pay $60k+.

I considered joining State Police or similar LE position in a state like MN, ideally somewhere rural.

I look forward to reading about your career moves."

2431,Coming back to work from Sabbatical &amp; PTSD?,careerguidance,"Some background info:

I’ve been in IT for 17 years. 

Unlike many in 2020, I really thrived in my career as a Sr. Systems Engineer for an IT company I was working for. 

For reasons I won’t go into, I had an accident in January 2021 that triggered some substantial PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, and severe depression. 

My company and I parted ways so I could recover. 

I checked into a facility that helped me recover, get on the right medication, and the rest has been recovery from the aforementioned symptoms through counseling, pushing myself in uncomfortable situations, journaling, etc. 

It’s been nearly a year, and I’ve felt more normal than I have in a very long time. 

My question:

How do I go about explaining a nearly year long gap in an otherwise lengthy (14 page) resume?

Obviously explaining what I just explained is off the table as it’s not professional nor, frankly, anyone’s business. 

I’d like to hear from some of you that have either gone through something similar or know someone who has and how you (or they) navigated a sensitive issue. 

Thank you for reading. 😊"

2434,The best path to take for my career?,careerguidance," I want to start off by apologizing for how long this will be, I just want to provide as much detail as I can.

Currently, I am a senior in college(20M) who will soon be starting my final(maybe) semester. I am majoring in computer information systems and have a very solid academic record and currently hold an internship at a top 5 software company in a PM-type role. I believe I have a full-time position waiting for me after I graduate. I am not too crazy about the position but it's not the worst. Now I could stop here, graduate, stay at my company and call it a day but I also have the option to stay in school for a second degree. This second degree would keep me in school for the summer &amp; fall semesters. It would also cost me very little money as I would still qualify for assistance as I technically wouldn't have 1 bachelor's degree yet. On the flip-side, my GPA will likely drop and this will delay my career progression. I mention the GPA thing since I've considered going for an MBA down the road given my academic/career background. I'm also keeping into consideration that the job market is hot right now and it may cool off if I stay in school much longer.

I think I consider this option as quite frankly, I'm afraid. I think to myself 'will I be able to do something that I enjoy?'. I'm afraid I won't like life outside of school and maybe I won't be able to find a job I will like. Or perhaps I won't like my degree and ill wish I did something else.

I've summarized my options to these(there may be more, please let me know):

\-Graduate on time, stay with current company

\-Graduate on time, find a new job

\-Delay graduation, go for another business degree at my university

Examples would be accounting or supply chain or management but would love to hear any recommendations!

As for the second-degree idea, there isn't anything in particular that I'm passionate or extremely interested in. I'm someone who needs to actually try something out to see if they like it so it would just be a speculative pick. I think I like the idea of having something to fall back on but I also don't want to be wasting my time if I'm already employable and my salary wouldn't be boosted. This probably doesn't make sense, I'm just spitting out all my thoughts at this point haha

For the much wiser that are reading this, please share your thoughts/opinions, I really appreciate anyone who is willing to talk this out with me :)"

2436,Am I doing this right?,careerguidance,"Hey
So I don't want to bore anyone with specific industry details but I don't know what's wrong with me.
Let's say I find myself studying in college towards a some specific career field. I never imagined myself in such this particular path  but hey, you make do with what life throws you.

 Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the current path. I actually enjoy it to some degree but I don't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. Now before college, I've initiated a number of failed stuff(eg. starting a club, an acapella group, a business, etc). With all these experiences, I have realized the real thing I'd rather spend maybe my entire life doing is creating and building systems and stuff like that. And yeah, I realize I can't do that if I stay on my current career path. 2 years ago, I started taking online courses on the actual stuff I want to do (building and creating). But the thing is.....

I want to be obsessed about what I want to do. Like night dreaming about success obsessed. But that's not happening. I don't understand. I mean occasion obsessiveness comes but its occasional. Is this how passions are supposed to work? Is this other one of my to-fail projects? What's going on?"
2437,"Career switch, worth it or no?",careerguidance,"New to this group! So I'm going through a moment of clarity on my career and I want to act on it but still unsure as I have a lot of anxiety about making big changes. I have completed some college for my Early Childhood Education degree but after working with children for roughly 5 years I'm beginning so second guess of this is what I want. I get horrible burnout by the end of the week as I'm working 7 days nonstop (my first days off in about a month are tomorrow and Saturday, yikes, I know) and while I'm working I notice I don't have that pep anymore. After seeing an ad from a university I think that maybe pursuing the arts degree I've always wanted would be a good idea now. A bachelor's in graphic design is what I would be pursuing and I just want to know if I should just pull the trigger? TIA."

2444,Anyone just anxious all the time because of work?,careerguidance,"I (26M) have been working account management/customer success type roles since I graduated in 2017. Currently a Customer Success Manager at a CRM company. 

My first job was as a sales coordinator. I was only asked to do repetitive, quiet work; so maybe that’s why I was able to coast for 3 years (no promotions for ANYBODY though)? Barely had meetings, account managers I supported were down to keep our communication on email. Could easily flip the switch and not think about work after 5pm and on weekends.

Skip to the present - I’m in an unnecessary amount of meetings. I find myself imploding before client calls/internal huddles even though the conversations usually end up being generic, almost scripted lol. 

I fucking hate this anxiety. Sometimes it literally starts to make me sweat and breathe funny. And now, there’s nothing I can do to flip the switch off; I’m thinking about work almost all the time and at the worst times over the weekends.

It’s so obvious I’m not cut out for this. I just can’t do this type of corporate job. Maybe a different type of role would change things but I think I just hate people lol. Find everyone to be intimidating in some way. Even though I’m ready to chew them out if needed.

I started my current role (3rd since graduating) in November and I’m already ready to quit. Saved up to last a year.

What jobs, maybe even career lol, are quiet. Email being the preferred method of communication."
2445,"Lost 20M, need help deciding major and career?",careerguidance,"I have no idea what I'm doing or what I want. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Political Science with a minor in Philosophy. I have changed my major and career goals so many times since I began college. I entered college as an English major wanting to be an author, then switched to Psychology wanting to be a psychologist, then Economics to be a financial planner, and now I settled on Political Science and Philosophy to become a lawyer or a professor. But I am looking back at my old majors and career ideas and still interested in them all. So, I am looking to get outside advice about which major and career would be a good choice. And how to gain experience without fully committing to one major or career over another?

I decided on my current major of political science as my *resume* pushes me in that direction. I participated in different government programs with my city and county on multiple occasions. I also decided on political science, as I am interested in learning about the forms of government, civics, state of nature theories, and jurisprudence. I am currently thinking about becoming a lawyer as I have been interested in becoming one since high school and my sister is currently in law school, and listening to her talk about her courses has made me interested. But I am more interested in being a law professor rather than an actual attorney.

I have also decided on doing philosophy as I am very interested in metaphysical and existential topics. My main interests I would say is researching and thinking about existentialism, theology, ethics, and cosmology. Since being a philosopher is a career of the past, I thought about being a professor. As I said, I am interested in theoretical topics and feel being a professor would allow me to incorporate them into my career through teaching and research. Right now I am liking the idea - if possible - of becoming a professor and hopefully teaching both law and philosophy courses.

I switched to psychology as I am interested in personality, consciousness, human psyche, and forensic psychology. I like learning about why people act the way they do and what causes our personality. I thought about becoming a psychologist as I liked the idea of being self-employed and helping others. Though I wanted to be a counseling psychologist full time, I thought about working with the court system doing forensic psychology on the side as it seems interesting, and one of my favorite teachers thought I would do great as one. But I decided against becoming a counseling psychologist - even though I want to help others - I know I would be overwhelmed and couldn't handle seeing others emotional and in pain all day, everyday. But, even though I am worried about being overwhelmed, I feel I could help patients with anxiety and phobias rather than more impactful disorders such as depression.

I was an economics major as I did well in my introduction to economic courses: macro and micro, and I am pretty good at math. I am also interested in personal finance such as investing, saving, retirement, and planning for future goals. I thought about becoming a financial planner as I liked being able to be self employed and the perks which come with it. I also thought it would be nice helping others with their finances. But I decided against it as I realized I am only interested in personal finance rather than the economy on a whole, and I know I couldn't sleep at night with the thought of messing up or giving wrong advice to my clients. But I am still interested in finance and think that it would be a good career. I also feel worrying about giving wrong advice isn't a reason to not do it, rather worrying about making a mistake, forces me to work hard."

2451,Which job should I take: att or 1st source bank?,careerguidance,"Which company is better to work for? I got a job offer from Att Tuesday and accepted, but they aren’t starting me until the 24th so I figured I’d go ahead and keep my interviews just to see what they had to offer. Now it seems 1st Source bank might make me an offer. I’ve never worked in sales or at a bank, so I was wondering which is better.

What I know so far:
Att - $15.71 to start + commission 
Benefits kick in at 90 days
Sign on bonus if I last a year
Located in the town where I live
Training in-store
Union
Lowest on the totem pole so nights and weekends are a must
Lots of turn over

1st Source- $14.50 to start
Benefits at 90 days
Opportunities to move up + earn certifications
Located 40 minutes away from where I live
Training in a city 3 hours away for a week
Have to pass quizzes and tests to keep job
Steady schedule mostly M-F and some Saturdays

I don’t mind doing the extra work for 1st source if it’s worth it. I like that att pays more and is close to where I live, but I’m concerned with the high level of turn over. I’m transitioning from fast food management and I don’t have much experience in either field. Which would be better?"
2452,I’m trying to pivot careers but I’m not sure what my next steps should be. Any advice?,careerguidance,"Last November I was fired from my graphic design job.

After working at a few agencies I feel incredibly burnt out and the thought of diving back into that environment fills me with anxiety. 

Before I was fired from my last job I got really into Python and started teaching myself how to code. I love it! It feels like the perfect mix of creative problem solving and logic. The only problem is the time I’d need to invest to develop the skills I need (I’m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end)

2453,"Broad degree, no idea what to apply for. Whats the easiest path to decent money?",careerguidance,"Hello! Just a little bit of background about me: Late 20s, I have experience working in Warehousing and currently work doing basic repetitive tasks in the insurance industry. Last year I completed a Bachelors in Business Management and have yet to really put it to use. I have zero passion for what I want to do for a career, all I want is to be able to afford a decent apartment and have enough PTO to spend more time outside hiking and going on trips.

I have no idea what my degree really qualifies me for, to me its just a broad degree and only checks that little box for HR so they don't shitcan my resume the second they see it. I spent the summer wrongly hoping something would open at my work just because I love the benefits and the fact that an internal move will be easier, without really applying to anything. I am at the point where I am just applying to anything remotely interesting just for the extra money. I also spent the whole summer thinking my passion would just fly into my face and I'd figure it all out, going back for a different degree or masters. I have been thinking about going back to school for Accounting, I know I would hate how monotonous the job is, but I would only need to complete 8 or so classes before I had that second degree and I am thinking it would be easier to find a job in that, and I would also have a defined career path. Is this a silly idea?

So far I have applied for: Operations Management, a few HR positions and a Project Management Job. Waiting to hear back on all of them. I live in a HCOL area and rent is only going up and I feel the pressure in my pockets. Its just so hard to figure out WHAT to apply for with my minimal experience. I do low level tasks anyone with a heartbeat would be able to complete. Any guidance would be appreciated. I do want to toss it out there I am an INTJ and have some pretty nasty chronic depression.

2457,How should I bring up the issues I’m having at my new job to my supervisor?,careerguidance,"I started a new job about two months ago. In the description section it said “this is a developmental position” to essentially get me to an Analyst position. The job I applied to was described as being an Analyst Trainee. 

Since I’ve started my job, I’ve done 0 actual analyst work. My trainer is a super Karen who freely admits that I’m there to do the work she doesn’t want to do. I tried to bring up the fact that she refuses to train me to my supervisor, but he kind of brushed it off saying that it was too early to get deep into training. 

The final straw for me happened today when she said that I will now be the assistant for her and another employee. Analyst Assistant is an official job position at my job, and much different than my current position which is sort of entry level or “trainee” position. She’s already instructed the current assistant to stop doing her work and assign it all to me. 

It’s not that I flat out refuse to do assistant work, I just don’t want to get stuck in the role. Every other person that started in my position has moved up to analyst (but that’s only been about 6-7 people since they created this role), but not a single person in the Analyst Assistant role has been promoted to Analyst. An Analyst makes around $30,000 more per year than an Analyst Assistant.

I’ve sort of had a gut feeling that they advertised my job as a Trainee position to get someone excited for the Analyst position, but were always planning on sticking the new person in the Analyst Assistant role. No other person that’s started as a Trainee has gotten put the in Assistant role, so I’m super confused on why I would be the first. 

Becoming an Analyst is sort of a dream job for me, so it’s not something I want to just give up on. However, if my current position hadn’t have said it was a “developmental role that leads to becoming an Analyst”, I wouldn’t have applied.

How do you think I should bring this up to my supervisor? I’m not sure how to say that I don’t want to get stuck in the Analyst Assistant role without sounding entitled, but it’s really not the job I signed up for and not the job promised to me in my interview."

2459,What careers are there that might help me translate my skills and passions into a lifelong income?,careerguidance,"My 30's are coming up far too soon and I've spent most of my adult life unable to find a comfortable career path.

**Summary:**

I'm a passionate dungeon master enamoured with fantasy, a writer and a worldbuilder, I could see myself devoting my life to this, but I can't see it paying the bills. I'm also someone who feels most comfortable in dynamic environments where my work doesn't become repetitive. I'm comfortable and have plenty of experience taking on leadership roles, and I have a mind for business and business management... what the heck should I do? What career opportunities are there for me?

**Hobbies:**

I'm an avid hobbyist: I play dungeons and dragons twice weekly. I am the dungeon master of my own campaigns, I worldbuild extensively to improve the immersion for my players. I also write short stories and I play a plethora of video games. A career in the gaming industry is something I'd be interested in, but I don't know where to even start.

**Work Experience:**

The jobs I've worked so far have been largely uninteresting. I've worked produce in a grocery store, sorted cans at a recycling depot, waitressed at a restaurant and answered phones at a call center. In every job I've worked I've taken on a leadership role, either officially or unofficially, and always find myself best at handling complex or crisis situations. Any excuse to break the monotony of the setting and I'm right on top of it. The days where things go wrong that stress most people out are my favourite days where I get to take the reigns and solve complex issues.

**Education:**

I tried going to university for programming right out of high school, but life got in the way and I never finished. I let it slip away from me in part because of how my life was going, but also in part because I lacked any creative freedom in my assignments. It gave me a glimpse into the life of a programmer working for a big company: A stifling experience of creating only what the client wants and never going outside the boundaries.

Since then I've forgotten most of what I learned regarding programming.

I'm currently attending university with no real goal. I'm just doing general studies and taking whatever classes interest me in hopes of finding my passion. I've done some business management studies, some accounting, and just for fun, I've been taking creative writing classes.

Business management has been smooth sailing so far. I'm good in leadership roles and with numbers. Accounting has been... hard to focus on. It's not complicated by any means, it's just not interesting. Creative writing has been something I've found a deep passion for. I wanted to be a writer when I was a kid, and it seems it's a flame I can't escape.

**Conclusion:**

I  really feel lost. I need a job, I need to choose my educational  direction, and if I ignored my passion for fantasy and writing I'd be a  fool. I'm really not aware of a broad range of jobs that could even  combine my skillset and interest, let alone trying to choose one.  Please, all suggestions are welcome."
2460,What's the best career suited towards my skills/ personality/ character?,careerguidance,"I work as an auditor(1.4 years in retail / administration), I have a computer science degree (I hated programming, hence why I never went the Programming route).

A) Analytical (I work well with numbers, and this makes up 80% of my current role.)

B) I'm not numerate (I've always hated maths) but get by with tasks at hand

C) Resilient (I'm not a quitter ) Decent at multi tasking, handles pressure well 

D) VERY focused/Immersed (my focus is almost intense )

E) moderately Investigative

The stress of trying to learn everything rapidly, and sending stuff out to the clients has been pretty challenging. Training was okay, but general idea was that to make mistakes and to learn from them. Which is great at first, but the job has so many gray areas and mistakes build up. Today I got a comment stating that my work was terrible and he would take back all the positive things he said about me.

2470,"Recently got hired to my dream company, but a severe injury prior to my start date is making the job impossible. What should I do?",careerguidance,"I find myself in a little bit of a situation here. I had been trying to get a job at the university I attended for years since I’ve graduated. I finally got hired in November of last year, and quit my position in local government I’ve held for three years. My start date was supposed to be 12/14, but three days prior, I herniated my L5/S1 disc. I was taken by ambulance to the ER and have been in constant chronic pain since.

I called up my manager after this occurred and they postponed my start date to 01/04. I believed that three weeks would have been enough time to get back on my feet, per one doctor’s timeline. However by the time January the 4th rolled around I was still in severe pain and just recently begun driving short distances again.

The campus was closed for a week due to the holidays, and they reopened the day before I started, and I decided that I would show up to my first day on the job. Also, I was facing tremendous pressure from my family to show up regardless of my pain. I regret doing this, and should have called and seen whether I could postpone or resign from the position. But I didn’t want to give up this dream opportunity, so I stupidly decided to go through with it.

I’m on my third day of work. I already had to ask for time off to meet with a neurosurgeon, and his outlook is pretty grim - 4-6 months of conservative treatment such as physical therapy and epidural, or surgery, which would take roughly 2 months to recover from.

My employer is absolutely wonderful and they’re trying their best to accommodate me but I’m in way too much pain to pull off 8 hour shifts. It’s a desk job and sitting is absolutely terrible. I can’t stand for more than a couple hours at a time without needing to lay down. This decision to show up to my first day of work has turned a dream opportunity into a nightmare.

I’m currently walking around my office in an extreme amount of pain on my break not sure how to move forward here. All I know is I can’t do it. Not in this current state.

What would be the best way to broach the topic of resignation without damaging my standing with my employer (in the event another opportunity arises in the future, or I decide to pursue higher graduate education here)?

2472,How can I get a job teaching college-level English without any previous classroom teaching experience?,careerguidance,"I have an M.A. in English, and I want to teach college-level English. My long-term goal is to earn my Ph.D. in Literature so that I may teach advanced English courses, but I want to teach freshman English for a while to earn some experience before I go for another degree. As a graduate student, I didn't do an assistantship to gain teaching experience. However, as an undergraduate, I worked for two years as an English and Spanish tutor for college freshmen. My problem is that most job ads I find list ""classroom teaching experience"" as one of the requirements. Since tutoring doesn't count as classroom teaching experience, I feel like I am doomed to fail in my search for a teaching position. Is it possible to get a teaching job without having classroom teaching experience? If so, how should I go about marketing myself to potential employers so that I can at least get an interview?

I made a CV, but it is so empty. I try to emphasize my academic achievements as a student, but my tutoring experience is all I have to list in the ""Work Experience"" section. As an undergraduate, I graduated *magna cum laude*, won a couple of scholarships for my performance in the Foreign Languages and Literatures program, and wrote a 30-page honors thesis. As a graduate student, I did research on narrative in visual and mixed media, with a focus on graphic novels and film. Do these things matter at all on a CV when applying for an academic job? I just finished graduate school a month ago, so I haven't had time to send out a ton of applications, but I feel so lost and don't even know where to begin.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

2476,"Based on my career goals, should I add a minor?",careerguidance,"I am majoring in public health and ultimately want to work with data. I don’t care if its necessarily public health data or not, although my background may help me do so. 

I have 2 full semesters left and a small, third semester consisting of 4 credits before I graduate. I’m wondering if I should add a minor in information systems as that covers some python and SQL. It would make my third semester another full semester, and tack on a fourth, full semester before I graduate. 

I’ve learned some SQL on a healthcare data udemy course which I have enjoyed and felt like I learned from. I am willing to keep learning database/analyzing/visualizing tools through similar resources. 

I’m essentially wondering if I should continue learning SQL, and start learning tools like Python and Tableau through cheaper, online resources, or if it’s worth it learn these through a minor which will take more time and money. Im also curious as to how my choice in this could affect my career and job prospects. 

Thank you in advance!"
2477,I want to get into high finance (investment banking) but I got a low GPA. Is there hope?,careerguidance,"I started college earlier as an electrical engineering major. I had a lack of motivation and it wasn't easy as I struggled with the material. I switched on later to finance and I am thinking about possibly working in an investment bank as asset management or investment banking. The main problem is that I have a 2.8 GPA due to lack of motivation and depression in my first two years. I am about to start my third year of college. I am willing and determined to get straight A for the next few years of university. If I can also get 2 or 3 minors and get straight A in all of the classes, I can possibly get my GPA up to a 3.4 or 3.5. I already went to WallStreetOasis and looked at the resume template. I am preparing to send out my resume to most finance internships to get my foot in the door. I just created my LinkedIn account and I started to already send messages and emails to alumni to reach out. I already have two contacts at an investment bank and I am talking with them next week. I am planning to speak with some professors about the field next when I resume classes. It will take some hard work but I am willing to put in the effort. Is there any hope for me?"
2478,Company is restructuring and I have two options. What would you do?,careerguidance,"Been working on the demand side of my company for exactly a year and have created a good reputation for myself. My manager is leaving and as a result, I am being reshuffled but I have the option of choosing. 

Here are my options:

1) Move to a different organization within the overall company. My vertical that I am in is being reshuffled there: less stable, more upside 

PROS
Upward mobility since they are getting the vertical and I would be the subject expert
Have a better understanding and insights into how our clients run their company 
Have more impact since everyone is newer

CONS
Don’t know the people well and have to rebuild my reputation — worked with these people before but have gotten my toes stepped on so I have a slight bias from them 
Loss of my support system since I’m moving organizations 
Role is either AM or Sales, not like my current role which is a hybrid of both, which I like 
May be siloed within this role 

2) Stay at current company under another manager: more stable, less upside 

PROS
Have built up relationships and have a good rep as a hard worker — close to home 
Get to learn the other side of the business (supply) so more well rounded within my industry 
Get to keep the AM and Sales aspect of both 

CONS
Recently acquired a company that joined the team I would be joining
This manager isn’t as generous at promotions (not to say option 1 would be either) 
Would have to restart and relearn and not be the “expert” on this team — would be 3rd most senior and may have less understanding than some of the newer people joining from the acquired company.


Learned that I am not good with huge changes and has been really stressing me out. I want to lean towards option 2 bc it is comfortable but option 1 may have more upside, although not guaranteed.


Let me know your thoughts! Welcome any advice. Thank you!!"

I’m new to this community but have been beyond stressed recently and am looking for any sort of guidance. I’m 23 about 3/4 the way done with college and I’ve decided it’s just simply not for me. I come from a family of fairly successful people in the tech field and they do not understand why I just can’t do college anymore and think I’m headed towards failure and at this point I think they may be right. 
So in short I am asking what would be a good field to look into? A good job for me to get now to find something? I love sports, am fairly creative, but I just haven’t found something that I feel is my calling and was wondering if anyone could give me some sort of idea I could get into."

2485,"How to handle work with people who ""want to change the world""?",careerguidance," Hello,

I\`m 29 years old working as Team/Technical Lead in an IT company. I give my best as I can and my personal life could provide. For now, I don't have any serious problems/miscommunication with the clients or my boss.

However, for the last year, I work also with people which are around the beginning of their careers and one way or another I should manage them. I\`m really glad that I\`m able to work with such team(s). On the other hand, since these people are still young and, I can only envy for that, they require more work than actually, they should do. This includes working on day to date basis, including specific company projects and also internal for specific team tools.

I have already talked with the people separately regarding the balance between personal life and work and there is something called ""burnout"" and my experience with this bad behaviour. Unfortunately, since the current situation, we don't have the possibility in case that the team(s) want to go out for a beer/dinner to hang out and talk more about this topic.

We had a discussion with my manager and he said that these people ""want to change the world"" and as soon as they understood that this is not the right way to do it, will be better for them. And my responsibility is to take for this without forcing. Also to stop the possible competition into the teams.

Such examples are:

* Based on discussion with clients I say that work could be finished in X days. These people from the team say to me that they can do it much faster. And they actually do it faster, when working for 12 hours a day.
* Accepting changes in the last minutes without discussion or at least my knowedge.

These people are valuable for the team(s) and the company. They are making a really good job. On the other hand, all team members should understand that rest is not so bad thing and start thinking more ""selfish"". I have already discussed these topics with all of them several times, but from time to time there is again this self-proof behaviour.

Can you please share how you handle such a situation?"

2487,Is 28 too late to start a new career?,careerguidance,"I'm 28, originally from South Africa, have a degree in mechanical engineering, work as a building services engineer (HVAC design), earning £50k.

I've worked on prestigious projects in London like Battersea Power Station etc but I just don't feel challenged or mentally stimulated in my job. I also feel like its a bit of a dead end job, if I keep pushing I could end up as a director by the age of say 45 but that would only put me at £80k pa max. which can hardly afford a 1 bed flat in London. meanwhile my friends in finance and IT are earning this sort of salary at the age of 30.

I know I enjoy programming, I do hobbyist machine learning in python and have 2 years of academic experience in the language at uni so considering starting a job as a junior python developer.

2490,I’ve decided on a career change after 15 years. How do I get the experience needed to get the job before I can get the job?,careerguidance,"I live in the UK, I’m a registered nurse and have been for 15 years.  I finally realised I want to work with animals.  I’ve done personality tests that support my new career choice and it’s something that I’ve wanted to do for years.

The problem I’m facing is that, while there are jobs out there for veterinary nurses (lots of local vacancies), you can only train to be a veterinary nurse if you already have a vet practice that will give you an apprenticeship. Most places have limited student/volunteer spaces that are already filled.

I know being a people nurse will have plenty of transferable skills and I’ve been contacting every practice I can find in the county I live.  I’m happy to start at the bottom and work my way up, but they want people with animal experience for even the most basic jobs.

I’m putting myself through some online animal care courses so that I can prove I’m committed and have something relevant on my CV.  If I don’t manage to find a job in this sector I have applied to go back to college to study animal care.

I’d really like to know if anyone has any advice or experience of breaking into a profession like this?  How do i get the experience to get the job before getting the job?"
2491,"How rightfully angry, if at all, should I be over getting my job application rejected at the very last minute? What are the possible, good reasons for that happening?",careerguidance,"Just for some context, this happened some time in the past, around 1-2 years ago in fact. It's a question that's been at the back of my mind and only now I decided to ask about it.

I remembered that I once applied to a company. It seemed everything was going well from the interviews and tests. Eventually they gave me forms that I needed to fill out that included stuff like expected salary, earliest start date, previous company referenced and whatnot. I was excited since those are generally very good signs that I got the job. Except how one week later, with little to no explanation, they rejected me from the position, with the only reason being cited as a vague ""circumstances have changed"" or something has changed.

Now, I have two questions in my mind, what could possibly be the cause of candidates getting rejected from a job at the last stretch possible when all is seemingly going well? And how rightfully angry should I be over the incident? I admit it became both a pet peeve and triggering fear for me."

They liked me so much that they are creating a lower-credential-required job for me.

I'm sure many of you may have heard of a similar scenario, but I really need some sound input to ease my mind on my decision I'll be making.

Long Story, short. I have been heavily interviewing with Company A and Company B. Company B is my dream company that I want to work for. Company B said that I did not get the position sadly, so I accepted an offer from Company A. I'm due to start working for Company A next week. This morning, Company B called me and said the reason I didn't get the position was because I was overqualified. They ended up opening a higher position for me and gave me an offer!! I told the recruiter that I accepted a position with another company, but that since they were my dream company, I'm going to retract working for Company A. Am I in the wrong for this? Will I suffer repercussions?"
