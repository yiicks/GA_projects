0,"YSK know that there is a finite amount of money in the world and the more some have, the less others get",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:  We're in a period where the wealthy keep getting wealthier and the poor are getting poorer, due to inflation and the stagnate wage growth the last 20-40 years. While true, the money we use today is fiat, it's value is always in flux and more can be printed, there's still a definite amount of it out there and the more individuals and corporations hoard onto themselves, the less there is for the rest of us. This basic fact seems to have been forgotten by people over the years due to the influence of Reaganomics and conservative ideologies. 

We've glamorized billionaires as a model of success and evidence that not only does the capitalist/American dream work, but that anyone can achieve it too and have ignored the fact that they are, in fact, cheating the rest of us out of our fair share. We should be outraged by this, that's why you should know."
1,"YSK picking a proper name for children is crucial &amp; can be life-changing, don't take it lightly, don't pick stupid or ""fun"" ones",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK? According to studies, picking names have a long-lasting effect on children's lives as they grow up. They can even affect school admissions &amp; employment.

A child's name is not a social statement or a cool experiment, it's permanent &amp; goes to become part of their core identity &amp; self-worth.

Our names can shape our psyche &amp; are reminders of how much our parents care about us. It can vastly hurt or improve life experiences.

2,"YSK: if you scratch the cornea of one eye, be prepared to be completely blind in both eyes for at least a day.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK? Because you will not be prepared for it when it happens. You might think ""ow, my eye hurts"" and then the next moment, you are blind. If you try to open your eyes, the pain of it will cripple you. They become so incredibly light sensitive that it will cause you to believe that you may actually be blind. But you won't be, unless it's for real bad.

Just tie a shirt around your head and lie down. You can't make it better by trying to look. Darkness is your best friend when you have a scratched cornea. The doctor couldn't help me. Rest my friends. It will pass.

It's crazy that even the slightest scratch can cause temporary blindness, so for all of you who ride motorcycles without sealed goggles, read this and take heed before you find out the hard way. 

Also, wait until you can see again and then look at your eyeball. You will actually be able to see the scratch. It's so crazy looking."

4,YSK: There is a quick painless way to discharge static electricity,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: If you search for static discharge keychain on Amazon or other shopping services (I don't want to get the post removed for posting a product link or I would), you can find little keychains which are basically tiny resistors encased in plastic that you hold your finger on for a couple of seconds to discharge the static without any shock.

Some people can be sensitive to shocks, and it can be harmful to sensitive electronics. I work in computers, and it is much easier to carry one of these around as opposed to an antistatic strap. It doesn't replace an antistatic strap for working on a computer for a long time, but if I'm just replacing a memory module in a laptop or something that takes less than a minute of actually touching a PCB, it's handy."

YSK that upon learning you owe to the IRS, you can mail your tax return with a statement saying you are aware of the amount you owe, and what you can offer in installments. Up to a few weeks later you will receive an installment plan agreement from the IRS, sometimes for significantly less per month than what you had offered.

Not only is this act of donating food protected by state Good Samaritan laws but is also protected by the [Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1791)

31,"YSK: Pitbulls were bred to eat babies, and shouldn’t be kept as pets.",YouShouldKnow,"Why ysk: so that your babies don’t get eaten by pitbulls.

Pit bulls, or baby eating mongrels as they’re more commonly known, were bred initially for hunting, but later included breeding to hunt and eat human babies.

The timing that the breeding switched from hunting game to hunting babies occurred in the early 1900’s in the United States, where evil dog fighters, such as Michael Vick, promoted the hunting of babies."

Why ysk: Whether you throw your trash in the regular trash or the recycling bin, animals and specifically cats might get hurt by it while looking for food. First of all, if you can, clean with water the remaining food/liquid from your trash. 

Metal cans in particular are dangerous. Not only are they about the same size as a cats head and could get them stuck there with no air but they are also sharp at the top. So try to squash and seal your cans before you throw them. 

Would appreciate if someone chime in on what to do with glass jars. Breaking them might be dangerous too so not sure."

34,YSK that adequate heating isn't just about comfort. Keeping your place too cold to save money on heating can cost you way more in the long run.,YouShouldKnow,"Reposted to add the why YSK header.

**NOTE:** This is mainly for first-time property owners, property managers, and landlords who are likely getting inundated with heating complaints this time of year. 

It may seem cost-effective to just put a sweater on (or to ignore your tenants until it gets warmer), but if you live in a climate with big temperature shifts, it's very likely that your property REQUIRES adequate heating as part of regular maintenance. And I don't mean by law. I mean by physics.

**Why you should know/ Why YSK:** Dwellings need to be adequately heated to promote proper moisture evaporation. If it's too cold, water just hangs out and never dries out completely which can lead to rotted out floors, rusty pipes, and mould. It can also rot out insulation, which will in turn lead to even higher heating costs since it'll take more energy to heat the same space.

For those of you like me who are renting and have no control over the heat: keep a log of the daily temperature to protect yourselves if your landlords try to blame you or charge you for repairs due to things like water damage. 

And if you have particularly shitty landlords (again like me), try to store things in dry, safe places away from walls and closet corners. That's where condensation and mould tend to build up and it can ruin your stuff pretty fast--we're talking one or two weeks of bad heating. I lost all my childhood books and stuffed animals because our landlords nickel-and-dimed our heat and told us to ""put on a sweater"" even when we showed them our sweaty, mouldy walls and I don't wish that experience on anyone else."
35,YSK: Download PDF versions of all of your better appliances and save them to an “Owner’s Manuals” folder on your computer/mobile device.,YouShouldKnow,"
I found a home for about 10 years now, and during that time, I purchased a lot of different appliances and devices. Every now and then, I have an issue with one of them, and I have to try to find the owners manual. At a certain point I realized I could just consolidate everything digidly, so I created a file folder on my computer specifically four PDF versions of owners manuals, then I went and found all the ones that I owned… lawn,owners, washer/dryers, TVs, SoundBars, etc. 

It’s save me a lot of time and energy having everything available in one place for when I need it. This tip is pretty basic, but hopefully it helps somebody.

36,"YSK shrink-flation is just as bad as inflation, but sometimes harder to identify!",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Shrink-flation occurs when manufacturers and retailers  keep prices the same but give you less product while the consumer is not necessarily aware that they are receiving less product. 

Watch out for slightly redesigned packaging for stuff you normally buy. If the package says ""new look"" or ""new packaging"", this could be a tipoff. 

For example, my family buys a particularly brand of hand soap. It cost $2.99 for a 12oz bottle for the last couple of years. Then a few weeks ago, I noticed the bottle was now 11.4oz and the price stayed the same. The ""new improved package"" was meant to hide the fact that you are receiving less product for your money!"

55,"YSK: LED light bulbs use a negligible amount of electricity, so you can relax and let go of that nagging feeling that you need to turn off the lights.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Those of us who grew up with incandescent light bulbs were instilled with the habit of turning off lights when you're not using them, but change in technology brings change in economics, so now that habit is what I would call irrational and perhaps even bad.

The point isn't to promote waste, but rather, I know that people nag each other over it, and many even feel guilty when leaving the lights on. In reality, it is completely unnecessary to ever go out of your way to turn off a light. e.g. if you left the house to go to the store or on vacation but you forgot to turn off a light or two; or if you are already in bed and you forgot to turn off a downstairs light.

Some people say to me ""every bit saved counts"" or ""lights off is better for the environment."" The best way to illustrate my point is to put it into perspective with numbers.

A 7 watt bulb is equivalent to \~40w to \~60w incandescent. How much does it really cost to leave a light on constantly?

7w LED @ $0.24 per KwH (Los Angeles, high electricity cost)

|24 hours|30 days|365 days|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$0.04|$1.21|$14.72|

&amp;#x200B;

7w LED @ $0.10 per KwH (US average)

|24 hours|30 days|365 days|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$0.02|$0.72|$6.13|

&amp;#x200B;

How many 7w lightbulbs equivalent are your typical home appliances?

&amp;#x200B;

|Appliance = 7w LEDs|Fridge 180w = 25.7 lights|Washer 500w = 71.4 lights|
|:-|:-|:-|
|50"" TV 70w = 10 lights|Mid Gaming PC + peripherals while gaming 600w = 85.7 lights|Dryer 800w = 114.3 lights|
|Vacuum 1400w = 200 lights|Microwave 1200w = 171 lights|Dishwasher 2200w = 314.3 lights|
|Clothes Iron 3000w = 418.6 lights|Hairdryer 1800w = 257 lights||

*In other words, if you play a game on your PC for 1 hour, that is enough electricity to power a light bulb for 3.6 days.*

Note: If you are heating your house with a thermostat and electric heating, then the electricity you use in devices is practically free, since they substitute the electricity use of your heater as they warm your house. Energy used = heat.

Besides removing any time or inconvenience spent on going back to turn off a light, there are other benefits to leaving some lights on at night. For example: a lit house may be a deterrent for burglars, and can prevent you from tripping or stepping on objects if you wake up and walk around. My house is dimly lit at night with various 0.5w to 3w lights. I will pay less than $10 over a year for that.

Some people may not find this info useful, but I know for a fact a lot of people are still anal about turning lights off. If you want to conserve electricity, you should skip the lights and find another home appliance to curb your usage of."

This can result in dark photos which lack detail. Using your flash in these situations - known as fill flash - can improve your photos by providing light to things which are in shadow. It's also a good idea to look at your background to make sure you don't have a bright source of light behind your subject - even reflected light, as this can cause a shorter exposure which loses detail, or it can cause undesirable glare on your subject."

67,"YSK: Referring to undocumented immigrants as “illegals” or “illegal aliens” is perpetuating them being seen in a negative light, and most of them do not deserve that label.",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK**: because its unfairly labeling an entire group of people with a word that has really negative connotations. 

**My explanation**: 

I just cringe every-time I see or hear someone refer to undocumented immigrants as “illegals” or “illegal aliens”. 

It may seem inconsequential, but I think its a pretty big deal, and I’d like to explain why. If you are someone who uses these phrases without thinking, this is for you. Not trying to chastise. Just trying to offer perspective on something you may have not thought about before. 

I understand that they are technically in the country illegally, but the better way to phrase it is *undocumented*. 

Using the word “illegal” is perpetuating the idea that they are criminals. It may not be intentional, but when we hear the word illegal, the words “criminal” and “wrong” are a very easy and automatic connotation. Its subtly removing the humanity from them by labeling their entire existence as “illegal”.

Most of them are not criminals. Most of them are good people, trying to build better lives for their families. They have strong values the same as other people in this country. The only crime they are guilty of is entering a country illegally. But that is not reflective of their values as people, parents, children, employees, etc. Is it not a crime you might commit if you were in their shoes? If it meant a better life for your family?

Also, many of them are children, who were brought over by their families without a choice. Imagine being a child that was brought over here, outside of your control, and hearing people refer to you and your family as illegal aliens. Heartbreaking.

They aren’t aliens, they are *people*. The only difference is that they don’t have US documentation. I think changing the way we refer to people in this situation can help remove a lot of the connotations that pop in one’s head when hearing the word “illegals”. There are so many of them who come over here and strive to just be good and contributing members of society. Strive to raise good families. Be good employees. 

So for anyone out there reading this, next time you refer to a group of people as “illegals”, think twice about what you’re really saying. 

I live in a border town and personally know a lot of people in this situation. But a lot of people who live in other parts of the country may have never met an undocumented person. Its easy for them, being so removed, to place these people into a box of “illegal/criminal/dirty”. To dehumanize them subconsciously. 

In reality, they are simply undocumented. And unfortunately the system makes it very difficult to gain documentation. 

Everything we can do to remove the stigma from these people is a good thing. 

Thats all, thank you for reading."

4. if your charger isn't sitting flush on a flat, solid surface, there is a chance that bugs may crawl under and inside of it.
5. lots of household insects (silverfish, cockroaches, earwigs, etc) are attracted to heat, water, and dark spaces. 
6. German cockroaches in particular like to live in warm, humid places near food or moisture, which is why they're typically found in the kitchens and bathrooms of homes and restaurants. if they're not eating food, they will look for things like soap and toothpaste, but they've also been known to chew on electronic wires. this species is smaller, has a lighter brown color, and breeds faster than the American cockroach. what you think are baby cockroaches may actually be German ones. 

how to prevent infestations:

1. place your charger on a flat, solid surface.
2. dry and wipe your toothbrush after every use. I like to turn it on quickly to let the bristles shake off excess water. 
3. consider only plugging in your charger when you need to use it and/or keeping it in a room that doesn't get humid.
4. wipe down your charger base any time you see that it's wet.
5. sanitize your toothbrush head, body, and charger base regularly, especially if you see gunk building up.
6. make sure counters and floors are clear of food crumbs and liquids. 
7. look for and seal all small cracks in your home, especially in humid areas.
8. ask an exterminator to check if there's any reason you should be concerned - they know the common areas and signs of infestations and can help give you more specific preventative tips.

note: there's not usually a need to worry about roaches if you don't already have a known problem in or near your home. if you do suspect cockroaches, you should keep an eye out for their poop which looks like finely ground black pepper or can be more cylinder in shape and length, depending on the species.

I kept my toothbrush on the top tier of a rolling cart in my bedroom with the charger always plugged in and the toothbrush on top. the cart has mesh-like ""breathable"" shelves, which the roaches were easily able to go through and directly inside the charger. when I found small unidentifiable bugs crawling on my dresser, I couldn't figure out where they were coming from since I had just deep-cleaned my whole house, including hard-to-reach spots. but then I saw a couple of small bugs crawling around the cart and I knew it had to be related to my toothbrush. the only way I could remove all of the bugs inside the charger was by unplugging it and placing it up under a running faucet. at least a dozen small ones were flushed out, and just when I thought I got them all, 3-4 larger ones that were holding on came out. suffice to say, my toothbrush isn't staying in my room anymore."
83,"YSK - in a survival situation, cook things in water instead of fire",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK - you will get the best and the most of nutrients if you cook anything you forage, hunt or fish in the wild in some water instead of grilling it on the fire, it is also the most efficient way to share equally with someone in case you're not alone.
We often see on surviving shows and movies people putting food directly in the fire or eating it raw, that's the worst way to cook nutritionally efficient for surviving. If you have the choice to cook everything in a pot of water (or whatever container you have available) do it that way, joints in the bones and the skin will break into collagen and that will be more easily and quickly absorbed by your body, organs that are rich in vitamins and minerals will also break up and infuse the broth with nutrition, plants and mushrooms are often more safe and easily digested when cooked in water, and you can always use this method to mush everything evenly so you can share better (it's much more difficult to share a fish or a lizard in two equal pieces when it's roasted). Unripe fruits can be hard to digest and even dangerous to eat when not ripe, cooking them is also the best practice if you find any. Roasted vegetables or meat can get burnt pieces and these burnt bits are just gone calories and nutrition, whatever gets burned is not used by our body and in a survival situation, any calories, carbs and protein are vital. Surely not the tastiest, but definitely the most efficient."

Legally your employer cannot retaliate against you for this. And if they did you could take it to court.

Sick time is for any instance in which you cannot make it to work wether it be, death of a family member, caring for a family member, if you are sick, if you need a mental health day, really anything along those lines is enough to justify using your sick time."

By knowing multiple ways out of a building/restaurant/concert/crowd/etc. it will undoubtedly save your life and your loved ones in an emergency.  The majority of people will all go towards the only way they know out - the same way they walked in…it’s instinctive and when that happens - bottle necks/trampling/death will likely result - and no one escapes.

The first thing I do when I’m out with my spouse/children, and walk into a place, is scan every single way out of that fucking place.  It takes all of 15/20 seconds…but I know exactly where we are all headed in an emergency situation.

Over 100 people died and many of them were found piled on top of each other at the main entrance, inside the club.  They never made it out.  I realize the smoke made things incredibly difficult - but after reading this post - and if you’re ever in a similar situation - the moment you sense danger - you will likely exit out a back/side door unlike 100s of others there with you.

From then I realised that one must go for accuracy and not speed, I learned that if you go for speed you will loose the accuracy which consequently won't help in increasing your speed. Go for accuracy while learning a skill, the speed will increase naturally and gradually.

Explaining the results: our memory develops and in general, the older we get, the more we value our memories. Material gifts don't tend to create many fun memories compared to experience-based ones.

There are various [other studies](https://cognisera.com/what-present-to-buy-for-a-friend/) that explore the topic. But the conclusion is the same in almost all of them - most people derive more happiness from experience-based gifts and purchases.

196,YSK: Gaslighting is more common than you think,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Gaslighting is a common thing and sometimes knowing that someone is trying to gaslight you can save your nerves and mental health.

The term itself comes from the 1944 film ""GasLight"". But what does it mean?
According to the British Dictionary of Neurological Terms 4th Edition (A Dictionary of Neurological Signs 2016), gaslight is ""an attempt by one of the partners to expose the other as mentally unhealthy."" This is exactly what happens in this Oscar-winning film. But the term covers a much larger range of situations, and its display in marital relations is only one of the numerous possible options.

Each of us at least once encountered gaslighting in our life, but many do not even realize its pathological nature. Someone was subjected to gaslighting by parents, someone by teachers or someone higher in rank, by superiors or even friends. And someone, perhaps not realizing that, was the initiator of this phenomenon.

So, what is gaslighting exactly?

It is a psychological manipulation in which a person or a group of people influence the consciousness of another person/group of people to sow doubt in them about their adequacy, perception of the world, memory to make them lose confidence in themselves and their significance. This is a type of violence that exposes a person or a group of people to such strong and systematic influence by the aggressor that they cease to believe in their worth and independence and are forced to obey the will of another since they appear before them as a self-proclaimed authority.

Some illustrative examples of gaslighting in culture and life:
·       Margarita Pavlovna and Khobotov from the 1982 soviet movie «Pokrovsky Gate»;

·       Mother Gotel and Rapunzel from the 2010 cartoon «Tangled»;

·       Tom and Rachel from the 2016 film ""The Girl on the Train"";

·       The Dursley family and Harry Potter from the «Harry Potter» series of books and films

·       Dictatorship and people, in the examples from literature (O'Brien and Winston Smith of George Orwell's 1984) or reality;

·       Known to everyone hazing in the army;

·       Numerous examples of domestic violence, shown in the media every day.

Gaslighting does not always have a conscious goal and is the aggressor’s malicious intent. Often, the initiator does not even understand that he is causing psychological violence, which, however, does not deprive them of responsibility. The victim loses self-confidence, develops the so-called ""learned helplessness"" under the influence of this pressure. It’s a state in which the individual does not attempt to improve his life, even if he has such an opportunity.

Eleven signs of gaslighting:
·       Straight lies. They lie to you right in the face without any embarrassment.

·       Denying your own words or actions, even if there is evidence.

·       They use the most important things against you. Do you love your children? You shouldn't have had them. Happy with the new haircut? It doesn’t fit. Trying to love yourself? To begin with, lose weight, get fit, take care of your personality. Self-love is impossible, you are so far from the ideal.

·       Pressure gradually increases, you are exhausted slowly, but surely.

·       The actions of the aggressor do not correspond to their words.

·       Rare spontaneous praise and support that does not allow you to be very detached or leave the aggressor. It’s like a bone thrown to a dog. Most often, the praise is associated with something that benefits the aggressor.

·       You are confused by the idea that the aggressor is the only source of stability for you.

·       The aggressor projects his flaws and fears on you, forcing you to defend yourself. There can be cheating, addictions, negative character traits. The aggressor will outweigh all their sins on you, forcing you to prove your innocence.

·       The aggressor is pitting others against you. Not necessarily directly, he can simply convince you that no one needs you or that people are using you.

·       You're told that you're mentally ill, out of your mind, crazy.

·       You are convinced that everyone around you is lying"
197,"YSK: Cheap induction stove tops don't produce constant heat, instead they produce heat for a short duration and then stop in order to match the intensity that you set it to",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

If you are using thin cookware, i.e. non cast-iron skillets, the stove-top will heat the bottom of the skillet/pan quickly, and then it will stop heating it for some time. The high difference in temperature, even if only momentarily, will likely burn your food, unless there is something that absorbs and slowly dissipates the heat, i.e. dampens the throughput and instead of a burst, the heat transfer becomes continuous.

What can you do about it?

You can use thicker cookware that absorb and retain the heat, and so when it dissipates, it does so in a constant stream instead of a burst. You can use the induction stove-top to cook pasta or soups as the water acts as a dampener. You can invest in a better stove-top that produces constant heat."

201,YSK Call your utilities and and monthly expenditure on a yearly basis for price check,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: many companies have a yearly increase for whatever reason they come up with and this price is negotiable. Many of them don’t let you know it’s happened and many of those will lower it in seconds if you call them out on it. 

I just got off the phone with my garbage service and they dropped my bill by $8 within 30 seconds when I got to the billing department. They had it all ready to go and said the reason they don’t give you that price is because “it’s only a call in promotion and not a regular sale”. This was only after I realized my bill was up $5 for the last couple months with no notice to me other than my invoice being higher. 

They know it’s dirty and they don’t care. Just remember that it isn’t the fault of the customer service rep. Just play nice and tell them that you don’t agree with what’s happening, tell them you want your bill lowered or you’ll go somewhere else, and then wish them a good day. They’ve got to deal with a lot of nasty people and they appreciate a decent one as often as they can get it"
202,"YSK: Dogs need ""lower energy"" love too",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: I have observed that humans default to giving ""high energy"" love to dogs. By that I mean rough love, playful, ruffling their fur, big scritches, saying ""WHO'S A GOOD BOY/GIRL"" and getting on the ground to zoomie with dogs. But every single dog I have met seems to really enjoy quiet, slow love. A light pat on their head. Soft and slow scritches. Talking softly. Try it; you'll see how instantly most dogs adapt to it. I bring this up in YSK because I'm actually a bit sad for dogs.... I think many of them crave this slow love and don't get it."

218,YSK You can manually refill many inkjet printer cartridges and considerably extend their life and cost effectiveness,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: There  are some threads on reddit recently about inkjet printer cartridges and how they are very expensive. The below methods will help save cost of printing and owning an inkjet printer.
  
There are 2 methods I know of, both require buying ink bottles for your respective cartridge model. For HP, You can buy official HP ink (GT52 for colors, GT53XL for b/w) which are quite affordable.

1) The simple method involves using a syringe and injecting the cartridge with ink in the right hole, dabbing out the excess and let it sit for about 10 minutes.

2) The slightly more difficult one is by using something called as Ciss kit. This is like an IV infusion with saline bottle. The kit comes with inktanks with tubes that you need to plug into the cartridge. 

You can google both approaches and there are YouTube videos as well.

You need to know that a standard cartridge will not last for more than ~1000 pages. You cannot indefinitely use a single cartridge, so with either method, you will need to buy new cartridge after a limit.

Some printer models apparently won't allow you to reuse a cartridge if it detects to be empty. So re-fill before it's fully empty.

You may need to buy an additional tool called a cartridge suction tool. It's a small plastic contraption with a a slightly large syringe and is used to remove any air gaps and also helps in unblocking cartridges that were not used in a while.

While laser printers may seem like a nobrainer, they cannot print in color and also more expensive. A basic hp inkjet printer is quite cheap in comparison and can print in color. With a bit of elbow grease, an inkjet printer can be very affordable.

Hope this helps!"

239,"YSK Alcohol is a Group 1 Carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer even in small amounts",YouShouldKnow,"All alcoholic drinks, including red and white wine, beer, and liquor, are linked with cancer. The more you drink, the higher your cancer risk. If you have cancer, drinking alcohol will accelerate the metastasis.

Why YSK? Because the health benefits of alcohol are untrue, unfounded &amp; quite similar to the bogus health benefits of cigarettes (that the tobacco industry bought &amp; paid for) or how the sugar industry mislead the world by shifting the blame to fats. No, red wine won't make your heart healthier, you can get the same benefits from pomegranate or grape juice without the risk of cancer.

When you drink alcohol, your body breaks it down into a chemical called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde damages your DNA and prevents your body from repairing the damage. DNA is the cell’s “instruction manual” that controls a cell’s normal growth and function. When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumour.

Big alcohol is a multi-trillion industry &amp; will do anything in its power to sell you the prestige &amp; amazing effects of alcohol. They have been misleading the public for years.

Today, nobody denies smoking causing cancer but that was quite a different story a few decades ago.


There is strong undeniable evidence of alcohol (even in moderation) causing cancer, including but not limited to:

Esophageal cancer: Alcohol consumption at any level is associated with an increased risk of a type of esophageal cancer called esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Head and neck cancer: Moderate to heavy alcohol consumption is associated with higher risks of certain head and neck cancers.

Liver cancer: Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with approximately 2-fold increased risks of two types of liver cancer

Breast cancer: Epidemiologic studies have consistently found an increased risk of breast cancer with increasing alcohol intake. 

Colorectal cancer: Moderate to heavy alcohol consumption is associated with 1.2- to 1.5-fold increased risks of cancers of the colon and rectum compared with no alcohol consumption.

263,"YSK: If your iPhone gets stolen DO NOT answer any SMS texts from Apple, go directly to the Apple Store",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: When most people’s phones are stolen they panic and become desperate. This makes them vulnerable to hackers that steal private info, your address, etc. Most people aren’t aware of the lengths hackers go to in order to steal your passwords (mine created a fake website that looked exactly like the official Apple website).

My iPhone was stolen by a taxi driver. After I recovered the SIM card, I received a text from “Apple” telling me that my phone had been used in the last 2 hours, and that another SIM card was being used for my phone. I thought it was the thief so I followed the instructions and clicked the link which looked pretty legit and looked like the official Apple website. I entered my iCloud and phone password, but nothing showed up. 

Afterwards I went to the apple store and was told that the text message wasn’t actually from apple. The hacker had created a website identical to the apple website and removed my iCloud account from the phone, there was no way to get it back since i couldn’t track it on find my iPhone.

The apple employee told me that I should have:
1) called the cops about my missing phone immediately 
2) went directly to the apple store after the phone was stolen
3) never have inputted private information into a random website
To be fair, the website address was something like iCloud.webstore.com, it looked pretty legit to me
Now the hacker has most of my private info, including my full name, address, billing info, phone number, they probably could have accessed all my personal photos and figured out everything about me. I changed my iCloud password, don’t worry."

And isn’t randomly unlocked when it feels like it.,YouShouldKnow,"YSK, that if you live on a college campus or an apartment with a card/code door, that you should check if the door actually locks.


Why YSK. Not knowing your door is unlocked and doing nothing about it could let any unauthorized person into your room at any time. My worst fear was this happening while I was asleep.


During my last semester of college my dorm room door had a major glitch. I happened to notice that my door was not actually locking and literally anyone could walk in any time they pleased. With no card or code at all. 

If you have one of these doors I highly recommend to check if the door is actually locking every time you go into your room. You do not want someone else noticing before you do."

These 3 bureaus allow you to ""freeze"" your reports, so that nobody can look at them and therefore nobody can take credit out in your name.

My kids got laptops for Christmas, they are under 8yrs so I wanted to be sure they couldn't access mature content. After installing Norton Family on their computers I tried stress testing Nortons filters and was surprised to find it was not filtering properly through Chromes incognito mode.

After troubleshooting with a Norton tech agent we found that incognito mode was disabling the browsers extensions. So I uninstalled Chrome and blocked google, switched their default browser to Edge as their private browser does not disable the extensions.

287,"YSK In the US, it is illegal for for-profit companies to offer unpaid internships unless a very strict set of criteria is met.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Companies will often try to exploit folks who are desperate to get into a field of work. They will offer unpaid internships when they absolutely should be paying you. 

Unpaid internships MUST be for the benefit and education of the intern, not the company to be legal.

1. The intern is aware that they will be uncompensated.
2. Training is comparable to training received at an educational institution.
3. The internship is tied to the intern's current educational program (e.g., with academic credit).
4. The internship accommodates that intern's academic calendar.
5. The internship is limited to the period during which the intern receives beneficial learning.
6. The intern's work complements (not replaces) existing employees' work, while still providing beneficial learning.
7. It is understood that the internship does not provide entitlement to a job at its conclusion.

Non-profit organizations like charities, the government, and schools can offer unpaid internships that do not meet these qualifications.

Many many unscrupulous companies offer illegal unpaid internships when they should be paying you. If you did an unpaid internship that did not meet these criteria (and many dont!), it may be worth talking to a lawyer or reporting the company to the Department of Labor."

It’s a pretty devastating thing to have happen to you and many of them couldn’t salvage the relationship (understandably so). Taking anything that alters your hormones will most likely have a unpredictable impact on your dating and sex life, and while this pales in comparison to some of the negative physical health problems birth control can cause, it’s still a risk you should be informed of.

298,YSK Uber Eats is safer than Doordash,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: I haven't seen this covered anywhere but if you're concerned about safety you should order from Uber Eats and NOT Doordash. 

Uber started as rideshare and had to develop a background check process to keep rapists and creeps off their platform (usually at the application step). The downside of getting in a cab with a rapist can be terminal so they got really good at it. 

When Uber started uber eats, they leveraged the rideshare background check process.

On the flip side, Doordash never did rideshare and safety isn't as big an issue in delivery and so it is WAAAY easier for rapists and creeps to get onto their platform bc people can easily create fake ssn's and keep applying until they get accepted. 

The cynical view is that Doordash never got good at background checks because the same process that keeps out rapists and creeps also keeps out undocumented immigrants. By keeping their background process shitty they can get all the undocumented immigrants labor to cut costs and offer cheaper deliveries. Uber never had this option bc you can't say ""rapists not ok for rideshare but ok for delivery""

Really understand why no one has called this out. You've been warned"

It's a $40 fee that you can literally get out of paying by paying now instead of with your return.

Left half, right half, left half, right half.

361,YSK: Keeping a wooden spoon balanced across the top of a boiling pan will keep the water from boiling over,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: when making things like tea, rice, lentil soup, or pasta, it becomes tiring to have to stand and watch the pot to ensure it doesn’t boil over (and inconvenient and stress-inducing if you have to step away for a few seconds). Laying a wooden spoon across the top of the pan allows for the spoon to absorb some of the heat, break the surface tension of the bubbles, and prevent the difficult-to-clean mess!"

365,YSK: if you regularly have dreams about your teeth falling out you may be grinding your teeth in your sleep,YouShouldKnow,"TL;DR: stop reading dream interpreter websites and talk to your dentist if you have nightly dreams about your teeth falling out. 

Like many of you, I had almost daily teeth-falling-out dreams. There’s tons of pseudo science about “it could mean you are nervous about [something]” out there, but let’s talk actual reasons and solutions from my experience. 

A few years ago, I had to get a dental splint put in to adjust my bite. In my sleep, I ground my teeth so hard that I broke the splint. Turns out, I clench and grind like a motherfucker in my sleep. So, my dentist made me a nice mouth guard. 

Since that day 6 years ago, the only times I have teeth-falling-out dreams are when I am not wearing my night guard. This thing literally changed my life and I don’t wake up in a panic anymore."

368,"YSK that if you’re a minor in California (or certain other states) and discuss issues related to sexting with a therapist, they are required by law to report you to authorities for producing/viewing CP.",YouShouldKnow,"California law A.B. 1775 flew in under the radar a few years ago but has some pretty messed up consequences people should know about. Basically, it means in CA mandatory reporting laws for therapists are very strict. The laws were challenged by some lawyers and mental health counselors who argued it would prevent a lot of people from seeking help, and ultimately lead to more serious issues down the road for people…but the judge upheld them anyway.

Aside from catching adult offenders seeking treatment, it also means that if you’re a teenager and mention to your therapist about an issue involving sexting that involves nude images (say they were leaked by an ex to your school), they must report you. 

This is just in CA but I’m sure other states have similar laws.  That doesn’t mean your therapist definitely will report you…but it means that they are potentially legally liable if they don’t. 

Why YSK: If you or a loved one is seeking counseling for a sexting related issue…be very careful what you say to the therapist

369,YSK: How to spank and choke your partner properly,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: these things, done incorrectly, can be painful, unpleasant and even dangerous. Knowing how to do them properly will give you more confidence and your partner more enjoyment! 

For choking: the key is to not crush the esophagus but to cut off oxygen supply to the brain by applying light pressure to the carotid arteries. Make a V shape with your hand and lightly squeeze the sides of the neck, rather than pushing downwards into the windpipe. And of course, you should still be careful and work out with your partner a way to know when they’ve had enough. 

For spanking: for those of us that like to be spanked but don’t like searing pain, the key is to spank with an open palm downwards on the upper/middle part of the buttocks. This is a bit harder to describe but if you spank straight into the gluteal muscles like he’s prepared to do in [this picture](https://imgur.com/a/iibw7zD) it can really hurt. Instead, spank with a downward motion, [like such](https://imgur.com/a/E2OO2jN). If you do like BDSM and want a bit more pain, then by all means vary it up with how you spank, but for folks who want a little spice but mostly nice, give the method I described a shot!"

401,"YSK that an extension cord with a lower amperage rating than your house outlet, does not necessarily have a fuse or breaker protecting it.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: The breakers in your house do not ""know"" what the rating of the extension cord is, or what outlet it is plugged into. They can only protect you and your home from either a dead short, or an overload of your actual home wiring itself. The breakers cannot tell if you've plugged something like a space heater into an extension cord that is too small for such a load.

&amp;#x200B;

The maximum amperage of the cord should be embossed in the rubber, somewhere along the length of it, possibly more than once. That, or the wire gauge should be embossed in the rubber of the cord. If the embossed writing is difficult to read for you or anyone else who might use the cord, you or someone else should make a clearer label for said cord, and attach it to the cord. 

&amp;#x200B;

A 16 Gauge cord can handle 13 Amps if it's less than 50 feet long, and 10 amps if it's longer than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

A 14 Gauge cord less than 50 feet long can handle 15 Amps, the maximum for a normal, single outlet (which the breaker would ""enforce"" anyway) but a 12 Gauge cord is required for a full 15 Amps, if it's more than 50 feet long. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there's no rating anywhere on the cord that is legible, I recommend throwing it away and buying a brand that does have a visible current rating on it. A 15 amp cord should be safe for almost anything, because most outlets are connected to a 15 amp breaker, so overloading that would blow the breaker in the building anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, although NEC clearly doesn't require extension cords to be protected against overcurrent, I would think that having such a feature might increase the sales of said cord if they boasted/advertised the protection features enough."

405,YSK to never search for a domain name you want to purchase using a Domain Registrar,YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK:** Domain Registrars such as [GoDaddy.com](https://GoDaddy.com) and [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) have been known to be shady and purchase websites people search for shortly after they search for them.

To purchase a website bought by a Domain Registrar you will need to go to a bidding war with them. Bidding typically starts at $199 and to submit an offer you typically need to use an agent to do the bidding on your behalf, starting at $19.99 per bid and the agent also requires 20% of the purchase amount as commission.

**Solution**  
Using a neutral domain registration lookup tool like [https://whois.icann.org/en](https://whois.icann.org/en), you can safely verify if the domain exists, who if anyone has purchased it and when. Then if you decide to purchase it, do it in one lookup on the same day."

407,YSK: Take pictures of your phone trade-in devices for full account credit,YouShouldKnow,"You’ve all had that experience of phone upgrade promos offering good trade-in credit of phones or tablets on your cellphone provider. You sign the contract, you get your new phone, and set it up. Excitedly you get the return box in the mail and wipe your old phone and disable the find my phone etc. You toss it in the bag and ship it back. 2 weeks later you get a credit on your account for a fraction of what was offered on the contract. WTF!?!?

Why YSK: If you take pictures with your new phone of your old trade-in phone operating in perfect working order and in good condition with no cracked screen or any defects next to your trade in form with account number and imei, your carrier will have no choice but to offer you full trade in credit that was offered per contract. All you need to do is call your carrier and let them know you have these documents/photos and make a note on the account. When you call back the next day they will offer you full value.

Obviously, your phone/device needs to be in excellent condition or you won’t be able to receive full credit. You also need to be in good order with your billing on your account. If you have a bad payment history this won’t happen and or if switching to new carriers they probably won’t help you out.

Best of luck getting full trade-in credit for your devices. CYA!"

-You hear a weird and loud sound coming from a corner of your car (from the plastic bottle being crinkled between the tire and car wheel well).

-You get out of the car real quick to do a quick inspection of what that sound was.

-Odds are you left the engine running since you expect it to be a super quick get-in-get-out inspection in the parking lot.

- The few seconds you're outside of the car, the thief jumps in your car and locks the doors and drives away.

You wouldn't even know what's happening by the time the thief has your car in drive.

If you find a plastic bottle wedged between your tire and wheel well, call the police, do not get in your car, or just drive away knowing what the sound is with your doors locked."

Please take a moment to try to calibrate this--if their hearing is sensitive enough that they can hear an insect's steps, imagine what fireworks must sound like?


Do you know a veteran?
Did you know that the sound of fireworks often triggers post-traumatic flashbacks of gunfire, explosives, and the blood, death, dismemberment, violence, and chaos they may have witnessed and/or directly experienced?
Flashbacks caused by these sensory triggers force them to relive the horror all over again. They can snowball into intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, (more) nightmares, thoughts of suicide, or suicidal behavior.


Do you know someone with autism?
Did you know that they tend to experience a range of sensory challenges? 
Among other examples, their hearing is often amplified and even quiet, background-type noise can be overwhelming and over-stimulating.


Do you know anyone who has survived long-term trauma?
People (or animals) who have survived abusive homes often become anxious, agitated, hypervigilant, and scared as a result of loud noises. Any sudden, dramatically loud sound can trigger reliving of traumatic memories involving screaming, yelling, crashing, banging, breaking, beatings, and more.

451,"YSK: How to smoke cannabis for your first time, so you have a comfortable experience. (If you're above the legal age in a legal state.)",YouShouldKnow,"WHY YSK: Many people have a great time the first time they try cannabis, but every so often someone [smokes more than they need](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/rrtk2j/tifu_by_smoking_weed_for_the_first_time_and/?sort=top) unintentionally and it can be a very uncomfortable experience. For your first time smoking cannabis (in a legal state, of a legal age) don't just have the same amount that the people around you are having. Everyone has a different tolerance, and can comfortably enjoy different amounts. 

Here's a basic rundown of how you want to approach your first experience:

* Go to a legal dispensary that has good ratings on Google, Yelp!, and other rating sites.
* Purchase a high quality ""preroll"" (joint) of low THC Indica. This is a mellow type of weed. They will know what it means.
* Go home and schedule a time when you don't have to do anything but relax for 24 hours.
* Have one or two close friends with you who aren't the type to mess with you when you're high.
* Get snacks, a couple of your favorite movies, non-alcoholic drinks, and some of your favorite music ready to go.
* Light the joint and take ONE hit. Inhale lightly and not too deep. Exhale and make a mental note of the size of the cloud. It should be small and you shouldn't cough too much.
* Drink some water, let the joint go out.
* Set a timer for 15 minutes, and listen to music, talk, and have a snack. Relax and enjoy yourself. Don't worry about if you are high or not high, just enjoy hanging out.
* After 15 minutes, see how you feel. 
* If you are high, you should feel relaxed, or mildly excited. Your mind might wander and you might find normal things funny. Enjoy it! 
* If you are not high, try taking another ""sip"" from the joint. Not too much! It's better to underdo it than to overdo it.
* Set the timer again for 15 minutes. 
* Repeat as desired, until you feel a mild and comfortable high.

Don't worry about finishing the joint, just consume as much as is comfortable. Don't try to get SUPER high, you just want to get to know your tolerance and how much cannabis is a good balance for you. If you didn't get high again, try again when you have some more time to dedicate to the experience. 

If you start to feel anxiety, put your favorite movie on, listen to some chill music, enjoy a snack, or do something else that will productively occupy your mind. Don't drive. Go for a walk if you can, a little exercise can help with anxiety too.

454,"YSK: ""2 Factor Authentication"" isn't just limited to receiving a verification code by email or SMS (inconvenient). You can easily receive the code from installed software/apps on the same device you're logging in from - and it is more secure! The code changes periodically (usually every 30 secs).",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:  Up until a few weeks ago, I thought just this. I think the term ""2FA"" is being widely misunderstood.  I think when service providers like google started making people use their phones or emails to receive verification, that became what I conceived as ""2FA"" in its entirety. This method was always a chore and I learnt to brush over any mention of 2FA when setting up accounts/apps after that.  Investing in crypto is what eventually made me do the research and correct this misconception.

Cybersecurity is difficult to communicate about. The ones who actively research cybersecurity practices don't discuss it with, and inform the people around them who don't; as it is a private matter."
455,"YSK before you rant to a friend, you can first ask him/her if he’s emotionally available to accommodate you.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: It’s a good way of checking if someone’s actually alright at the moment to listen to you. 

A friend recently reached out to me and asked if I was emotionally available to listen to her because she needed to unpack some issues and just wanted to vent out, and that if I was not, it was alright. I thought it was good way of checking if someone was “fit” to hear us out at the moment.

It’s different from asking someone “do you have the time/are you busy, can we talk?” Because they can have the time but they may not have the right headspace or is emotionally not okay. They can also be a bit busy but would be willing to hear you out.

We may not always realize it, but when we rant to someone, they actually carry a part of it. They can feel its weight, too, and it can also be emotionally taxing for them. And so it would be better to check on them first. 

Note that I don’t intend to discourage people from reaching out. I know that sometimes all we need is a shoulder to cry on. This is just a suggestion to check on the other person first. We can’t always tell what others are going through- sometimes they might even have it worse. It would be helpful for them if we give them a heads up and let them reserve their right to decline if ever they weren’t okay at the moment."

I was under this impression until a few weeks back myself. I think by forcing me to use the email and sms thing over and over (like Google did as a default verification method), I thought that was all there was to this term ""2FA"".

461,"YSK about uBlock Origin, Sponsorblock &amp; Bypass Paywalls Clean",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: There are so many people who are still using the internet without any sort of adblocker, even though I personally can't fathom how considering how bad things have become these days online. Not just with ads but also trackers and other annoyances such as sponsored parts of videos or paywalls on news sites.

Seriously, we should all be using uBlock Origin and also uBO instead of Adblock or Adblock Plus as those are sellouts with their ""acceptable ads"" policies. uBO is also far more efficient at bypassing those anti adblock messages. As a side note, Google Chrome and its derivatives such as Edge will soon be introducing Manifest v3 which will limit the effectiveness of adblockers so it might be wise to switch to Firefox before then. No surprise considering how Google is primarily an advertising company so of course they don't like adblockers. (DuckDuckGo is an excellent alternative btw)

You should also know about Sponsorblock which automatically skips sponsored parts of YouTube videos. Sponsorblock is also integrated in 3rd party YouTube clients such as YouTube Vanced and NewPipe x Sponsorblock from the IzzyOnDroid F-Droid repo. (I personally prefer the latter as it's open source and thus more privacy friendly) Sadly, those apps aren't available on iOS cause guess what, Google/YouTube blackmailed Apple to remove 3rd party YouTube apps from their App Store to sell you YouTube Premium instead and unlike Android you can't side load any of those apps. You can still download Sponsorblock from the App Store and watch YouTube in Safari though. Alternatively you can also use a 3rd party YouTube website called Piped Kavin Rocks which also automatically blocks ads and sponsors.

There's also Bypass Paywalls Clean which can bypass paywalls on news websites. Keep in mind that those paywalled articles are still publicly available for everyone, usually as part of their x amount of free articles per month which this extension can increase to infinite, so there shouldn't be any legal concerns with it. Also use the clean version as the regular version comes with Google Analytics."

I do both techniques just in case.

My nose is hella sensitive to dust and powders so I sneeze quite often and I hate it, so here's some I know that works well for me.

Sneezing is just one of your body’s many natural defense mechanisms. It helps prevent irritants from making their way further into your respiratory system, where they can cause potentially serious problems.

Is it bad to not sneeze? Well healthline says ""In general, trying stifle a sneeze likely won’t cause major bodily harm. However, while doing so, your eardrums may pop, or you may have a slight feeling of pressure in your face or forehead"" - Stacy R. Sampson, DO

Also, remember to always cover you nose or your mouth when sneezing to prevent the tiny particles from catching everywhere plus it's respectful to do so.

Swimmers will learn how to seal off their nasal passage from their throat/lungs by tightening a muscle near the connection point. Doing this stops any water going up the nose from entering the throat when diving, which is obviously very useful for swimming.

But this sealing ability has another use. When the nasal passage is sealed off, you also can't smell anything. At all. This seal is stronger than any other nose plugging method.
Pulling any bad smell-based pranks on a swimmer would be a waste of time because, unlike a typical person, they can just seal their nose as soon as they notice the bad smell. They will also be immune to farts.

TLDR: Do NOT waste your time trying to pull any smell-based pranks on swimmers! They'll most likely be immune to bad smells."

One involes non-profit organizations that ostensibly educate and support the public, then turn around and ""sell"" referrals to treatment centers for personal profit (sometimes laundered as ""you can buy advertising on our website"" or ""you can sponsor our events financially for a certain number of patients per quarter""). This violates numerous ethical rules and means that the community organizations that claim to be working in the public interest, but some who benefit from the non-profit tax status also have thriving direct income from selling your loved ones into centers that may not be the right fit for their needs. 

The other more publicized version are the internal and external ""treatment loops"" maintained between inpatient and outpatient centers. Essentially either one owner holds both centers, and they count on you relapsing in the lower level of care to send you back up to the higher level of care in and endless loop that ends in your death, or the inpatient facility partners with a series of poorly-run outpatient facilities or ""recovery homes"" that are either negligently or in some cases intentionally inviting relapse, then rushing you back through to the feeder system of inpatient care...is you survive. 

Why YSK: Because this can contribute to the relapse and death of you or a loved one. America has a complicated and complex issue with addiction, but this aspect is a part of the problem, and is not nearly well-known enough and gets ignored when the federal government releases millions of dollars in new grants, that then sadly often go to those exact organizations that continue to prop up more of the same kinds of cyclical addiction factories. 

Please, do your own research and choose the centers that specialize in the kids of issues you or your loved one suffer from, and don't blindly take the word of community outreach personnel that may or may not have a vested financial interest in treatment failure.

But then I see them just slicing garlic into millimeter slices in their recipe. Right.. found the problem. Most of the time the recipe is fine, you just have to prepare the garlic correctly in order to get the right amount of flavor you want. 

The way you chop and cook garlic affects the strength of the flavor in your dish. If you mince garlic you will release much more flavor compared to slices. A paste will be even stronger (you get a paste by mincing first and then smearing it on the cutting board using a knife repeatedly)

Basically, the general technique to follow is to start towards the middle of the path and follow an outward spiral until you reach the edge, keeping the chute facing outwards the entire time.

For instance, if you start just to the right of center with the chute facing rightwards, you'll send the snow either off the path or to a spot you haven't cleared yet. When you reach the end of that path, simply turn around and keep hugging the center-right side (what *was* the left side before you turned around). Then just keep doing that as you move outwards until you've cleared the edges of the path.

Same principal goes for sidewalks. Simply start slightly right and send it right and turn around and hug the other side."
559,YSK Costanza is an abuser who thinks his vaporwave is more important than the people in his life,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: He wanted this to be public knowledge, because he stands by it all.

This is my story. I want my words to be my own, and this was written after I finally connected all the pieces together through a lot of hard work and reflection. I was in an abusive relationship with Costanza for over a year. It took me a long time to finally realize it for what it was. Like many women in emotionally abusive relationships, the signs aren’t as clear when their partners aren’t leaving physical marks on them. Being able to physically see the wounds your partner inflicts on you is a lot easier to walk away from than when they inflict the same amount of damage to your mind and spirit. Costanza completely wore me down this past year and a half. The constant gaslighting, blatant manipulation, and verbal abuse is extremely nauseating looking back. He had convinced me that all of his actions were justified and normal, and that I was wrong to be angry with him for everything he had done. He never liked taking accountability, and I don’t think he ever genuinely has for anything. Any of it. He’s apologized for certain things, however his apologies were never genuine. They were always deployed as a tool to achieve whatever motive he had on his mind. In some cases, that was for sex, for others it was to make him feel better about himself. His intentions were never to do anything for me, it was always about him. This message will act as my final statement regarding the horrific events I’ve endured, and act as a way for me to finally reclaim some of my power back. I am not going to make any more posts about it, I do not care to get “revenge”. I am just putting this out there once. Costanza told me he stands by everything he did to me, and if that’s truly the case, he should have no problem with it being in the open. 

The first six months of us dating were relatively peaceful. In that time he allowed me to really fall for him, and I was treated with respect. Looking back, there were two signs that I should have noticed that would be a precursor as to what was to follow. The first being his constant teasing of me. Teasing is fine, but there were certain things he would say about me, whether it be regarding my appearance or so on, that I communicated hurt my feelings, and despite knowing this, he continued to anyways. Another was his inability to be completely loyal, which I really don’t want to go too far into, as it really hurts my feelings and self confidence. If you’re reading this Costanza, you know exactly what I’m referring to, constantly making me feel second fiddle. 

The real problems between us started in February 2021. I had experienced awful cramping and dizziness, and was advised by my friend to go take a pregnancy test. I took it, alone and petrified in a Target bathroom. It was positive. I contacted Costanza regarding this, and he agreed to see me. He had dumped me a couple weeks prior due to someone in his past resurfacing. We were both extremely frightened and completely stressed. We weren’t sure what had happened, and if the baby was healthy. I went to the doctor the next day, and found out that I was miscarrying. As soon as he heard the news, all of his initial concern went away, and he felt it completely over. The miscarriage was devastating to me, and extremely traumatic. It took me a week to pass all of it’s remnants, and I was in excruciating physical pain through all of it. It felt as if I was going to die, the pain was that bad. Rather than be sympathetic to me during that time, Costanza called me awful names, accused me of horrible and horrendous things, then later on went to say that he was just joking. His “jokes” included him accusing me of impregnating myself with a cum jar and him telling me that my miscarriage is “just a heavy period”. Yeah. He said that to me while I was passing the baby. My body wasn’t able to fully pass everything, and I ended up contracting sepsis. I had to go to the hospital, and when I came back, rather than support me or care, Costanza blocked me and ghosted me for a week.He did this while I was recovering, unable to move or grab myself something to eat. He left me like that, vulnerable, but not after calling me every name in the book. He had left me alone to not only deal with the postpartum depression I had been facing, but also the physical complications of a miscarriage he helped cause. He had no heart for me during that time, and I had to beg and plead with him to do anything. I had to beg him to periodically check up on me while I was passing the baby, I had to beg him to answer a phone call from my doctor, and I had to beg him to be nice to me during that time. He was just awful and downright evil to me during all of it. He prioritized himself and never went out of his way to do anything for me. I would have been better off not telling him anything about it. Strangers had offered me more support during that horrible time than he did. We argued for the next month following, and then finally went no contact for the month after that. After this period of no communication, he came to me and told me he felt a large amount of guilt towards the way he treated me during that time. I was unfortunately at a place mentally where I was very vulnerable and naive, and I fell for his trick. He promised me to make up for how he treated me throughout the miscarriage, and to give me all the support I needed. I stupidly took him back.

During our time back together, I wasn’t treated at all appropriately. Any effort that he had previously been making completely went out the window. He would notice this, and right when I started to feel crushed, he would give me a glimpse of care, and I held on to that. He did it so I would hold on. I knew I wasn’t being treated correctly, but he brainwashed me into thinking the little effort he was putting in was his best. If he took me somewhere, he would make me thank him multiple times for doing that. Through all of this, I maintained my role as his caring and loving girlfriend. I continued to write him notes and letters that I would surprise him with, cook and deliver him food, and get him gifts to make him feel special. He never did any of that for me. He had promised to take me out and get me something for our anniversary, he never did. He happily took my gift to him and just ignored something I was really looking forward to. I’m a very sentimental person, and he knows this. He called me materialistic for wanting him to write me a note, after I told him that was the best gift I could ask for. He would do this stuff a lot and it just crushed me completely over time. I didn’t feel pretty, cool, or anything enough to him. I wasn’t the person from his past, and he routinely let me know I wasn’t the apple of his eye. It hurt me so much to be in that position for so long. He didn’t let me enjoy anything. He constantly criticized everything about me, and just downright disrespected me. I tried to be sweet to him during a point where he did not have access to home cooked meals. He would tell me that he was craving certain dishes, and I took the time out of my busy day to recreate them for him. I was working and going to school full time. I had made him a bunch of food that I had given to him spaced out, and I would ask him his thoughts about every individual dish. I wanted to have his constructive feedback, as I wanted to know what to change to better make it for him. He told me that each dish was delicious and perfect. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I ended up having to drive him home after he had drank too much. I went to grab him a bottle of water from the fridge, and I saw all the food he told me he had eaten sitting there untouched, some of it starting to mold. Rather than apologize, he blamed me for everything. He claimed it was my fault because he never asked for me to do that, and completely overlooked his lies. It upset me to the point of tears, and I threw all the food out and washed all of my Tupperware. He had no respect for me, nor my time or effort. This was a common trend of his.

I ended up becoming pregnant again, despite being very safe. This time it was healthy. I was extremely freaked out at this point, and was in the middle of an inner conflict. I had not been the same since the miscarriage. It hit me really hard, and being in this situation again was my worst nightmare. I struggled a lot with guilt, and being forced with the decision of whether or not to end a healthy pregnancy was God-awful. I was terrified, and I needed Costanza’s support through this. Looking back, I wish I never told him and just ran far away from him, because his actions from this point on have hurt me like nothing else in my life has. The day I found out I was pregnant I wanted it out of me and gone, I was petrified. However, I had to wait a month for the soonest available appointment to terminate the pregnancy. As I waited for that appointment, my mind began to wander. I had suffered through so much guilt, and I truly felt that this was a second chance to make things right. I had my doubts on whether or not I wanted to go through with the abortion, and I wanted to involve Costanza in the discussion. He would not entertain any of that in the slightest. Every time I wanted to have a healthy and calm discussion regarding it, he resorted to threatening me with taking his life. He told me he would kill himself if I didn’t abort the baby. He let me know that whether or not I terminate the pregnancy was my choice, but the consequence of me not going through with it would be his blood on my hands. I was terrified of him. He presented me with the illusion of choice, but deep down we both know he didn’t give me one. He wouldn’t even allow me to have it and raise it on my own. He told me that if it was brought into this world, he’d end his life and that it would be my fault. Not only was he threatening me during this time, he also didn’t do anything to support me either. I remember one day in particular I was experiencing really bad cramping while we were hanging out together, and rather than comfort me, seeing and hearing that I was in physical pain, he chose to continue playing his video game. I had to ask him to comfort me, and he didn’t until he was able to save his place in his game. It didn't matter to him. Two days before the appointment I was dreading, he completely freaked out. I was at work, and he had started texting me. He got all crazy and started accusing me of faking my pregnancy. I had to leave work early to go to the store and take a pregnancy test for him. He told me if I didn’t he would kill himself that night. This was two days before something I was trying my hardest not to think about, already stressed out of my mind, and he had to go and hurt me right before it. Called me names, and made awful accusations. I was crushed. I went through with the abortion and have been devastated ever since. It was awful on both my mind and body, and he made it worse than it had to be.

After the abortion, he checked out. He didn’t want to talk about it with me. He just wanted to ignore it and pretend that it didn’t happen. He would ignore me during nights when it hit me hard, leave me alone to deal with my emotions regarding it. He was cold. He never helped me through my panic attacks regarding the event, and said it was my responsibility to figure out myself. I was there for him though. I told him that I would put my needs on hold for the time being, to take care of him. I talked him through all his bad moments, taking verbal abuse during those times. The awful names I was called, the crazy outlandish accusations he told me with the sole purpose of hurting me. I took it all because I cared for him. Despite this, he wouldn’t do anything for me. I wanted to take him to a concert he had told me about, for a band I really liked. Since he wasn’t feeling well, there was a possibility of him not attending with me, which was fine. The day of the event, instead of simply telling me he wasn’t feeling up to it, he again resorted to verbal abuse. He made me feel awful about myself, and made comments regarding the child we had lost in attempts to hurt me. It broke my spirit. He took something I was really looking forward to, and ruined it, as he had done many times in the past. He has done the same with certain vacations I’ve gone on, with our anniversary, and with events such as this concert. I think deep down he enjoyed witnessing my misery. A few other really messed up events happened, again reiterating the narrative that I always came second fiddle, and then came the day he dumped me. He told me I wasn’t good enough for him to help, and to figure out all of my pain myself. This was done over the phone, a month after our abortion. I was devastated. I felt discarded so soon after such an awful event that he helped cause. I was very distraught and brought back into an even worse place. He didn’t care about me at all.

A month after the breakup, he came back into my life with the promise of helping me. He told me he would help in any way that he could. After I voiced my frustrations at what had happened, he left abruptly again, and broke his promises to me yet again. I couldn’t take the whiplash of him constantly coming and going out of my life as he pleased, and him playing with my feelings. Because of this, I gave Costanza a piece of my mind. He resorted to calling me completely terrible things. Called me every name in the book, and blamed me for my abortion. He told me that God was going to smite me for what I had done, called me an awful mother, and kept the narrative that I was an evil person for going through with the abortion. He knew this would hurt me because he knew how much I was mourning my loss. He called it names too, all in attempts to hurt me. He again threatened me with his life, pretending that he had already taken irreversible actions, all in attempts to manipulate me. It was sick. We went no contact for the next few weeks. I blocked him on everything. I was disgusted. My friends ended up being very upset on my behalf, and left a comment on one of his videos. Costanza saw this and thought it was me, and got back into contact with me through an account I forgot to block. 

I was extremely reluctant to talk to him at first, but his tone seemed different. He seemed genuine. For the first time, he wanted to talk to me about my feelings and seemed like he actually wanted to help me. We became intimate, and everything seemed to be going well. We ended up getting back together. He was going away soon, and we both knew this. Every time we saw each other in that week, he wanted to be intimate, and always initiated. The day he was about to leave, we saw each other, he again initiated relations, despite seeing how upset I was that he was leaving. I wanted to hug and embrace him but he wanted other things. After intimacy, he dumped me. Yet again. I feel so violated regarding this. It makes me want to vomit. Costanza used me for sex, using the guise of “healing my wounds”. It’s disgusting, and he should be very ashamed. Especially knowing that I’m a rape survivor. It’s vile using someone who survived that for sex, despicable really. 

It took me a long time to realize everything that I went through was abuse. Costanza constantly gaslit me and had convinced me that his behavior was normal. It took being honest about him to my therapist to finally be put into a domestic violence support group. I never thought during my relationship with him that it was that bad, but after explaining all the emotional and verbal abuse he put me through, my support group was appalled. They told me it was one of the worst cases of emotional and mental abuse that they had ever seen. Costanza convinced me that just because he never hit me, it didn’t count. It did, and my experience is valid. I wanted him to make it up to me for so long, I thought he could change, but him using me for sex pretending to care about my feelings was my last straw. Costanza is a dangerous person that only holds empathy towards himself. I pray for any future girl he drags into a relationship with him. I want this to be a fair warning to them. I want nothing to do with Costanza, I am doing some serious soul searching trying to find myself after all the abuse he put me through, as well as grieving my losses. I hope when he reads this he’ll finally realize the extent of everything he has done. He tried really hard to break me, and he did. I’m picking up the pieces and learning how to love myself again. I pray for him to one day realize the error of his ways and to learn and never repeat what he did. This is my story, in my own words, not to be misconstrued by anyone else. Costanza doesn’t deserve my protection anymore, he inflicted too much pain. He doesn’t deserve it."
560,YSK: There's a 'right' way to eat Pringles and we've been doing it all wrong,YouShouldKnow," Why YSK: Many people think that Pringles are seasoned on both sides. In fact, only the top side gets a sprinkling of seasoning in the factory. When Pringles are stacked in their can, some of the seasoning rubs off onto the next chip – which is why they've always been a little uneven.

Here’s the step-by-step guide to getting all the Pringles:

1. Fold a sheet of paper in three
2. Insert it all the way inside the container, in between the container and the chips
3. Slide the sheet of paper out for a intact sheet of chips.

565,"YSK: If you are a new homeowner in a snowy climate, it is ideal to have an assortment of different types of shovels if you can.",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK: Not all snow shovels are created equal. There are shovels built to lift, shovels built to push, and those made to do both** (like the Head &amp; Shoulders of shovels).

For lighter snowfall, you will appreciate having a wider (30"" or 36"") snow pusher that is lower profile and allows you to easily move light snow and cover more ground quickly.  These shovels are best in 3"" or less.

For the end of the driveway after the plow has come through, use a bucket style shovel to lift heavier and more compact snow that you need to lift &amp; carry to it's spot.  If there is big-time accumulation, you'll be happy to have a scooping shovel (similar to what you may see on a farm) that can more easily grab deep snow. 

There are plenty of other designs as well for ergonomics,  bad backs and dual-hand placement and even one I've seen with wheels, so do a little research to find whatever is right for you.  But my message is about having an assortment of 2-3 different shovels for different types of snow accumulation throughout the season.  Shoveling snow is wildly easier for me these days than my first year of homeownership when I just had one basic combination shovel I bought on the cheap."

The new player ranks himself 3/10. The amateur ranks himself 5/10. The expert ranks herself a 9/10.

The reality is the new player is 1/10. The amateur is a 4/10. The expert is a 10/10.

The new player ranked himself the worst, but still overestimated himself by 2 points. The skilled amateur did the same thing but only by 1 point because he is better at assessing himself. The expert under-estimated their ability by 1 point.

But the health risks are clear, and smoke from a wood fire damages your respiratory system and heart in a similar fashion to cigarette smoking. Light fires frequently enough and it can become much worse.

The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#Health_effects) summary perfectly describes how bad it is:

&gt;With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of [wood smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_smoke) contributed to [chronic bronchitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis#Chronic_bronchitis), chronic interstitial [lung disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_disease), [pulmonary arterial hypertension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_arterial_hypertension) and [corpulmonale](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corpulmonale&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) (Pulmonary heart disease), and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC \[Residential Wood Combustion\] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary [lung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung) function in young [asthmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthmatics); increased incidence of acute [bronchitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis) and severity/frequency of [wheezing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheezing) and [coughing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coughing); and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute [respiratory infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_infections).

Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-9)The Washington State Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and [respiratory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system) are unable to filter [particulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates) emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, [carcinogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen) can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system.

[EPA](https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/wood-smoke-and-your-health)

&gt;The smoke from wood burning is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles (also called particle pollution, particulate matter, or PM). In addition to particle pollution, wood smoke contains several toxic air pollutants including: benzene, formaldehyde, acrolein, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)

[Heart.org](https://heart.org/)

&gt;A [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685524/) in the journal *Particle and Fibre Toxicology* found exposure to wood smoke causes the arteries to become stiffer, which raises the risk of dangerous cardiac events.

If your partner will not see/check the itemized receipt, just get cash back when checking out and save that cash somewhere safe. Bank statements will show the total grocery store bill without showing any cash was withdrawn. 

If your partner does check the itemized receipt, many stores now have free apps to clip digital coupons- my local store (giant) will give cash back for any digital coupons that did not properly come off during check out. Any coupons not “clipped” at least 30 minutes before a check out have to be manually paid out. 

I got $15 cash back from customer service today that will not show up on any receipt or bank statement. Thankfully this is not something I need to worry about , but I thought it may help someone in a difficult situation."

This is to influence the audience in a particular way 

Without using complex statistics jargon, here goes.

Example (not real data):
You live in Houston state in USA and see a interview that 80% of Americans surveyed believe a increase in the price of burgers (anything else) is expected in the next 12 months.

For the survey to have any value, all states, and all areas within the state's having diverse people should be represented equally in the survey to make it representative of America.

A simple act of conducting survey or interviewing people in an American city where the price of burgers has been steadily increasing in the recent past will give the survey a majority *positive* response. And vice-versa.

598,"YSK: 99% of women who wear ankle bracelets are just wearing jewelry, not signaling that they are in an open relationship.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: 

It's  misguided to assume that a woman who is wearing an anklet is  advertising anything beyond the fact that she enjoys wearing the jewelry  as an accessory.

Apparently,  there is a fringe group of dodgy folk who believe that anytime they see a  woman wearing an anklet, she is signaling that she is in an open  relationship (aka, a ""hotwife""). This is a poor assumption, and  demeaning to any woman who is a target of this kind of warped  perception. She doesn't deserve the off base thoughts about her, the  unwanted looks, and certainly not having some oaf make overtures toward  her, simply because she is wearing a piece of jewelry.

Women  don't need to send secret messages through their jewelry to signal that  they are looking for sex. Even if there is a small percentage of women  who do intentionally wear anklets to signal something, most women do not  do this. Those who do, will probably be sending out all kinds of ***other***  signals to show a man that they are sexually interested in him; they  won't simply be wearing an anklet and going about their business."

**Why YSK**: Many people bought Tiles over the years because they wanted a good quality convenient bluetooth tracking device for their keys or valuables. With the introduction of Apple's Airtags and Galaxy SmartTags, Tile has been under a lot of pressure with their extremely limited network. Now that their parent company has switched to one whose philosophy is radically different, those who bought Tiles in the past should reconsider if they want to continue using those products and lose out on a large part of their privacy.

Also something Tile customers may want to know is that Mark Zuckerberg's sister sits on Life360's [board of directors](https://investors.life360.com/investor-relations/?page=board-of-directors).

It is worth noting that when asked about the parent company change, a Tile representative stated, ""Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that,"" but that remains to be seen."

617,YSK that most firefighters struggle with their weight/health.,YouShouldKnow,"Year round, but especially during the holidays, the public accosts their nearby fire station with food. More often than not it is sweets and candy. Many firefighters are obese due to poor diet and lifestyle choices, their job doesn’t make it very easy either. And with obesity, increased tobacco use (again, personal choice), sleep deprivation, and the volatile chemicals they’re exposed to throughout their careers, many firefighters aren’t in perfect health. 

Why YSK this is because many firefighters are struggling with sleep apnea, poor heart health, and obesity. Also, many firefighters are uncomfortable with the gratitude. They certainly appreciate the public support but many view themselves as regular people and regular would and do do the things they do. Paying your taxes which pay us and buy us equipment is the greatest thing you can do for them. 

YSK that many firefighters often meal prep and/or cook family style dinners at the station. Any and all sweets and baked goods you bring will end up in a pile and either get thrown away or eaten. This causes a lot of fights at the station. They really don’t need or want anything from the public and the gesture is largely forgotten almost as soon as you leave the property because you are not the only person who had that idea. 

YSK that if you absolutely must bring something to the local fire station, it doesn’t have to be grilled seared chicken breast with asparagus cooked in avocado oil. Just let it be substantial and not junk food. It’s hard enough living a healthy lifestyle without the public pressuring you to eat their cookies and muffins, they don’t need the extra temptation.

642,YSK: It isn't normal for your cats to be vomiting frequently,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

I often see people causally mentioning the inconvenience of their cat vomiting on their floor, as if it is a normal part of cat behaviour.

It isn't.

Cats will throw up occasionally - typically because of a fur ball or having eaten too quickly, but it isn't normal for them to be doing it as frequently as ""once every few weeks"".

Cats can often vomit because:

- You aren't grooming your cat enough, therefore fur balls are forming and will eventually be expelled (a complete brush once a week should be sufficient in minimising this)


- It is eating too quickly, playing too soon after eating, or both


- You are changing their food too frequently - you should find a food that works (ask your vet) and stick with it



If none of these reasons sound like they could be the cause of your cat vomiting, then you should take it to the vet and get it checked out - it could be a sign of an underlying illness, intolerance to a specific food, or exposure to something toxic (some houseplants can be culprits).

Also, for goodness sake, don't give your cat chocolate or anything that isn't strictly edible for cats (Google if in doubt)."

My sister and her husband could've died.

I overheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and can't figure out why - this is red flag #1, but it didn't click in my brain at that point.

Several hours later, my sister was having a discussion with our dad.  For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:

Dad (joking): ""It sounds like your house is haunted!""

Sister: ""It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time.""

*click*

Me: ""Do you have a CO detector in your house?""

Sister: ""No.  Why?""

Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.

Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:

 Dull headache
 Weakness
 Dizziness
 Nausea

These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.

Additional symptoms can be found [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642) and [here](https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/)

This is called a conflict of interest. People in that situation can take advantage of others, often unintentionally. If you ever find someone in that situation giving you advice, please get a second opinion. 

* If your boss says you can't be paid overtime, or that OSHA regulation doesn't apply, look up the actual law or ask /r/legaladvice 

* A company that dislikes unions should not be your only source of information about whether unions are good for workers 

* If you believe someone did something illegal, but they say it's totally fine, report it anyway

* Never take legal advice from someone who is threatening to sue you

It seems to me based on films I have seen, many of them are unknowingly promoting rape culture. In one very popular film I rewatched recently (Superbad), Jonah hill jokes that parties are for getting girls really drunk so they’ll sleep with you.

With recent personal events this shocked me that such a popular film would joke about something like that and normalise it. If you sleep with someone (whether it’s a man/woman) who is blackout drunk and likely would never even consider sleeping with you sober THAT IS RAPE, there was no consent.

If you’re still reading also please read up on symptoms of Rohypnol/ GHB (date rape drugs). Many people think being spiked looks like you’re really drunk, unable to speak or walk but the reality is often VERY different. They can make you euphoric, lose inhibition, increase sense of connection with others, influence decision making and increase libido. If the spiker knows what they’re doing it can be so hard to spot and it’s so important to look out for your friends and ANY indication they may have been spiked GET TESTED ASAP. These drugs only stay in your system for a few hours and we need to start catching these bastards!

Then they print the check and eventually mail it. It could take 2-3 weeks for it to actually be received by the person/ company you're paying. 

Source: I work for a company that performs Home maintenance services, and it's not uncommon to receive packets of bill payment checks. It appears that when banks have multiple clients sending payments to the same company, they will hold the checks and send them all in the same envelope. I regularly receive packets of bill payment checks, with the checks themselves having dates ranging over a space of two weeks. The number of clients who get angry with me for telling him I haven't received their payment yet, when the bank has given them a date and already withdrawn their funds makes me realize that people don't understand how bill payment seems to work. The funds don't come out of your account when the checks are received, they come out of your account when the checks are printed, which is not necessarily even when they are mailed out.

Note that this may not apply to all bank bill pay systems and you should contact your individual bank for more details."

If you didn't know, flouride helps build up enamel on the outer surface of your teeth, helping prevent cavities, and is why it's so important to brush every night and only spit.

Brushing in the morning is obviously recommended, but you'll usually eat and drink during the day, removing a lot of the flouride.

674,"YSK that if you buy a house or refinance your mortgage, you may get a ton of spam mail about your deed and mortgage paperwork, and you should ignore ALL of it.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

-depending on your state's public real estate records, predatory companies may be able to see whenever your new deed or mortgage is filed into public record when you purchase a property or refinance a mortgage.

-these predatory companies will spam mail you with offers to send copies of your documents for an exorbitant price which you can otherwise get for free or very inexpensively

-(by the way, other predatory companies will spam mail you with life insurance offers to pay off your new mortgage (even if you refinance) if you die. I just refinanced and got no less than 12 mailers across 2 weeks.) 

-you should never pay any 3rd party company for copies of your deed and mortgage if you buy or refinance a house. Your title company should send copies to you free of charge or for a few dollars. You can also obtain them from the local public record authority for a small charge compared to the insane fees charges by the predatory mail companies. 

This is so insidious because most people don't know how real estate records work. 

There's nothing illegal about what these companies do, but it's very unethical. It costs them 50 cents to mail you a letter, makes you think you need to get the service from them, and if you give them hundreds of dollars for their ""service"" then they just made 99.9% profit. 

If you need any paperwork after your closing, contact your title company, bank, insurance company, or whatever service provider you've already engaged. Don't fall victim to the public record profiteers."

709,YSK: These Tips and Tricks when flying to your next destination,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: With travels picking up again, these tips and tricks would hopefully make your flight more safe and enjoyable!

- Before turning the overhead air vents on, make sure they are in the closed position (turn counter-clockwise until no ring is visible) and use alcohol wipes to disinfect before using. Consider wiping down your tray tables as well if you will be eating.

- If you're a member of the Frequent Flyer program with any airline, just be aware that when your number is scanned there is a section for notes about you that crews of your previous flights can input. If you have been not so cordial with flight crews in the past, notes about you may be read by your future flight crews.

- If you are visiting a destination for the first time, ask your flight attendant for their recommended places to go because they usually have a stopover for a day if your destination is a part of their regular routes.

- If you are traveling internationally bring a pen to fill out the international forms.

- Drink water before and after your flight because flying causes dehydration. Bring eye drops and chap stick to moisturize as needed.There is less oxygen getting to your body because the plane pressurizes the air which is being circulated in the cabin. Water intake also helps with jet lag.

- Don't order coffee, tea, or hot water during your flight. It is the same potable water that is used for the system that links to the bathroom.

- If you have an extra carry-on and want to risk avoiding charges, bring it to the gate after going through security instead of paying for it to be checked beforehand. If your destination is a popular one, usually 20 minutes before the flight boards there will be an announcement that you will be on a full flight and any passengers wishing to check their carry-ons will be able to do so free of charge.

- Not many people know this, but the flight crew is only paid when the plane's doors are locked and the brakes are up. This means when they are greeting passengers during the plane boarding, ""assisting"" passengers with their luggage (flight attendants are not allowed to lift your luggage), performing the pre-flight safety demo, etc they are not being paid to do so. If flights are delayed and canceled, flight crews do not get paid for the time they are there. Flight attendants do not accept cash for tips. If you had a pleasant experience with your flight attendant, write to the airline and mention your flight, the date of the flight, and flight attendant's name for your kudos.

710,YSK that drinking bottled water results in consuming 22x more microplastics than tap water,YouShouldKnow,"Ditch one-use plastic bottles, use glass or metal reusable bottles.

Why YSK: 
Recent studies show how microplastics can pass through the brain-blood barrier, we inhale it, drink it, eat it. The rich, poor, the young, the old, the secluded all have it circulating in their bodies.

It's everywhere; from the highest mountain peaks to the deepest ocean trenches. We are what we eat, but we can reduce microplastic consumption by ditching plastic containers and one-use items (grocery produce bags, plastic utensils, plastic bottles vs reusable cloth produce bags, metal utensils, glass bottles, etc)

714,YSK: Google Password Manager is not comparable to third party managers,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: I figured I'd save someone else the headache I'm currently going though. You should know google password manager is a browser-based manager and linked to your browser's data like history/cookies/cache, so it can be cleared accidentally and easily. A third party app (lastpass, keeper, 1password, etc.) is a true password manager and much better choice. Other things to note if you're new to tech-security and want to be better: Google's auto-generating feature only creates relatively simple passwords and you cannot change the requirements/length. It is **only** available with chrome, while third party managers are separate entities and have apps/extensions. Being linked to google, someone would only need one password on one of your devices to access them *all*.

How did I learn this? Well, I absent-mindedly cleared my history along with all other data in the advanced settings to help try and debug an app. Next thing I know, the entirety of 2+ years of saved passwords, most of which are auto-generated, are gone! Don't be like me. But if you do want to stick with google pw manager, make sure to back them up. There is an option to download a .csv file with all your passwords if you want to move them to another manager. That introduces a whole other layer of risk, so be careful."

The program ended as of Q4 2021 but you can still file for 2020 and the first 3 quarters of 2021. 

Eligibility and how to file it is a little complicated so prepare to do research but essentially you are just comparing your gross receipts in 2020 and 2021 to what you made in 2019. For 2020 your gross receipts have to be 50% or less, for 2021 they were a lot more generous with it having to be just 20% or less. 

I only filed for the first 3 quarters of 2021 and got $600k, which ended up being much more than I would have made in 2021, so kudos to the whoever approved this one.

Conspiracy me says the program was designed so that only the ""elite"" are able to take advantage of it since it was not very well known compared to PPP and most people will need an accountant just to understand how it works and getting it filed. I can guarantee that every huge business that took a 20% hit in 2021 (or 50% in 2020) took advantage of this, while most small businesses don't even know about it. 

This program for 2021 paid up to $7000 per employee per quarter(they take 70% of payroll up to $10k), how they came up with that number beats me but hey I'm not complaining."

722,"YSK - clean your dryer exhaust yearly, both inside and out.",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK** lint buildup happens in the exhaust *no matter how religiously you clean it in the dryer* and can create a fire hazard if not cleaned. The excess lint accumulates in the exhaust (the tube in the wall that goes outside) and due to moisture, will build up fairly quickly, so if you clean it once a year, it keeps the buildup to a minimum. 

-Especially if you rent, you never know when the last time was the line was cleaned so it should be one of the first things done before connecting your dryer.-

In states that go below freezing, and in homes where the exhaust line is low, remember to check to ensure the ice buildup is not getting close to the line. The ice accumulates from the ground up, so if it gets too close, knock it over. Most building codes require new construction to be well off the ground but older homes can have lines close enough that ice buildup can accumulate enough that it reaches the line and you can quickly asphyxiate once the dryer is engaged. 

We use the new year as our reminder to change smoke detector batteries, clean furnace and dryer exhausts, etc., and thought it might also help someone else. If you’re uncomfortable performing this task, it is recommended to clean your furnace exhaust bi-yearly and if you ask, an HVAC company will gladly clean your dryer vent, as well."

758,YSK that deleting your data doesn't always delete it,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: your data can often still be recovered, and hacked, even after your request that it be deleted was confirmed by a company.

I worked as a data scientist in big tech, and observed that data deletion is tricky business. Data governance laws vary by country and even state, and range quite widely. In some jurisdictions, there are no requirements: a company owns the data generated through your interactions with its services. Other countries/states do have data ownership/privacy requirements, but even the most stringent laws often require that data not be actually deleted.

Many large companies retain data for ""compliance"" reasons. A request to delete personal data, while often honored for marketing purposes by companies seeking to operate legally (not all do), is often considered legally compliant if a company only locks your data away rather than deletes it. Data access in these cases is usually limited to a handful of people dedicated to the data privacy compliance effort, but the data is often kept for months and even years. This is not a company's fault, but rather is mandated by other laws--ones that help identify corruption, market manipulation, anti-consumer actions, etc.

While retaining data is useful for the above reasons, this legal mess can create confusion for ordinary people. In practice, your data is often accessible even after a company ""deletes"" it. Given that data breaches in today's world are effectively only a matter of time at any given company, you can pretty much assume that any online interaction you make can one day surface. Companies do have an obligation to try to keep this from happening, but can seldom be counted on as software often relies on hundreds and thousands of other pieces of software as dependencies--consistently updating all of which is incredibly difficult."

So in the United States, anything that is “aluminum-free” is a deodorant and will only cover up the scent, but does nothing for sweat prevention, which causes the bad smell in the first place. Any company that tells you their aluminum-free deodorant is an antiperspirant is making either a mislabeled claim, or might be adulterated depending on the situation the FDA deems fit.

Antiperspirants usually contain aluminum as an ingredient, deodorants, for the most part, do not. I’m seeing people buy the more expensive brand of deodorant, because the label says it’s aluminum free. Aluminum was never an ingredient in deodorant to begin with, don’t pay extra for “Aluminum free” deodorant. If anything, pay extra for the Aluminum free antiperspirants.

774,"YSK that Unlimited PTO/Vacation is not a perk, even though it is often used as a selling point by companies during the recruiting process.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: in a traditional PTO package with a set number of days per year, your vacation time is accrued each payroll period essentially creating a bank of days off. Some companies will even let you carry over a certain amount of days into the following year (although that is becoming increasingly rare these days). If you are allowed 3 weeks per year and you are allowed to carry over 1 week per year, over the course of 5 years, you could build up a pretty substantial amount of accrued PTO. If you leave the company, they have to make you whole… in other words, that company is required to pay back all your accrued vacation time at the end of your employment. 

However, with an unlimited vacation policy, no vacation time is accrued at any point throughout the year. So if you had a really stressful year which didn’t allow you to take PTO and the company lays you off in December, you receive nothing. In the 3 week PTO example, the company would have to comp you always 3 weeks of accrued vacation time.

Also, there is a psychological component in play as well. If employees are given unlimited PTO, most take less time off throughout any given year. If a company says you HAVE to take 3 weeks this year (no carryover), you’re going to plan out that time off. If unlimited, you always think that you’ll get around to planning time off but then that always gets delayed. As one who can speak from experience in my current company, I make sure to assign myself X number of days off per year and track to that. Believe me, it helps.

Just remember, a lot of companies are not “cool” or progressive with these perks that make them seem more attractive, they are usually tactics that somehow benefit their bottom lines in the end."

Those ads you see all the time for “free delivery” really mean “no delivery fee.” There’s also 15-20% service fees, they inflate menu prices, and add surge fees and minimum cart fees. Sales taxes are also calculated differently from app to app! One item that’s $10 on the menu could very well be $17 on a delivery app. I usually avoid these fees by either 1. Picking up the food myself or 2. Using a food delivery aggregator like FoodBoss or MealMe.

I saw a video showing household tips &amp; tricks and they used petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to lubricate the doors and now (2 years later) they still slide along effortlessly. 

You have to be tall enough to reach the top of the door. There are usually a two brackets up on top with a small wheel that rides along a rail. If you can't see it you can move your door back &amp; forth slowly and feel around with your finger until you come across a little wheel spinning. Take some petroleum jelly on the end of your finger and touch it to the wheel as you move the door slowly. 

The wheel will spread the jelly on the rail and use it up, which is what you want to happen. You should  have to use about 3 dabs to cover the rail &amp; wheel really well. Move the door as far as you can one way then the other. Repeat with the other bracket. Then repeat on the two brackets on the other door. 

When you are done with the jelly just use the door handle to move the doors back &amp; forth as far as you can about a dozen times. This makes sure the lubricant is spread the entire length of the rails. You should already notice how easily it is gliding along. If not, then you have other problems. 

Why YSK: A sliding door has moving pieces just like hinges move on swinging doors and need lubrication. Most people don't think about lubricating the moving pieces because they are hidden. You won't believe how easily some will open &amp; shut afterwards."

803,YSK: The Horrors of the Fast Food Industry,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: You can save yourself a lot of misery by avoiding fast food jobs, and the stories I will tell you about what happened to some of the food will make you not want to eat there anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who has worked numerous fast food jobs, I can tell you these are some of the absolute worst working conditions in America. I have worked at Popeye's, Jack in the Box, and Burger King. Do you like being tremendously under-compensated for your work? Then fast food is for you. Popeye's paid $10/hr, Burger King paid $9.50, Jack in the Box paid $9. Now imagine you work an 8 hour shift at Jack in the Box and come away with $70 for your efforts. They're making $70 in sales *within 100 seconds.* Seriously, it takes them 2-3 sales to earn what you get paid over an entire 8 hour shift. The pay is insulting and impossible to live off of.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and that's not all. While the tasks may be ""easy"", they are CONSTANT. Imagine making dozens and dozens and dozens of sandwiches in  a row, and the line never slows down or ceases. **I have made food poorly out of spite, and so have my coworkers. You should know that if you join an already long line, thus putting more stress on grossly underpaid workers, they may make your food poorly out of frustration.** And that's not all. Most fast food places don't offer a break. You're expected to work 8 hours straight, only getting to rest when the line stops.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all either. The conditions are poor. You're surrounded by multiple fryers, causing the air in the restaurant to get hot and humid, causing you to sweat. Not only that, but the air is filled with grease and you will feel gross by the end of your shift. Not to mention that eating the unhealthy food on a daily basis can lead to weight gain and health problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Not here's another kicker. Because you are working in a low-paying industry that will basically hire anyone, you are going to meet some bad people.** I worked with a man who would literally clock in, go to the manager's office (This was the overnight so there was no manager there), and just go to sleep. Then he'd wake up, call his girlfriend, and start screaming at her. This was a nightly occurrence. Another guy I worked with frequently went to the bathroom to do meth and crack. He was homeless, spent his checks on drugs, and would get so high he would spend the entire shift talking to himself. He called women ""Skynet"" and said he needed to take them out, and asked me where to get a gun. Another woman and her boyfriend quit after his repeated abuse. There are plenty of bad people in fast food.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, ok, I get it, you don't care about the working conditions. All you want is a decent meal. Let me tell you about the things I've seen.** I've seen sandwich buns dropped on the floor, and instead of throwing them away, the employee will continue to make the sandwich with those buns. I've seen entire buckets of raw chicken dropped onto the ground, only to be thrown in the fryer instead of the garbage. I've seen swarms and swarms of flies in the kitchen, both at Popeye's and Burger King. Most of the time, employees didn't wear gloves, they made the food with their bare hands. Those are just a few examples, and I'm sure I could think of more if I tried."

812,YSK that most people misunderstand what “% chance of rain” actually means; 50% chance of rain doesn’t mean that there’s a 50% chance that it will rain that day.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: because its a common misperception that is can affect how we organize our day. 

In simplistic terms: 50% chance of rain means that it is expected that 50% of a certain area is expected to see rain.

The formula to calculate Precipitation Chance (%) = Confidence of Precipitation Developing x Percent of Area Affected.

If the confidence level is 100% then a 30% chance of rain means that 30% of the coverage area will see precipitation. If the confidence level is 50% and only 40% of the coverage area will see precipitation, then the math is (0.50 x 0.40) x 100 = 20 or 20% chance of rain.

They even have high CBD strains which are usually recommended for medical weed.

Do you know the signs?
1. The leader is the ultimate authority
If you’re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you’re probably in a cult.
2. The group suppresses skepticism
If you’re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you’re probably in a cult. Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult
4. The group is paranoid about the outside world
5. The group relies on shame cycles
6. The leader is above the law 
7. The group uses “thought reform” methods
If your serious questions are answered with cliches, you’re probably in a cult.
8. The group is elitist
If your group is the solution for all the world’s problems, you’re probably in a cult.

821,YSK pet cats outdoors and feral cats are a huge predation issue.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Letting your cats outside may be great for their mental health, but it is worse for your local ecosystem. Cats are natural predators, and as a result are the largest and most abundant invasive predator of birds in the US. 

Feral cats number over 50M in the US, equating to about **8 billion** small game hunts, most of which are small song birds.(2.4 billion) 

Why is this important to me?

**a single mating pair of cats can produce 400,000 offspring in 7 years**

**a UNebraska study has pinned 33 bird extinction events on cat predation**

**Humans**, almost 8 billion of us and our cars, **are responsible for about 400M deaths of song-birds annually, cats are 2.4 billion**

Third-party SMS apps can read all your messages, including secure login code sent to you by banks or other finance websites.



Here’s how this attack could work:

Step 1: get email address either as part of sign up process for the app or overtime as part of app usage when the user sends their email address 

Step 2: look through password dumps for leaked passwords 

Step 3: attempt to sign into websites and if a website sends a two-factor code, steal the code from the app

—

Even if you are diligent about changing all your passwords after a leak, the messaging app could still leak other information (such as websites you use) which could make you susceptible to attacks. As an example, say you placed an order for something from a site that sends you an sms notification to confirm your order. The attacker could then use this information to send you a very specific email (e.g. your order is delayed) from this site. By using a familiar site or a recent order, it might cause you to lower your guard just enough to login to a hacked site.


**Will everyone fall for these?**
Of course not! However, by installing a third-party messaging app, you are just increasing your attack surface."

839,"YSK that yelling, screaming, name-calling, etc, is not normal and rarely exists in healthy relationships.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: If you're like me, yelling was the only form of communication in your household. What many may not realize is the impact of that kind of behavior has long term effects on one's self esteem, view of relationships, mental health (negative core self beliefs, trauma, PTSD/CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc etc) and needs as a person. Thats why its important to stop the cycle and learn to communicate properly. Healing is definitely possible.

It doesn't matter how well they treat you after or how sincerely they apologize. It doesn't matter if they are your parents or guardians. This is not normal healthy behavior. Healthy relationships involve talking about problems and working things out. There is no hurtful name-calling or blaming things on the other person. If they are willing to call you names to get a rise out of you on purpose, how do you think that will work out with children or years down the line?

Its hard enough to find a relationship, I get it, but yelling and screaming happen when there is not enough healthy communication. 9/10 times situations that involve yelling or screaming could be solved by a calm, emotionally mature, and honest conversation.

If you know you do this, own it. Talk to a therapist about why and work on it. You will be so much happier and healthier when you can communicate your feelings through talking rather than the less effective and more hurtful mode of verbal violence"

851,"YSK that if your wait at a restaurant is longer than you'd like, the hostess is literally the last person in the building who deserves to be yelled at.",YouShouldKnow," 

Why YSK: The primary goal of the hostess at a restaurant is to seat your party as quickly as possible. It is in her own best interest to move you right on through to the dining room, so please be assured that if there was anything she can do to lower your wait time, she would do it. She does not deserved to be yelled at because your wait is 15 minutes longer than you expected. 

Pretty much every restaurant is woefully understaffed right now. Those that survived the last couple of years are trying to operate as lean as possible. Until the restaurant industry has time to recover, this is likely to remain the case. Even then, I imagine they will have a tough time attracting enough workers to become fully staffed unless they make dramatic improvements to how their employees are compensated. The hostess that you are taking your frustrations out on is one of, if not the lowest paid, employees in the restaurant, and in many cases it is their very first job. With the staffing situation the way it is now, she is very likely having to bus tables, answer the phone, pack to-go orders, and do cleanliness checks on the restrooms, as well as manage the waitlist and coordinate the seating of diners. On top of that, she is going to be the first one to get grief from her managers when customers start to pile up waiting to be seated.

The hostess at a restaurant cannot seat you if there isn’t a table available for you. It’s as simple as that. Just because you see an empty table, or a dozen empty tables, doesn’t mean that there are enough servers on duty to work those tables. The hostess cannot put you at a table that doesn’t have a server assigned to it.

If you MUST yell at someone, first of all, get some psychiatric help at the first opportunity, but until then maybe yell at other diners who loiter for an hour after their meal is finished. Or yell at the manager, who at least to some degree has some control over how the restaurant is staffed at any given time. Maybe write a scathing email or make an irate phone call to the corporate office, if it’s a chain, or the owner if it’s privately owned, and insist that they raise wages or do whatever they need to do to attract more staff.

Please, if you are not capable of being patient and showing a little bit of grace, please just eat at home. You never know the battles someone else is fighting in their life, and your harsh words at that particular time may have an impact that on them that you never intended."

855,"YSK: If you’re turning 21, make sure to request your pediatric medical records from every hospital/doctor office you’ve visited!",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Apparently once you turn 21, many (but not all) hospital systems and medical offices destroy your pediatric medical records. (I’ve linked to Texas guidelines on this, but this is similar for many states—mine was New York). Be sure to request them beforehand so you can keep them on file and to update your PCP!

I am turning 21 soon and recently requested my medical records from when I was born. My parents forgot a lot of the medical problems I had when I was born, and they might be implicated in some of the health problems I’m having now. Plus, it’s good to have the records in order to double-check that you have the right information about your childhood health and that nothing was hidden from you.

Along with a lot of important medical information, I also saw lots of neat things, such as my ink footprints and my Apgar score.[Texas Guidelines](https://www.texmed.org/template.aspx?id=1556)"

The reason you should know is that it’s this blind belief that advertisers and scammers exploit daily. We are living in an age where companies have learnt how easy it is to manipulate us. By taking everything you see at face value you are opening yourself up to this manipulation. And basically opening up your wallet, and in some cases your values and belief systems.

It’s quick and easy to do a quick internet search about anything to find out if something is likely to be true.

930,"YSK that Naloxone (Narcan) can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. It is safe to use, and requires no specialized training.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Opioid overdoses kit [100,000 Americans per year]. If given early enough, Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and restore normal breathing. It works by turning off opioid receptors in the brain, meaning it has no effects on someone who isn't being affected by opioids.

In my home state of Minnesota, most pharmacies give it out for free. No special training is required.

Note that it is a controlled substance, so you will need a prescription in some states. More info below. 

&gt;How Does Naloxone Work?

&gt;Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist meaning it binds to opioid receptors and reverses or blocks the effects of other opioids. Giving naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal respiration. It can be administered by injection or through a nasal spray.

&gt;Is Naloxone Safe?

&gt;Yes. There is no evidence of significant adverse reactions to naloxone. Administering naloxone in cases of opioid overdose can cause withdrawal symptoms when the person is dependent on opioids; this is uncomfortable without being life threatening. The risk that someone overdosing on opioids will have a serious adverse reaction to naloxone is far less than their risk of dying from overdose. Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is suspected.

942,YSK: never say “at least” when someone is telling you their problems,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Saying “at least” implies to the other person that their problem isn’t that bad. In actuality, their problem is bad to them and that’s what matters. 

It also dismisses them and does not let them finish speaking about it. “At least” shuts them down. They should not have to defend why their problem is a problem to you.

Finally, just because they do not have it the worst or it could be worse, does not mean that they are not experiencing the pain from their own problem. 

The example I’ve seen countless times is simple. If someone is telling you about a miscarriage and the emotional/physical pain they are experiencing and you reply, “at least you can have (or already have) children,” you are completely shutting them out."
943,YSK: Harder work doesn’t always mean a better result.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: There’s an attitude in this world that working hard automatically means you’ll have a better outcome. It’s not true.

Just because you spent an hour and half on liver and onions doesn’t mean you made something tastier than a regular grilled cheese. Just because you wrote a song mixing time signatures and changing keys doesn’t mean it sounds better than some rudimentary Green Day tune. Just because you spent 8 years on a degree, doesn’t mean you developed a skill worth more than  $12/hr. 

Some valuable things in this world take hard work, but not everything that takes hard work is valuable. Before you work hard on something, ask if it’s the best use of your effort."

957,YSK that being hypersexual is common for rape victims,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Often times the media surrounds the narrative of a rape victim as someone who outright repels sex/sexuality as a result of their traumatic experience, and while that happens, the opposite end of the spectrum is sometimes looked down upon and outright ignored even though it’s highly common amongst rape victims.  

Like any traumatic experience, rape has long and lasting impacts to the victim. And due to the unfortunate controversial nature of rape/ rape-culture in itself, stuff like the psychological repercussions of it are often not spoken about enough and swept under the rug.

“Rape trauma syndrome” (RTS) is the name attributed to the disruptions to normal, physical, emotional, and interpersonal behavior as a result of an assault. There are different stages assigned to the time after the assault. Symptoms can range from a complete minimization of the abuse (blaming oneself, watering it down), to dramatization (cannot stop speaking about it). Needless to say the emotional/physical effects of a rape range greatly. 

Sexual relationships of a rape survivor often become disturbed and they too, range greatly. Some victims shield from contact and develop a fear of intimacy, while others become hyper sexual or “promiscuous” as a subconscious means to reassert a measure of control over their sexual relationships. While this is a documented and common experience, it’s often overshadowed by the depiction of a sex-repulsed survivor. Sometimes due to the shame of it and purity culture in general."

963,"YSK: Winter is here, top up your tires!",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Cold temperatures condense the air in your tires, so even those perfectly OK looking winter or all weather tires on your car or truck can actually be dangerously low.

This increases wear, affects ride, and changes how the tire contacts slippery surfaces, making it potentially much more dangerous on slippery roads for both you, and the other drivers around you if you lose control.

Imagine the water as 1 ton cubes moving at that speed, and you will see how cars get swept away trying to cross.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

Many people vastly underestimate the forces even small bodies of water can impart.

There's a silly little rule of thumb that's actually pretty helpful. If you dropped a flower in the water, would you have time to bend down and pick it up, or is flowing away out of reach by the time you did?

If you can pick it up, you're fine.

If not, basically, if the water goes over your ankles you can be taken off your feet at any moment, mind the rocks, but are okayish.

If it goes over your knees, you're at serious risk of being taken by the stream.

If you're trying to move something with a large surface area, like the wheels of a car, or god help you its deep enough to be pushing on the whole sides of the car, you're fucked.

Moving bodies of water contain incredible energies, water is really, really dense. I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.

I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.

Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.

Your car absolutely will not win."

970,"YSK: Truffle oil does not contain any truffles, but rather uses a chemical to poorly imitate the aroma.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Once upon a time, truffle oil was just oil infused with truffles. [These days, it is oil infused with 2,4-dithiapentane,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle_oil ) a hydrocarbon with a flavor that can best be described as a parody of truffle.

I actually kind of liked truffle oil, until I ate the real deal, which is so much more subtle, deep and pleasant in flavor. It’s also far more expensive, sure—Italian white truffles can be over $200 per oz. But cheaper varieties, like Burgundy black truffles, are about a tenth of that: an expense well worth it in my opinion.

What irks me most is that restaurants will have dishes on their menu described as having truffles—truffle risotto, truffle fries, etc, but are really using truffle oil instead of the real thing. Not only do they use this as an excuse to upcharge the dish by ten dollars because of the “luxury” status, they also overwhelm the food with a pungent chemical inferior to the advertised product.

But don’t take my word for it:
""One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef,"" Gordon Ramsay once told a competitor on MasterChef.

Reaching for the oil is ""a sure sign of someone who doesn't know what they're doing,"" Joe Bastianich said in the same episode.

""Fake truffle flavoring is one of those things that's especially upsetting, because not only does it taste like a bad chemical version of the real thing, it's the flavor that almost everyone now associates with truffles,"" Jonathan Gold says.

So, if you enjoy truffle oil, power to you. But be aware that it is not truffles that you are tasting and paying big money for. And if you ever get a chance, try some real truffles: they rule."

973,YSK When you've smoked weed other people can absolutely smell it on you.,YouShouldKnow,"You know for example when you've smoked a bit of weed and then go out and you are in public transport, or a classroom, or a shop, and you start getting paranoid. Can people smell it on me? Can they tell I've been smoking?

The answer is absolutely yes. Generally speaking your clothes and hair absolutely reek of the smell. It's very strong and noticeable. 

Why YSK? Because when you're smoking you often fight getting paranoid. And you should. But also it helps to know that in this one matter you are not being paranoid. People can smell it on you. So if you are in a context where you don't want your smoking to be public or known then you should act with this knowledge. 

It's another matter though if the average person would recognise the smell, or pinpoint specifically where it's coming from. But anyone who has smoked will be able to spot it. And in most cases even when people can smell it most don't care in the slightest."

981,"YSK: if you want a telemarketer to stop calling you, don’t curse them out, hang up without saying anything, or even ask them to take you off their list. Simply get a caller ID with Video so that you can see who’s calling or hear what every call is about before you answer.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: I’ve worked in a telemarketing firm. I know for a fact that cursing out a telemarketing employee is the best way to ensure that you get calls day in, day out. Most firms use automatic dialing programs, where you need to “disposition” the call after you hang up. So you select a preset from a menu of options to explain how the call went (ex. There’s an option for no answer, not interested, not qualified, and other things of that nature).

There is also a Callback Later disposition, in which the phone number would be put back into the automatic dialer’s call queue at another point in the day. I’ve seen time after time, when a co-worker got cussed out over the phone they would always disposition the call as callback later. We were trained to never disposition a phone number as Do Not Call unless the “customer” threatens to report us to the BBB or uses a video caller ID. 

However there are also call dispositions for wrong numbers, which we would have to put for anyone who picks up the phone and says it’s a business line, or that they’re the new owner of the phone number and not the original person whom we had info for on a previous lead. Once a phone number was dispositioned as a wrong number, it was also taken out of the system. Also, no small business wants to get complaints written about them on the BBB, it’s hard enough for them to have a positive reputation as it is if they’re having a sales floor making 130k glorified cold calls on the daily.

TL:DR: telemarketing employees are just going to make sure you get called back by their company if you give them a hard time over the phone. Just mention the Federal No Call List or the Better Business Bureau or use a video caller ID such as [mobiline.com](https://mobiline.com)"
982,YSK: Paying in cash/debit effectively subsidizes other customers who are paying with credit,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Credit card networks charge a 1-3% processing fee for their services, so retailers and restaurants often mark up their prices for everyone to compensate. Credit card holders will get 1-3% back in cashback or points, so even if a retailer raises prices, they effectively get the fair-market value price for the good. 

Cash payers, otoh, don't - so they end up paying 1-3% above the normal asking price to compensate for credit card users."

A little mess is fine, but don’t be that person that all the employees will bitch about when you leave. Making all that mess is unnecessary and you’re making their life much harder when it is __SO__ easy to not.

1007,YSK: It's really easy to unknowingly trap a customer-service worker in a conversation they don't want to have,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Someone who works in customer service will almost inevitably have casual conversations with some of the customers, especially if they see the same customers regularly.

When that happens, the worker has almost no way of politely declining the conversation if they don't feel like talking. For one, it could be considered rude, and the worker probably has to take special care to not hurt customers' feelings.

Second, the worker can't just say ""Hey, I've got to go"" and walk away. They have to stay, sometimes at the exact spot where you're having the conversation.

The only thing that they can really do is maybe say ""Hey, I've got a lot of work to do, can we talk later?"", but some people wouldn't want to lie if they *don't* actually have work to do, and it can be awkward even if it's true.

I work at a hotel and this happens all the time. It's basically in my job description to be engaged with guests at all times, during conversations both casual and otherwise, which makes them think that I like these talks way more than I actually do.

Even when I try to give hints that I'm not into it by not saying much, shifting my eye contact to my desk, or typing on my computer, they rarely get the hint. It's a terrible feeling to be all but forced to have a conversation when you really would rather not.

Please don't keep people in long conversations unless you're *sure* they're into it, especially if the other party is at their job."

1024,YSK leaving water bottles/snacks for any delivery or mail service this time of year can mean a lot to someone,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK, this time of year and even more so this year (at least in the United States as far as I know), the mail and package services are completely overwhelmed. This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can't exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked ""help yourself delivery people"" can make a huge difference in their day. 

My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn't even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.

TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it's not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don't, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today's world we need more of that!"

1026,YSK: the difference between Purified and Spring water.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: they offer two different things. Purified water is also a bit cheaper since it has less ingredients, which means most people casually buy it from the grocery store over Spring water.. but Spring water tastes better and has essential minerals that Purified water is missing. 

Purified water has been completely stripped of all substances and contaminants. There are no bacteria to make you sick, no sediment particles to feel in your mouth, or chemicals to slowly poison you.. but there are also no minerals. You should be getting plenty of minerals in your diet already, but removing a source of minerals has the potential to cause deficiencies. Some water purification systems such as reverse osmosis fix this problem by reintroducing the essential minerals. Water purified through such methods is the healthiest choice for drinking.

Spring water still contains all of the essential minerals that are important for your health and also give water its taste. Other contaminants can also be present though, such as metals, nitrates, chlorine, and other chemicals. Some of these may have been used in the transportation and processing of the water, but others may have been present in the original source spring. Either way, you’ll be getting those unwanted tagalongs with the desirable minerals, and there’s no way to separate them."

Call to cancel and they will likely offer you a lower rate.",YouShouldKnow,"Start with the services or credit cards you have had the longest, and then work through all of them. Note how long you have been a customer and that you have made on time payments consistently over that period. Let them know why you are seeking a reduction -- medical bills, between jobs, a desire to pay off your loans, or, best of all, a better offer from a competitor. If they won't give you a better deal on a permanent basis, ask for a temporary break for a year or so.

Do this every three to six months since deals change all the time. Also ask about better rates any time you happen to be on the phone for other reasons, such as for technical assistance. Research deals offered by competitors. Save any offers you receive to use for negotiations.

Always be prepared to cancel services, especially if you aren't really using them. If you aren't sure, you could suspend them for a while and see if you really miss them.

But do be aware that canceling credit cards often could negatively affect your credit score. So you can't just jump around to new credit cards every six months without consequences.

Keep track of your subscriptions and be aware of scams where you are tricked into subscribing or rates suddenly go up dramatically after an introductory period. This is especially important when you autopay -- which is a good practice as long as you keep track of those payments.

**Why YSK:** Customers who call to negotiate the costs of streaming services, insurance premiums, cable bills, cell phone plans, gym memberships, and the APR on credit cards are usually successful in reducing rates. It's worthwhile to take the time to do this every 3-6 months."

1060,"YSK that your teeth and gums are linked directly to your heart, and keeping them healthy by practicing good dental hygiene can help protect your heart, too",YouShouldKnow," **Why YSK:** While dental health is very important in general, one reason that often gets overlooked is that your teeth and gums are directly linked to your heart, and poor dental hygiene can potentially lead to heart problems if left unattended.

Some of those can include:

* Gum disease, which can increase your risk of developing heart disease.
* If you don't take care of your mouth, you risk developing a bacterial infection in your bloodstream. This, in turn, can potentially affect your heart (specifically heart valves -- be very careful if you've had heart surgery to repair/replace them).
* Poor dental care can lead to type 2 diabetes, and there's an apparent link between type 2 and cardiovascular disease.

It's worth noting that more research is needed to determine exactly what the links are, why they occur and how prevalent they are. But studies seem to indicate that they do, at the very least, exist in some capacity, and you can never be too careful when it comes to your health (especially not with your heart).

Practice good dental hygiene by doing some or, ideally, all of the following:

* Brushing your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes at a time (make sure you are brushing all the way to the back).
* Flossing once a day.
* Using mouthwash frequently.
* If possible, use toothpaste with or drink water that contains fluoride.
* See a dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.

Obviously, you can have heart issues regardless of the state of your teeth. And if you *do* have heart issues (of any kind, whether congenital or adult), it's still important to maintain good oral hygiene so that you don't potentially make those problems worse.

Regardless, it's still a good idea to brush your teeth twice a day. It keeps more than just your mouth happy!

When considering paying $0.27 per serving vs $0.14 per serving, you should know that there is very little difference (if any) between most brands and their off-brand, and often times the difference is that the ""off-brand"" retains the better tasting original recipe vs the name brand Cereals cost-cutting, recipe changing, etc;

The Name Brand cereal seems better due to their superior marketing, however in almost every instance (depending on the off-brand) the non-name brand cereal beats the name brand cereal in blind taste tests.

This means that their marketing is working, however they are in reality NOT better, in almost every instance.

**Note:** I **know** there are some cereal off-brands out there which clearly do not match/beat the name brand, however for the most part, the majority of them are identical or better than the original.

And... **With Kellogg firing 1400 workers rather than providing better wages or working environment**, it's important to remember that, for the most part, **your extra $ is going toward their superior marketing and trickery to make their brand seem ""better"", not a truly better product.**

Spend your money in places that share your values, and in this case, on an often identical or superior product. 

Paying more $, in this case does not equal a better product, and in fact only gets you a more commonly marketed name, and often a more poorly performing brand in taste tests."

If you have this as a requirement, I will probably think you're an outdated company that is rigid and has an old mentality. Especially as it relays that they think we have to prove to them they're worthy to work for, when I'm equally trying to figure out if they're worth *my* time. Employers aren't the only ones with power and they can absolutely miss out.

Employers should stop acting like they're doing employees favors just by employing them. It's a business contract; both sides get things and both sides have things to bring to the table. Stop seeing your employees as underlings and accept that we're all equals."

1094,YSK: Apply anti-perspirant at night,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: As a formerly super sweaty teenager with hyperhidrosis learning this was a game changer. Anti-perspirant has to absorb into your skin to work and if you apply it directly after a shower while still wet; or in the morning and sweat it out it will not work (and just stain your tees!)

Applying at night, to clean DRY armpits is key. Even if you start getting sweaty before sleep, once you sleep you usually will sweat less which will allow enough time for the active ingredient to absorb. Once built up this will last days at a time and you can often get form to applying only once a week at night.

This was inspired by the EMSKR and how to apply anti perspirant was way too low on list.

Edit: I should probably mention that antiperspirant shouldn’t be used to prevent normal sweating. It’s a natural part of the body that helps you keep cool. If you are however excessively sweaty, first consider seeing your doctor or dermatologist. If you choose to include an anti perspirant in your routine, it’s most effective when used at  night. You also probably don’t need to use it as often as you think. Usually only every other night or a couple nights a week. Continue to apply normal deodorant in mornings as usual."

This is because even though in Youtubes guide lines of fair use, what they post is ok. But fair use doesn't exist in Japan so big companies like Toei for example would see it just as a copyright violation or stealing products that they made.

**1.)** Insurance will ALWAYS try to offer low first, sometimes leaving you with a balance owed on your old vehicle loan or leaving you unable to replace your vehicle with a vehicle of similar value.

**2.)** They may also try to force you to repair a vehicle which is so damaged that it will be nearly worthless **(or dangerous)** after the repair.

With the price of used (and new) vehicles skyrocketing, insurance companies are pushing heavily to ""repair"" vehicles with fire damage, frame damage, firewall damage, etc; due to the high cost of replacing your vehicle often leaving you with something unsafe and also worthless to any potential buyer in the future.


**What to do:**

**Situation 1.)** Ask the insurance company to provide you with a list of 3 of the exact same trim of vehicle, in the same condition, with the same mileage for the $ they're giving you. They will be forced to give you a proper amount, in order to replace the vehicle you were paying them to insure.

**Situation 2.)** Get an **independent estimate** from a reputable body shop, and if you believe your vehicle is beyond repair and ask the body shop if it were their car, would they repair it? If the answer is ""no"", then fight your insurance company because you're about to get a raw deal..and possibly end up with a vehicle that's now dangerous and also possibly worthless to any lender or any future buyer (or any future insurance payout..)"

1136,YSK: How to tell the difference between tension headaches and migraines as the treatment for them is very different,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: There is a HUGE difference between migraines and tension headaches. Tension headaches are the most common type of headache though most people unknowingly refer to them and treat them as migraines. 

Migraines are a neurological problem and tension headaches are more of a muscular problem. Of course it is much more complicated than this but I’m trying to keep it as basic as possible.

I’ve suffered from tension headaches for the past 7 years that have been so bad they cost me friendships, relationships, and multiple jobs. Because of this I am very educated on tension headaches (but not so much migraines).

Here’s how you can tell if you have tension headaches (and not migraines):

Next time you have a headache take a muscle relaxer than contains ibuprofen (this is usually the purple coloured bottle). Robax platinum or any store brand version will work.  

If you find relief from the muscle relaxer, you have tension headaches, not migraines.

There are many other ways to test it such as using ice and heat as those tend to do good for tension headaches but they can also help some people with migraines, so it’s not a definite answer. 

If the muscle relaxer does not relieve your pain you either have migraines or another type of headaches such as cluster headaches. 

Here are somethings to consider if you have tensions headaches as these are common factors in those that do. Consider fixing them as they can be the cause of your pain:
- do you grind your teeth? 
- are you low on magnesium?
- do you sleep on your side or stomach?
- do you have poor posture? 
- do you have proper tongue posture/where does your tongue sit in your mouth (it’s should be firmly pressed against the roof of your mouth). *not* relaxed. I used  to grind my teeth at night and would try to relax my whole mouth during the day to stop it. In reality this was causing more damage as one of the most important parts of good posture is having your tongue pressing against the roof of your mouth as frequently as possible) 

I have so much more advice but I don’t want to make this post too long. I hope I can help at least one person with this info :)"

Why YSK: it's free, it's legit, and it's your money

Let's say 8 years ago you quit a job. Later, that business discovered you were owed $50 in overtime. Legally, they have to get it to you, but realistically they aren't going to hire a PI to find &amp; verify your identity. Maybe you inherited some stocks/bonds and weren't notified. Where does the money go? Why, the Unclaimed Property Program! 

https://unclaimed.org/search/

Government-run and totally legitimate, it's free to search your name, your business name, your sister's name....anyone's name, and see if they are owed money. I found I was owed hundreds of dollars from my college apartment. My best friend was owed about $75 from an old gig. My current employer had cash from an overpaid utility bill.

It's your money and it's free to get it back. There are BILLIONS OF DOLLARS left unclaimed in the US every year.

This is not a scam. I get nothing from this. You won't be asked to pay a dime - if you are, it's a scam website. Every state has its own. You can search anywhere - make sure to search in states you've lived in the past.

Steps:
Search name - find $$$ - fill out form - get a check in the mail a few weeks later

road is how you drive on it. 90% of drivers listen to music while they’re in the car. Chances are, 
you’re one of them. 
When you drive while listening to some loud music with lyrics, you’re really over-exerting your 
brain which should be focused on the road.
Think about it: when was the last time that one song of yours came up in your Daily Mix? Did 
you have to crank it up? Sing along? Dance a little in your seat? It’s almost impossible not to do
(I know I’m guilty of it more often than I’d like to admit). 
Even though we tell ourselves we’re good drivers and that we can handle it, in reality, we’re 
putting ourselves in a dangerous spot.
Instead, you should really consider putting on some soft acoustic songs the next time you take a 
drive. You’ll be more focused on the road this way, whether you can feel the difference or not.
TL;DR: Loud music with lyrics is distracting. Softer music without lyrics helps you focus on the 
road better. Be smart, drive safe."

1160,"YSK: You should regularly pour white vinegar into your toilet's water cistern/tank to avoid calcium buildup in the toilet's flushing system, which can damage it.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Tap water, which is used to fill a toilet's water tank, can contain a lot of calcium hardness in it. If left unchecked, over time, buildup will form pretty much everywhere in the toilet's flushing system, which will damage the gaskets and other components. 

This also goes for pretty much anything that has tap water running through it in your home. Faucets, dishwasher, washing machine, kettle, shower head, etc. Vinegar is very efficient at getting rid of calcium deposits.

Steps:

1. Turn off the water's supply to the toilet's water tank, there's usually a knob or valve on the wall next to your toilet that you have to turn.
2. Open up the water tank/cistern by removing the top lid. (You may need a screwdriver to do this, depending on the model of your toilet)
3. If the water tank is full, flush the water and empty it. (Because you've turned off the water's supply, it shouldn't fill back up again)
4. Pour white vinegar all over the flushing system and fill half of the tank with it.
5. Fill the remaining half of the tank with hot water (not boiling, slightly hot, max 50°C/120°F temp) and let the mixture do its thing for 15-20 minutes. You should be able to see small bubbles, that's a result of the white vinegar dissolving the deposits.
6. If you have thick hard deposits, use a sponge to scrape off the deposits.
7. Once all the deposits have dissolved, flush it all down the toilet.
8. Turn the water's supply to the toilet's tank back on and put the lid back on.

Do this once a month, or maybe even once a week, depending on how calcareous your tap water is."

1179,YSK: teach children how to be around dogs safely and appropriately. Dog bite injuries are some of the most preventable injuries in childhood.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: as a caregiver it is incredibly important to keep children safe. Dogs are a huge part of many cultures and societies and teaching children the appropriate way to interact with dogs will help them avoid having a bad experience with dogs.

One thing I routinely see as a dog trainer is how many dogs are absolutely terrified of children. It’s not necessarily due to bad experience. Rather, kids move sporadically and unpredictably; they vocalize in unusual patterns. Dogs are used to human movement but children do not move in ways dogs can easily read. Many dogs will not chase an adult out for a run but will chase a child that is running around. This is partially due to the unpredictable nature of the way they move that can activate instincts to herd/chase when they see those kinds of movement patterns. To keep children in your care safe around dogs here are a few simple rules I used to explain to children I worked with:
1) If you see a dog, stop running. Try not to run or skip around dogs. A lot of dogs have herding and chasing instincts, and they may see these sudden movements an invitation to run towards you. They do not want to hurt you but they may also not want to play with you. It is safest for you to never run around when you see a dog. 
2) If a dog is scared of you, it does not mean you have done something wrong. Lots of dogs have had different experiences and do not know whether strangers will be nice to them. 
3) Do not scream or shout near or at dogs, try to lower your voice if you are playing with a dog. Screaming may scare them and many dogs will act defensively when scared. They do not want to hurt you but they may be concerned that you may hurt them.
4) If you want to say hi to a dog and the owner says it is okay, make sure the dog can see your hand. Instead of reaching for the top of their head see if they will let you pet them under the chin. Instead of approaching them from the front, you can try approaching the dog from the side with your hand extended. Dogs will approach each other from the side to indicate non threatening and friendly behavior."

Not many people are aware that *some* hospitals will offer discounts to your bill. You MUST ASK for these discounts, they aren't handed out like candy. Some discounts may be applied simply because you asked and were polite in doing so. Other potentially larger discounts may be applied if you can prove your income is relatively low and you are unable to pay in a timely fashion. Generally speaking, some hospitals will prefer to lower your bill and get you to pay that amount rather than send the full bill to collections. You might want to seek out hospitals that offer these discounts as opposed to ones that do not. 

As an anecdote, I had low wages and a hospital bill a number of years ago. I asked for a discount and got 45% off the bill, as well as 35% off any future bills for a whole year. I did have sign a document attesting to my wages. I had insurance at the time but the bill was slightly less than my deductible."

1196,YSK you are not using your dishwasher the way you are supposed to,YouShouldKnow,"[First and foremost, this video explains this better than me](https://youtu.be/_rBO8neWw04)

&amp;#x200B;

your dishwasher is not designed to use those detergent packs. It needs a little bit of detergent before it actually starts it's wash cycle, and it can't get that with only those packs. Some dish washers have a little prewash ""cup"" for detergent powder, but if it doesn't you can always just sprinkle a little bit of detergent powder on the door. Most dishwashers have a pre wash cycle where the manufacturers expected the user to add a bit of detergent. Doing this will change your dishwashing game FOREVER. I started doing this a while ago, and I rarely have a dish come out of the washer dirty. Even on the top rack.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR ditch the pods switch to powder. It's cheaper, and does a WAY better job.

1200,"YSK: Most dish soaps (like Dawn) are designed to be used in a filled sink, not directly on the sponge.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Some soap companies are changing their formula because so many people wash dishes now one by one, by putting dish soap on the sponge and then scrubbing with running water, rather than filling the sink. If you don’t have a 2 part sink, it makes it harder to wash by hand (maybe consider using a tub), but if you do have 2 sides, fill one side w water and soap, soak dishes, scrub them while submerged, and then rinse them in the other side of the sink. It not only saves on both water and soap, but will get your dishes cleaner."
1201,YSK: Do not put dielectric grease (or bulb grease) on the metal surfaces of a plug. This is the wrong way to use it and could start a fire.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Dielectric grease is an insulator, meaning it does not allow electric current to flow through it. If you apply it to the metal surfaces in a plug, you are making it more difficult for the current to flow through that connection.

The grease has many applications and benefits, but probably the most common use that people are familiar with is for vehicle headlights. You know, that little packet of white grease they upsell you at the counter when you buy new headlight bulbs.

The way you are supposed to use it is apply it around the mating surfaces of the plug, not on the metal contact surfaces. This is meant to keep water from getting inside the connector. Think of it like using caulk to seal an opening.

If you apply it to the metal surfaces, you are increasing resistance which can cause the plug to heat up. Even if you have done this in the past and haven't had any issues, please don't keep doing it because all it takes is that one time where it doesn't wipe enough off and it can cause the plug to melt, or, wort case scenario, start a fire.

I've replaced more headlight plugs than I can count because people unknowingly filled the socket with dielectric grease."

For example, if I save a file today, I would name it “Example Text 20211203”. If I needed to save a new version in the same day, it would be “Example Text 20211203v2”.

Putting the date at the end instead of the front allows your files to be sorted alphabetically&gt;chronologically. Putting the date at the front will sort your files chronologically&gt;alphabetically."

1205,"YSK: the artificial sweetener Xylitol, found in many common household items/food like toothpaste and even peanut butter, is extremely toxic to dogs. If your dog ingests even a small amount, they can die.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: with the obesity epidemic and Keto craze happening in the US, Xylitol use has been on the rise, significantly. It is safe for humans (but will cause diarrhea in large amounts) but CAN kill your dog very quickly unless taken to the vet IMMEDIATELY. When 5mg per 1lb of body weight is ingested, it quickly causes liver failure followed by death and the effects will begin 10-15 minutes after ingesting. Any amount less than this can cause liver cirrhosis, seizures from severe hypoglycemia, tremors, and coma in under an hour. 

This sweetener is found in most “sugar free” snacks, gum, toothpaste, candies, and if you know anyone who follows a Keto Diet or is just simply diabetic, they most likely have a whole bag of the stuff in their cupboard because it tastes and bakes very similar to regular sugar. It’s even in some brands of peanut butter. With the holidays going on and everyone baking sweet treats, I thought I would mention this because until my own dog ate toothpaste with Xylitol, I had NO idea it was so dangerous. She’s fine, now. Thankfully she threw the majority of it up herself. It’s extremely easy for a pup to eat this amount of Xylitol. If you bake a sugar free cake and your dog eats it off the counter while it’s cooling, or you forget to put your toothpaste in the drawer and your curious puppy eats it like puppies do… you could have your heart broken in under an hour. So please be careful! Also never give your pup a homemade treat that you didn’t make yourself!! This info is not well known at all and a good-intending person may use xylitol in place of sugar to make the treats “healthier”. So just be careful, fellow pet owners :)

Instead of trying to reduce masturbating and porn together, just do it without porn, and you’ll be much better.

I used to feel mildly shitty about porn and masturbation, but recently i began simply masturbating without it, and let me tell you I feel great. I enjoy myself more while doing it, feel less gross, and I have realized that I don’t even like pornography. I also only do it when i’m actually horny now. It makes me feel alive and happy and attracted to my partner instead of kinda meh."
1209,YSK: Tortillas are NOT fully cooked yet,YouShouldKnow,"TL;DR: Tortillas fresh out of a bag/package are not fully cooked. Heating them on a hot non-stick, flattop, plancha, or well seasoned cast iron pan for 30 seconds to a minute on each side until light browning and warm/hot is essential for enjoying the tortillas. Store in a clean folded towel or aluminum foil after cooking before eating to retain heat/moisture.

After moving from a town in the southwest United States to a more northern, college town it has become abundantly, even PAINFULLY clear that this is not common knowledge. After seeing scores of undergrads, graduate students and grown people alike reaching their clueless hands towards a half cooked, chewy bitter tortilla for their burrito/taco/etc needs, I have elected to take a stand.

Why YSK: Tortillas are not fully cooked. Corn, Flour, or any other grain that has been wrangled into a circular shape under the name of tortillas do not come fully cooked. If they had been fully cooked prior to being packaged, they would be stiff, crunchy and frankly some unholy center point between a tortilla chip and a malleable, fresh tortilla. Thus the onus falls on you, the consumer to bring these glorious circles of flavor up to the correct temperature, finish the cooking/rising, and bring a bitter/raw flavor of uncooked corn and flour to their glorious savory and delicious conclusion.

How: The best and most traditional way would be a 'plancha' (think: a flat top griddle that gets exceptionally hot), but a non-stick pan or well seasoned cast-iron pan will do the job just as well. Get your choice of heat delivery device rippin' hot (mid-high) and start dropping tortillas. Times will vary based on heat of your burners, type of pan etc, but you should look for some light to medium browning and spots on each side. Tortillas are cheap! Try a few different levels of done-ness to see how you like them.

NOTE: Huge bonus points to use your fingers when grabbing a flipping tortillas. You will make a Mexican/South American grandmother very happy somewhere. The technique varies from surface to surface, but my preferred way is a light pinch to flip, or using the curved edge of the pan and my four fingers to draw it up, allowing my thumb to get under the tortilla and toss it down on the other side. Obviously, don't do anything you are not comfortable with, and this technique benefits from both speed and the presence of ""kitchen fingers"" (Where my food service people at?). This saves scratches on a pan, and is much faster/efficient than some metal tool or spatula.

As soon as the tortilla leaves the griddle, you should be tossing it somewhere that helps it retain its heat and moisture. My personal favorite is making a small foil pouch, pinched on 3 sides with a fold on the forth, that can perfectly be sealed and unsealed as I build a stack of hot and steamy tortillas inside. The same technique can be done with a clean, folded towel. This steam is part of the cooking process, it softens to tortillas up a bit, and helps retain moisture, and finishes the cooking process with the heat. (In fact this is a great technique for many other foods. ever wonder why ballpark hotdogs, wrapped burritos, wrapped burgers taste so good? Part of that process is letting the heat from the steam and meat flow into the bread and keep it warm and moist. A good technique for other items too!)

Take these tortillas out as you are ready to eat them.

BONUS:

carniceria/tortilleria : While most places may not have access to one of these stores, it is worth a quick map search. Tortillas from actual Latino/Hispanic grocers are much better than anything from a grocery store. Same rules apply for finishing cooking these tortillas. Plus, you will be supporting small businesses! These stores additionally often have a plethora of other Latin/Hispanic ingredients, seasonings, meats, pastries etc. and are often cheaper than chain grocery store equivalents (and better tasting!). Be kind and respectful of culture and language here too. I have never had a negative experience even though my Spanish is 'mierda', and the same service industry rules apply here: Hardworking people deserve respect and empathy, so don't be an asshole. Should go without saying, but still."

1211,YSK: There's a free and easy way to automate routine office tasks.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Nearly every office I've ever been in has done so many boring, repetitive things by hand. Spending just a couple of days learning the basics of a scripting language like Python can cut hours of tedious work out of your routine. Computers are really good at monotonous things, so if there's something you do the exact same way every day at work, there's probably a decent way to automate it.

1212,YSK: driving slow isn't always the same as driving safe,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: there are a lot of situations where driving fast is safer than driving slow. 

For example if you're passing something, especially something like a truck with high winds, it's safest to pass it as quickly as possible. I always use the rule of thumb that passing should take 10 seconds maximum.

Another example is with weather that causes bad sight (think heavy fog or rain) a lot of people just slam their brakes. But it's way safer to just keep driving the recommended speed, since that makes you predictable. If you don't trust the poor vision, go to the right lane and gradually lower your speed, if you plan to go slower than 80 km/h on the highway turn on your hazards.

Read the situation on the road, sometimes speeding up/not slowing down is the right course of action. (Note: read sometimes. Don't go blasting 200 on the daily just because of this post)"

1215,YSK - Conflict of Interest with Human Resouces?,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Conflict of interest, especially in a small organization may be confusing.

My colleagues and I were bouncing around a discussion. We are a small company - about 40 people. We have a single HR person. One of the many committees that this HR person sits on is a ""Project Prioritization Management Committee"". Basically, it's a committee to make sure that one of the departments is keeping up with their projects. I raised the question that I think it is a conflict of interest - especially considering the fact that the department's annual reviews, etc. are dependent on some of these projects. I know technically this could be a legal question, but in reality, to me, it's more of an ethical question.

Am I wrong in thinking that the HR person should not be on this committee?"

1240,YSK Weight loss is not as simple as calories in vs calories out.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: It is still widely believed that weight loss is as simple as calories in vs calories out, but there's more to the story. Permanent long term weight loss needs to address the contributing factors.

For thousands of years humans were eating far less regularly and with far less complex carbohydrates. Our modern diets of excessive sugars and carbs and culture of frequent meals and snacking has led to the obesity epidemic. It's not as easy as calories in calories out if you understand how your body actually stores and burns calories.

For many overweight and obese people, increasing insulin sensitivity is key to weight loss. Every time you eat a meal or snack you spike insulin which tells your body to store excess calories. 

Increased levels of insulin in your blood stream makes your body less sensitive to it so your body produces more and more insulin telling your body to store more calories long term as fat cells. 

It's much harder for your body to access fat stores when you are insulin resistant. Lowering calorie intake and increasing exercise while being insulin resistant leads to lower metabolism as you body thinks there are less calories available.

The key for long term weight loss is to address insulin sensitivity in addition to calorie restriction. This is done by reducing your feeding window  and eating less frequently during the day allows your body to burn the calories on hand and then burn the calories stored as fat. Paired with a lower carbohydrate diet makes less glycogen available so that your body accesses your fat stores faster. Commonly known as fasting or intermittent fasting.

It's odourless and colourless, so it's very hard to detect.   For this reason, it's always a good idea to ensure your fire detector/smoke alarm also has CO detection  (most of the newer fire detectors come standard with this nowadays).      


I'm making this post because I noticed a lot of black soot (black powdery substance) building up on the bottom of my girlfriend's pots and pans when we cook at her condo.  I also have a gas range stove at my place but have never seen build-up of soot on my cooking equipment.  This soot will come off as black dust on your finger if you rub the bottom of a pan after it cools.  Recently, the CO alarm went off on the smoke detector at my girlfriend's place, which obviously caused some concern and I started to look into the potential causes while she called the fire department.  Be sure to get out of the house and/or ventilated it by opening the windows.  Getting out of the home right away is the safest option and highly recommended. 

One of the best articles I found was this one:   [https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/](https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/)

The article shows that soot can be a sign that your natural gas stove is has an incorrect mixture of air and gas, which can lead to an incomplete burn.  This incomplete burn can cause the build-up of soot and carbon monoxide in your home.   While this typically creates CO in amounts that are not deadly, they can cause a lot of health problems over time and if the ventilation in your home is poor, it can potentially be fatal. 

Some symptoms of CO poisoning are headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, weaknesss, confusion, and nausea.  If you have any of these symptoms that seem to clear up when you leave home, check the bottom of your pots and pans for clues.    The article above goes into a lot better detail than I ever could, and I'm definitely no expert in this field.   I figured this could be life-saving information and was worth a share.     If anyone who's an expert in this that has corrections for my info and/or more information on this, I encourage you to share it in the thread.

Inflation is often shown as year over year percentage change. Do not be fooled by the government when the inflation is “transitioned” into 2% the following year.

For example, an item that costs 100 dollar in 2020 will cost 106 dollar in 2021 with 6% inflation, but will costs 108.12 dollar in 2022 with 2% inflation."

1267,YSK how to use the apostrophe because the English-writing world usually can't,YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK how to use the apostrophe:**

Misusing the apostrophe reflects badly on your writing and therefore on you.

The apostrophe is clearly an enigma for people writing in English. One of the biggest errors is using *it's* when *its* is the needed word. Just remember that *it's* is the contraction for *it is.*

Apple does not help us out with the apostrophe; the default there is *it's* I asked someone who worked at Apple why Apple chose this route, and he said, ""Because the programmers are idiots"" --harsh words for sure, but do know in school and the workplace, mistakes with *it's* and *its* reflect badly on you.

**NOTE:** *Its* shows ownership: (1)The company lost its license or (2) The hospital has closed its emergency room (3) Avoid adding the Japanese barberry to your home landscaping; its invasive nature has caused some states to ban this plant."
1268,YSK: 3rd party sellers are abusing lax rating standards on trusted company websites in order to make themselves look like reliable sellers.,YouShouldKnow,"**WHY YSK:** Places like W@lamart allow 3rd party sellers to sell on their websites. The company doesn't limit reviews to verified buyers allowing the sellers to give themselves 100s of positive ratings, often without comments, in order to reach a trusted status. 

Even a savvy computer shopper can confuse a 3rd party sale with one coming from the actual company. Instead of promised 2 and 3 day shipping, these companies take several days before eventually shipping via USPS. 

Promised new electronics are actually used and/or in damaged boxes. Name brand clothing turns out to be cheap knockoffs. 

Amazon tries to limit the number of fake reviews by requiring reviews be made by verified purchasers but the sellers get around it by offering refunds to people who give good ratings or change the product on the page from a popular highly rated item to garbage. Ever notice everything on Amazon is rated 4.5 stars? Sort reviews by new and get the real ratings. 

Even if the majority of these products are returned, they're selling garbage at a huge markup and disappear or change names before the bills can be paid. 

Take an extra minute to confirm you are not buying from a 3rd party before hitting checkout. Youll save yourself a lot of hassle."

1273,YSK that taking a deep breath to calm down works better with diaphragmatic breathing,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: If you’re trying to calm down, especially during a panic attack, diaphragmatic or belly breathing is what will help you relax. Thoracic or chest breathing is better for physical exertion and may actually make you more tense. [(Source: Mayo Clinic)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/decrease-stress-by-using-your-breath/art-20267197)

From the link above, for those who don’t want to read the whole thing: 

•Get into a comfortable position. Close your eyes and bring your attention to your body and breath.

•Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your abdomen to fill with air, gently expanding out. Exhale by relaxing and releasing all of the air through your nose.

•Place one hand on your abdomen, right below your navel, and the other hand on your upper chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your nose. Feel the coolness of the air as it enters in and the warmth as it flows out.

•As you breathe in and out through your nose, focus on shifting your breath so that you can feel the rise and fall of your breathing in your abdomen more than in your chest. In other words, make the hand that rests on your abdomen move more than the hand on your chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose, sending it through the back of your throat and down to your belly. Let your abdomen slowly deflate as you exhale through your nose.

•Take three more slow, deep breaths with conscious focus on the rise and fall of your abdomen. Continue to breathe fully and deeply, allowing and trusting the body as the breath slows and becomes more relaxed."

1277,YSK: SciHub is a free recourse to get access to the majority of research papers,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: So many journal articles in science specifically are locked behind extreme paywalls, especially recently published papers with exciting information. I've seen paywalls that range from $50-$200 just to get access to one article. SciHub was founded by a Kazakhstan woman, Alexandra Elbakyan, to make scientific information more accessible to the general public. As a STEM major, I look through tons of research papers every week and a friend of mine recently told me about this, so I wanted to share incredible resource for anyone who is unaware, especially people in the scientific community."
1278,"YSK: If you're watching an old movie or tv show and they mention money, multiply by 10 if it's black and white to get somewhere in the ballpark of what it would be today",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: In our economic system, inflation is pretty much built in to the economy, and sometimes it's quite significant. Knowing how much money people are talking about in the past can add to your understanding of the times and the stakes back then. Occasionally there has been deflation, usually associated with financial catastrophe.

Here's [a link to an inflation calculator](https://www.aier.org/cost-of-living-calculator/) to pin down a more precise value.

For example, I just watched an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents where a priest accidentally ends up winning $2,100 on the horses. That seems like an okay amount, but running it through the inflation calculator puts at almost $19,000 today, a sum that could make a big difference. In the episode it was implied the priest would use it to fix a leaky roof in the tabernacle.

Even that isn't entirely accurate, because different goods and services often inflate at different rates, but it still gets you in the ballpark. Also, if you go back to 1935, the multiplier is closer to 20x."

1285,"YSK: When people recommend boycotting a company, they do not mean go burn/throw out all the products you’ve already purchased from them. They’re simply asking you to not purchased products from said company moving forward.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: When you burn or throw out products from the company, you’re in no way hurting them, and just wasting money you’ve already spent. Throwing out all your cereal or crackers or whatever it may be that you own literally does nothing for the cause. You’ve spent YOUR money on it, and that company has already received THEIR money from that purchase. Burning it or throwing it out does not make that money they’ve already received go away. They still have it, and now you’re out a perfectly good package of cookies. 

When people recommend boycotting a company, they do not mean go waste your money and throw out your already paid for belongings out. They just want to encourage you to no longer buy products from them so moving forward they no longer get money from you. When a large percentage of the population is no longer buying things from a company that is either being unethical, doing illegal things, not treating their employees fairly and so on, it hurts that company’s bottom line, takes away from their income and gets societies point across that we are unwilling to tolerate such blatant manipulation or wrongdoings. It puts your money where your mouth is, outside of their banks and into better companies. 

I’ve seen way too many videos recently of people setting their food products from certain companies or fire, tossing them in the rubbish bin and other creative ways of disposing of things. I just wanted to remind you guys that this does nothing for the cause, and at the end of it you’re just out money you earned and spent on it. I understand it might make y’all feel good or satisfied, in which case carry on, but the point is simply to not spend any more money on said company. That’s it.

If you want to do more than that, try making a sign and standing in front of the grocery stores parking lots, share a post online about what the company is doing wrong, talk to your friends and family about jumping on the boycott wagon with you. There’s more ways to make a difference and help get a message across to the masses and a company that don’t involve you burning your money or throwing it in the trash. It’s wasteful and pretty silly in my opinion.

Just my prerogative. That is all my friends. Stay safe and have a great day!"

1291,"YSK - As weather gets colder, it is absolutely vital you are careful with antifreeze; making sure it is kept safely in your shed and clean up any spills. Antifreeze kills cats in tiny amounts, and most taste good to kitties (and dogs) so they will continue eating it.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

The smallest amount of antifreeze can kill cats, and kill them horribly. Signs can show with 30 minutes of ingestion; they begin to stumble like they are drunk, start to find breathing difficult. They vomit, they can have seizures. Finally, their kidneys give out. It is absolutely horrific for pet and owner.

I know this from experience, having lost [two cats](https://imgur.com/gallery/4ZzwTLh) to antifreeze poisoning in the space of one week.

It's also vital to know [the symptoms](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/cats/health/poisoning/antifreeze) of antifreeze poisoning, as depending on dosage it only takes 2-3 days for your kitty's kidneys to fail, and the cat to pass.

Please please please, save a cat this Christmas. Store, dispose of and use any antifreeze safely, or buy pet-safe antifreeze (that doesn't contain ethylene glycol)."
1292,"YSK, wary, weary, leery are all different words",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK, wary and leery both mean ""cautious about a potential problem"". Weary means ""tired"". 

Over and over you see people say they are ""weary"" of a problem, that's because they are conflating wary and leery, two words that means roughly the same thing, but combining those words leaves you with ""weary"", which, again, just means tired. You are not tired of the problem, you are sceptical of the problem, so either wary or leery is what you mean. 
Unless the issue has exhausted you, you aren't ""weary"" of it, you're ""wary"" or ""leery"" of it. Learn the difference and you won't sound like a tool."

It is important to not overwater your houseplants as they can grow mold, mildew, or be susceptible to fungus and other diseases with excessive water. 

A good rule of thumb is to touch the soil with your finger to see if the substrate is moist, and avoid watering again until it is dry. 

Also, leaf tips can go brown from cold. Do not cut these off until warmer weather arrives, as this is one of the plant’s protection against frost. They essentially write off a part of themselves to take the damage from the cold in order to protect the rest of them. 

Good luck, and happy gardening!"

1312,YSK that the color of the warning lights on your car's dashboard indicate the urgency of the problem,YouShouldKnow,"Some cars have weird, confusingly shaped lights on the dash, or maybe you just didn't read the manual. Either way, you don't necessarily need to know what every light means as long as you pay attention to the color.

Green: Non issue, just a notification. Things like fog lights, or ready to move on hybrids.

Amber: Non urgent issue. These are for issues that are OK to continue driving with, but should be fixed soon. Things like check engine, ABS failure, traction control failure, tire pressure, etc.

Red: Urgent issue. These are for issues that pose an immediate serious danger to you or the car. If a red light comes on, stop immediately. Things like no oil pressure, overheating, or brake failure, or charging system failure.

Charging system failure may sound like that should be an amber light, but there's a good reason it's red. It's rare for an alternator to just die all of a sudden, so that could also indicate a broken serpentine belt, which would also stop your water pump and power steering pump. It could also indicate an electrical fault that could, in serious cases, start a fire. Even if it's neither of those, when your battery dies, you are stranded. So that's why it's red.

Why YSK:  If you don't know what all the lights in your car mean, just knowing what the color means can save you a lot of money and avoid dangerous situations."

1314,YSK the lyrics to a much better birthday song for all ages.,YouShouldKnow,"*Futurama* ep. 2:14 features an original song recited for Lord Nibbler's birthday.

*What day is today?*

*It's Nibbler's birthday!*

*What a day for a birthday!*

*Let's all have some cake!*

These lyrics were written for TV in order to avoid infringing the copyright for ""Happy Birthday"", but they are good enough to replace ""Happy Birthday"" entirely if adopted by the public.

Why YSK: Saying the phrase ""Happy birthday to you"" four times in a row is boring and embarassing for everyone involved, and is often thought of as the least fun part of a birthday party. These lyrics are more fun and creative, and they touch on the most exciting themes for a child: special occasions, attention, and cake."

Police stations are just about the safest place you can meet publicly, and also act as a filter against people with bad intentions.

I'm currently selling a high-priced item as a private party, and told a prospective buyer who wanted to see the item that he should meet me at my local police station.  He refused, and suggested a McDonald's parking lot in a sketchy neighborhood instead.  His refusal to meet at the police station sounded my alarm bells, especially when he couldn't articulate his objections to meeting there.  I called off the deal with him, and instead went with the next prospective buyer who not only had no objections to meeting at the police station, but expressed his appreciation for doing so at such a safe place.

P.S.  Many police stations not only support this activity, but some will also provide a police officer to be present during the transaction upon request."

1343,"YSK products with down insulation (coats, jackets, vests, pillows, comforters, etc) may use feathers from live-plucked duck and geese.",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK:**

* You may be considering purchasing down-insulated products during the holiday season
* You may not know that the geese and duck feathers are plucked while they are still alive, often several times over the course of their life. 
* Even if you aren't vegan, you may not want to support this a cruel and inhumane process. 
* It can take feathers from 10-20 geese or duck to make a single down coat
* There are alternatives and more ethical sources of down you can consider

**Alternatives**

Many companies offer alternatives (and many have even banned using down altogether) There are several ways to search for down-alternative products. Usually they will have keywords such as:

* Synthetic Insulation
* ""Down-Alternative""
* ""Featherless""
* Recycled Insulation
* Cotton or Rayon Filled

**Ethically-Sourced Down Options**

There are currently 2 certification standards for ethical down retrieval that work to combat this issue, RDS and GTDS.

**RDS -** [Responsible Down Standard](https://certifications.controlunion.com/en/certification-programs/certification-programs/rds-responsible-down-standard) is utilized by most ethically-aware companies, however even this standard has many flaws. 

* Farm inspections are announced in advance
* RDS allows for parallel farm operation (RDS and non-RDS down produced on the same farm) 
* RDS does not consider the parent farm (where the geese are hatched and raised)

**GTDS -** [Global Traceable Down Standard](https://d2evkimvhatqav.cloudfront.net/documents/su_traceble_down_infopaper.pdf) is only utilized by Patagonia in partnership with the NSF, and is a much stricter certification."

1386,YSK that the name on your medical records needs to match the name on your insurance card,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: People are often upset that their medical records do not match their preferred name, or that medical professionals address them by a name other than their preferred name. The name used in the EMR needs to match the name on your insurance card, otherwise insurance can deny your claim. This may mean that:

- Your medical records have your full name (ex. Robert) when you go by a nickname (ex. Bob)
- Your medical records have your dead name when you use a chosen name
- Your medical records have only your first initial, rather than your first name
- Your medical records have a misspelling of your name (usually, if the name is long and the last letter(s) are cut off on the insurance card)

Please don’t take out any frustration at this policy on your medical team, as they are doing their best to make sure that you get the insurance coverage you’re paying for. 

You CAN:

- ask that your preferred name (and pronouns, if applicable) be entered into the preferred name field or the EMR message
- politely remind/correct members of the team, especially if it is the first time they are speaking with you.

Being called the wrong name can cause people to feel distressed or alienated. Please know that using the incorrect name on your medical record is almost certainly due to your insurance.

1410,YSK that insurance companies often offer free memberships or discounts on memberships for the gym,YouShouldKnow,"I* posted this same subject a couple years ago, but I recently saw a post on Reddit discussing the outrageous costs of gyms people were paying so i figured I would share again. *

New Years is around the corner and that means that many people start going to the gym again or start at the gym for the first time. If you fall into this category (or currently have an overpriced gym membership) check with your health insurance provider to see if they offer any gym membership deals BEFORE signing up for any gym. Insurance companies know that they will likely save money long term having customers who are in better shape and thus often have deals on gym memberships. Personally, my insurance offers a program that costs me $25/m and in return I receive a nationwide membership to Planet Fitness, anytime fitness, LA fitness, Snap, Crunch, and a ton of other small and local gyms, or I may choose one single gym for free. Personally, I chose the $25/m program and in total, I get access to over 11k fitness facilities nationwide, which is great for when I travel or go on vacation and still wish to get to the gym. It would cost me hundreds of dollars a month to have the same access. My insurance is certainly not the only one. Some companies may not offer as good as options but are normally still cheaper than going through the gym directly. I know not everyone has health insurance and that’s not a discussion I wish to get into, but for those who do and wish to get a gym membership, definitely check with your provider first.

Why YSK: it is almost always cheaper to go through your insurance company (if they offer memberships) for your gym membership than to go through the gym directly."

1421,"YSK that the average reading age in the US is that is that of a 13 year old, so when writing something for mass communication you should keep your language clear, simple, and unambiguous",YouShouldKnow,"So firstly I need to say a couple of things.

I'm not picking on the US, it's just the majority of people on CV Reddit are from there. I'm from the UK and our reading age is lower at 9 years, so it's not a dunk:

Here's a good link which is talking about my point:
https://centerforplainlanguage.org/what-is-readability/#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20is%20considered,readability%20level%20of%20age%20nine.

Secondly some people try to link reading age to intelligence which just isn't the case. People with a low reading age can be very intelligent. There are many difficulties that people struggle with that can impair their reading age, but doesn't affect how intelligent they are.

Why YSK: If you want to get your message across to the widest number of people you *have* to use simple language, you can't assume everyone has the same vocabulary.

1434,"YSK: The American ""imperial"" system is different to the actual imperial system used elsewhere",YouShouldKnow,"The US imperial system, actually called the US Customary System, has key differences to the imperial system when it comes to measuring volume. A fluid ounce is 28.41ml in British Imperial but 29.57ml in US Customary units. An imperial pint is 20 fl. oz. compared to 16 fl. oz. in the US and an imperial gallon is 160 fl. oz. compared to 128 fl. oz. in the US. 

Why YSK: there are plenty of places where this is relevant, such as fuel prices and value for money, but in a word, baking. When following online recipes it is easy to mistake one for the other, for example for people in the UK who use both imperial and metric at different times, or for people in Canada where there's a lot of US imports, and this can lead to irredeemable mistakes with some of the more unforgiving recipes. If you're following an online recipe try to make sure you know which type of pints/fluid ounces is being used. A dead giveaway for US Customary units is Cups, as Cups are not used in the imperial system."

1441,YSK the difference between 'sweet' and 'sweat',YouShouldKnow,"'Sweet' has a long 'e' sound like in the word 'meet.' It is used to describe something that has the taste characteristic of sugar or honey, or describe something pleasant or delightful.

'Sweat' has a short 'e' sound like in the word 'meant.' It is the stuff your skin excretes when you are too warm.

Why YSK: if you call someone 'sweaty' over a text when you meant to call them 'sweety' it can be confusing or insulting."
1442,"YSK when calculating units like MPH or Hourly wages, the formula is contained within the unit name itself.",YouShouldKnow,"In this scenario, ""Per"" is essentially equivalent to ""Divided by,"" so you can quickly calculate the unit by replacing 'Per' with '÷'

A few examples:

Miles Per Hour = Miles÷Hours; 100miles÷2hours = 50MPH

Price Per Ounce = Price÷Ounces; $1÷4 Ounces = $0.25 Per Ounce

Dollars Per Hour = Dollars÷hours; $120÷8 hours = $15 Per Hour

Why YSK: This can help in daily life, whether shopping at the farmers market, or getting an estimate of how much time it will be until you reach your destination (requires a little more math, but this is an integral part). Additionally, many people get this formula mixed up and it helps to be able to quickly check it yourself. You'll find that some labeled unit prices at grocery stores are often wrong because the employee creating those labels got mixed up. I've also seen hourly wages shared incorrectly because they calculated hours÷dollars. 

Put simply, this is a piece of knowledge too many people don't understand. So even if running these calculations isn't your job, being able to check the work of those whose job it is can help you make well-informed decisions."

If you wish for a refund, you'll first have to file a complaint with the airline's customer complaint department. If they deny your request, then you'll want to [file a complaint with the US Department of Transportation.](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/file-consumer-complaint) 

The reason I know this is because I had this happen to me with an airline. They cancelled my flight, and then denied my request for a refund. I gather all my documentation together (original itinerary, flight cancellation, airline rejecting my refund request) and filed a complaint with USDT and had my refund within a few weeks. I can't guarantee that it will work, but it did for me. The moment the airline saw I had actually filed a complaint, I was escalated to another level of customer support and received my refund."
1446,"YSK that in the United States, you as an individual cannot charge someone with a crime. Only prosecutors can.",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK**. In the criminal justice system, a prosecutor is the only person who can charge someone with a crime. Despite the popularity of the idea that you can ""press charges,"" that's not the reality. Police or prosecutors may ask you if you want to press charges, but that's really just them determining whether they'll have a cooperative witness in deciding to make an arrest, or whether they should let it go.

Also, while some states have laws that allow for private criminal prosecutions, these are exceptionally rare and still require the involvement of prosecutors.

Why YSK: You can come off as ignorant and even maybe even rude (to some people) saying ”Happy Hanukkah” 2-3 weeks after the holiday is over.
So try to avoid saying it to your Jewish friends on Christmas! Save yourself the embarrassment.
Hanukkah, and other Jewish holidays follow the Lunisolar calendar, hence why every year Jewish holidays happen on different dates on the Georgian calendar."

1453,YSK when approaching a stop light on a two lane highway and the road widens to four Lanes you should fill in the right lane even with the left lane,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: using both Lanes allows more traffic to cross the intersection in less time allowing better traffic flow. (Similar to the zipper method when a lane is closed).

Pardon the wall of text. I'm on mobile. 

This is the United States, may be different in other countries. 


When a two lane road meets a higher traffic road it often opens to four Lanes at the stop light then reduces back to two Lanes shortly after. 


This is done on purpose to allow more traffic through the green. 


Most people stick to the left lane either because they think it is rude to pass so many people or perhaps they want to allow people turning right the chance to do it on red. 


This defeats the entire purpose of the widening of the road. So from now on when coming to a red light and the road widens feel free to take that right lane and pass all the other fools waiting in line. Just don't be a jerk when merging back in."

In reality, it's just another shady tactic by cable providers to keep you on the hook for their insane cable costs.

I myself had been thinking of cutting the cord and switching to internet only, but noticed that my only internet option that was showing online was a $300/month 3000 Mbps option with literally nothing slower or cheaper even offered. I contacted Comcast and they informed me that I was likely seeing only that option because of my ""current plan"" and that I'd need to call a certain number to downgrade. Of course that number had a highly trained sales rep who fed me a bunch of crappy bundle offers that didn't fill my needs at all until I just told her to downgrade to Gigabit internet only.

Most places offer a little incentive for these reviews but many places may increase the employees pay. It looks very well on yearly reviews when someone shows their supervisor that they have “X” amount of positive reviews which result in repeat customer or referrals to most consumers which equals more profit.

Take a second and leave a good review for someone today, it can definitely do more than a few bucks would ever do."

1472,"YSK as a Pediatrician, passing out antibiotics is easy.",YouShouldKnow," 

As a Pediatrician, it's the easiest thing in the world for me to give your child antibiotics (ABX) for what is likely a viral illness. I have dozens of patients each week who come in with symptoms and complaints that are likely a viral illness. I explain in detail viral illnesses to family but in the end, it seems most want antibiotics. I even have patients who will then go to urgent care the next day, usually not seeing a Pediatrician, and will then get ABX or steroids as those places pass it out like candy.

I can easily give antibiotics. In fact, if I give ABX, I can justify billing at a higher level to insurance (99214 vs a 99213). I not only make more money, but parents leave happier. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. When I don't give ABX to a family, not only do I risk parents not being happy and leaving me a poor review, but I then likely will have to dedicate time for phone call follow ups as these families tend to call for ongoing symptoms (need to let the viral illness run its course). I understand it's tough to take a day off from work and take your kid to the doctor just to be told to continue supportive care, but its the right thing to do.

So please parents, when I don't prescribe ABX, I do it truly because I care about your child. I have seen children have horrible Clostridium Difficile infections for ABX. I have seen a young girl with UTIs that are now resistant to almost every oral ABX, and she now requires to be routinely admitted for IV ABX.

**Why YSK:** Passing out ABX like candy is the easy way out. I don't do it cause I truly care about the wellbeing of your child.

1475,YSK: Contacting a companies feedback team can sometimes be much more effective than dealing with the manager/staff physically on site. Making a habit of positively/negatively reviewing a place on a public platform can also yield results.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: If there's one thing 2021 has shown us time and time again, it's that some establishments have serious staff/managerial issues. This can be through no fault of their own sometimes, especially if corporate doesn't weigh in on matters correctly.

How do we stop corporations from passing the buck to locations/consumers? By putting the ball back in their court and contacting them directly. This creates a trail of evidence, where if needed you could publicly share transcripts of the positive/negative way the issue was resolved.

I would like to believe that businesses don't aim to cut corners. What do you do though when the manager refuses to help you, or perhaps they themselves may be the problem. Where do you go to get some accountability, and perhaps give staff the resources/support they need? Social and email support have changed the dynamic completely. 

I recently contacted the feedback team for a popular coffee chain I had grown frustrated with. I told them about the discrepancies in quality/service, and how I observed unsafe practices taking place. They are a national chain, and new to my area and although the staff acknowledged my concerns I never saw anything change until I contacted corporate online. 

I was surprised to see one of the issues I brought up was directly addressed upon my next visit. They had posted a notice to put patrons at ease. It's amazing how simply posting a sign or seeing an improvement in quality can change your experience completely. One might argue this harms a corporations bottom line which could have ""trickle down"" effects. IMO the consumer shouldn't be the one who settles for less, especially if they aren't asking for something unreasonable."

1486,YSK about Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and that there is a free 8 week course available to anyone,YouShouldKnow,"
https://palousemindfulness.com

From their introduction:
""Mindfulness is about being fully awake in our lives. It is about perceiving the exquisite vividness of each moment."" - Jon Kabat-Zinn


For most of us, when this happens, it's unexpected, maybe while walking on a mountain trail on a crisp autumn day, or being so focused in work or play that you are not thinking about past or future, or connecting with someone in a way that makes it seem like time is standing still. This state of being alive and whole in the present moment is always available, but it typically eludes us, especially in times of difficulty and external pressures.


""Mindfulness"" is used in many contexts nowadays and there are many different understandings of the term. Diana Winston of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center gives my favorite definition: Paying attention to present moment experience with open curiosity and a willingness to be with what is.


Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a blend of meditation, body awareness, and mindful movement: learning through practice and study how your body handles (and can resolve) stress neurologically.

A few ounces should be fine, but wait to drink large quantities for about 30 minutes after eating.⁵   
 Disclaimer: This will not eliminate the risk of food poisoning, just reduce it. To greatly reduce the risk, properly cook and store it, and don't eat food that sat out for more than 2 hours.⁶

 You probably eat too fast. The saliva released when chewing helps food go down. Try chewing more.

1543,YSK charging your phone/device overnight is damaging your battery,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: The perpetuating myth of having to fully charge and fully discharge your battery to ""erase battery memory"" is wrong, it's a leftover myth from the days of lead-acid batteries, most batteries in most devices these days use Li-ion cells. 

The optimal charge/discharge cycle of most lithium ion batteries is usually 50%-60%, but you don't want to be constantly plugging and unplugging your phone/device all the time, a healthy compromise is charging it between 20%-80% to reduce the risks of corrosion, gas leakage within the battery, cracking of the electrodes, and generally extend the lifespan of your battery 

Do NOT charge your phone overnight, you might be tempted to wake up on a full charge, you might have a long day waiting for you, but if you wanna keep your phone/device around for longer than 1-2 years with great battery health, don't charge your phone overnight, as voltage within the battery increases whilst charging, pushing a current through becomes harder and harder, [as the current passthrough in the battery sharply declines at usually 70%](https://imgur.com/a/8jGQyPI) (image courtesy of Battery University), imagine a balloon, you're trying to inflate it, it becomes increasingly harder to pump air through as the balloon expands, this is (roughly) what happens when your phone battery reaches a high percentage (trust me I took electromagnetics in college lol) 

Do not use fast chargers, unless you really have to, this may be understood using the same analogy I used above, when pumping air into a balloon really fast, the material becomes more prone to cracking and disintegration, same thing happens with [Li-ion batteries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020740318329588), as well as, fast chargers are usually much faster in the early stages of charging, but the speed deteriorates really fast when you reach 50% or in other cases 70%, that's why you hear manufacturers in their product launches say something like ""charges up to 70% in 30 minutes"" instead of mentioning how long it takes to charge from 0%-100%. 

This is slightly unrelated, but when your phone battery is about to die, do not turn it off completely, instead put it in battery saver mode, as the turn on/turn off procedure sucks up a considerable amount of juice in relation to the amount of battery consumed when on battery saver mode, [in extreme cases some Android phones have an ultra or extreme power saver mode](https://www.androidheadlines.com/how-enable-ultra-power-saving-mode-battery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21?amp) it's good to take a look around in your settings to find this feature. 

I've been living by these rules for the past 6 years, I'm a [hobbyist photographer](https://imgur.com/a/a75uYQd) and I exclusively use Lightroom on my iPhone, [reporting more than 7.5 hours of daily usage lol](https://imgur.com/a/S6Dz9td) whilst managing to keep my battery health at a [comfortable 92%](https://imgur.com/a/4z8jl2k) after 2+ years of extensive daily usage.

1544,YSK: That little gift is often what sustains a teacher...,YouShouldKnow,"I teach preschool. My school does not pay a lot (31k with a masters degree) but this is just the area we live in, this is how it is- and the cost of living is high. 
I can’t move to a better area due to family constraints with caring for aging parents. 
I love my job so much and it is what I’m meant for. Teaching these little ones is my dream come true. 
But anyway, usually at Christmas and sometimes Thanksgiving and Teacher Appreciation, I get little presents from the parents of my kids. Nothing huge to where it could be considered inappropriate, of course (and maybe it’s different if you teach older students but mine are so young), but they have given me little things like candy, small gift cards, sometimes food items like a loaf of sweet bread. And while they think they just brightened up my day with a fun gift, what they don’t realize it that little gift is actually what sustains me— I have had times where I was eating their gift and it helped because I didn’t have much food left at home, or times the little gift card they gave meant I could afford one more item at the grocery store. I never tell students or families about how broke we are teaching their kiddos, but anyway my point is- 

Why YSK: If your child has a teacher you appreciate and you bring them something little because you want to brighten their day, just know you are doing more than you think- you may be helping them make it."

Meaning, they are assuming based on the fact that you endorsed the check that the source of the check is reliable, even if the check you're cashing isn't legitimate. 
 I was recently scammed for a lot of money based on my misunderstanding of how checks function, and now I owe my bank the money that these bounced checks offered because I already spent it. This is a common scam these days. Someone pretending to be an employer sends you checks to cover work supplies, then they get you to send your real money along to ""suppliers"" via Google pay or through cryptocurrencies. Then the checks get flagged as fictitious days later, and you're left with a huge bill that the bank won't help you cover. I may be particularly naive about these sorts of things, but nobody ever taught me that checks get cashed before the bank has verified that they're real, and I never want anyone to make the same mistake I did. I would honestly say that you should never accept checks as payment for anything based on this understanding, unless it's from a close friend or family member. Your bank isn't there to help you. They're there to facilitate money changing hands. It's not their business if the check isn't legitimate. The first you'll hear about it is when you see huge amounts of money being debited to your account as they discover the checks are fake."

1563,YSK: You are not your thoughts or emotions,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Believing you are your thoughts and emotions leads to a lot of needless self-criticism and anxiety. It's important to be mindful of thought patterns and how they correlate to behaviors, but I'm speaking entirely about what's in your head.

***I want to be clear that I am not saying the thoughts and emotions of, let's say, depression are not deeply painful experiences. But you are not wrong, bad, or to blame for experiencing them, and there is no need to entangle it with your identity.***

YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS and they do not dictate who you are or if you're good person or not. You cannot control the thoughts that go through your mind minute-to-minute. It's okay to acknowledge you don't want to be thinking about certain things, or that a feeling you're having is painful, but fighting it is only going to cause them to pile up. We don't want thoughts and emotions to run our lives via impulsive behaviors. However, they are still completely natural and necessary functions, so it's important not to negate them either.

Instead, try cognitive diffusion. It trains you to experience thoughts and emotions while observing them at a distance, as something separate from yourself. Over time you will be less reactionary, and can just sit back and watch. You will be able to endure emotions like you're a curious scientist deciphering data, and you may find that a lot of it isn't significant, and be able to let it go. You may have heard of ""leaves on a stream"" meditations, they are meant to teach you cognitive diffusion.

Here's an example...

Without cognitive diffusion:

Event: I have a test tomorrow I have not studied for.
Thought: I will probably fail and feel stupid. Being stupid means I'm worthless.
Feeling: The anticipation of shame and worthlessness makes me anxious which wears out my mind and body.
Behavior: I don't study, and fail the test.


With cognitive diffusion:

Event: I have a test tomorrow I have not studied for.
Thought: I notice I'm thinking about the worst possible outcome for tomorrow, and I'm having self-deprecating thoughts.
Feeling: I am having a feeling of anxiety.
Behavior: I'm sit up straight and take slow breaths when I need to, so my mind and body know I'm not actually in danger. I counter the self-deprecating thoughts as they arise with grounding/relaxation exercises to lessen the anxiety they cause. I'm still feeling shame anxiety, which sucks, but I'm still able to move forward because I know it won't last forever and it won't kill me. Once I have taken a few minutes to adress those thoughts and feelings, I can think a bit more clearly. I commit to learning one or two sections and pass with a D+. I take my anxiety to this situation as a sign that I value education and social acceptance, I also value perseverance which is why I studied anyway. I can chose to act on these values differently in the future, and I can see how useless self-deprecation was. Now my brain is a little less likely to reflexively self-depricate, and more likely to reflexively practice perseverance.

Obviously that's a very simplified example but that's the gist of it. In the second example, the person didn't identify with any of the thoughts or feelings, but they also didn't push them away or go into a panic. They experienced all of it at a distance and were able to make choices based on their values."

1589,YSK: E10 fuel pricing is often a scam,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: E10 fuel is typically overpriced per km.

TL;DR: Do not buy E10 fuel unless it is *at least* 4% cheaper than regular.

**What is E10 fuel?**

E10 fuel is petrol (gasoline) with 10% ethanol.

E10 fuel is not the problem. It works. Brazil has been using E20 and greater for many years thanks to its massive sugarcane industry.

Ethanol is a renewable fuel. So it makes sense to mix it with petrol to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

**The problem is pricing**

Ethanol has a lower energy content than petrol: around 21.1 MJ/L versus about 34.2 MJ/L (regardless of octane rating), or about 62% of that of petrol ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Fuel)).

Therefore, if a tank of petrol gets you 1000 km (for the sake of argument), a tank of 100% ethanol would get you only 620 km. Therefore, 100% ethanol would have to cost only 62% of 100% petrol to be price-competitive.

By these values, E10 has an energy content of about 32.9 MJ/L. This means that a tank of E10 will not get you as far as a tank of 100% petrol, and therefore should be priced accordingly. Specifically, 32.9/34.2 ≈ 0.96. Therefore, it should cost at least 4% less than 100% petrol to be an economic alternative.

Prices here in Australia at the moment are around 160¢/L for regular 91. Therefore, E10 should be less than 153.6¢/L. But it's around 158¢/L, or typically 2¢/L cheaper.

If a 60-L tank of regular 91 gets you the arbitrary 1000 km posed above, this will cost you 60 L × 160¢/L = $96/1000 km.

By contrast, a 60-L tank of E10 will get you 960 km and will cost you 60 L × 158¢/L = $94.80/960 km = $98.75/1000 km. At this price, it is more expensive per km travelled.

**Takeaway**

Look at the price of E10. If it is not at least 4% cheaper than regular, don't buy it: you'll get less mileage for your dollar."

1595,YSK that 1/4 inch sockets fit most hexagonal bits.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK - You can assemble things a lot faster and easier with a ratcheting socket wrench than you can with a manual screwdriver. If you have a bit set (which I highly recommend), you can figure out which bit fits best for the screw you’re using so you won’t strip the head (rendering the screw useless). Then you can use your socket wrench with 1/4” socket and Phillips or flathead bit to drive the screws. This is particularly handy when you have a lot of screws for whatever you’re assembling. Yes you can use an electric screwdriver or drill with that same bit, but they don’t always fit in certain spaces; socket wrenches are much more compact and easier to fit and manipulate in certain spaces (where sometimes you can’t even see and a typical screwdriver won’t fit). This can even be handy when trying to drill holes, especially if you don’t have a drill. I keep a 1/4” socket in my bit set. 

While I got you, I highly recommend splurging on a magnetic bowl. This fairly cheap purchase can save you from sending necessary hardware flying across the room when you accidentally kick or step on the bowl of nuts/bolts/screws/etc. That then saves you a trip to the hardware store for replacement parts, not to mention the overall frustration."

1604,"YSK ""Weak/Strong password"" checks are meaningless and have warped the average users perception of passwords and security.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Password security is extremely important and most people don't are completely unware because they are being lied to about their password strength.

Obviously a password with 8 characters is harder to crack than a password with 4 characters, that much is true. 

And common passwords like ""password"" are generally not allowed when creating accounts in most cases, which is also good.

But lets say you have a go-to password that is always considered ""strong"" on account creation pages. 

Those pages actually can't know if a password is strong, because if you have used it (or variations) elsewhere, it is no longer ""strong"".

&amp;#x200B;

The best way to combat this is with a password manager, the one that comes with your web browser is fine, but you can get free or paid services that allow for easier use on other devices.

Basically you click the ""create password"" button in the manager and then paste it into the password field when creating/editing an account.

This password will be a random assortment of numbers, letters and symbols that the manager will remember for you and autofill when you load a login page.

A nice side effect is it will make you less susceptible to phishing attempts because if autofill doesn't work right away then you know something might be wrong.

A lot of people are intimidated by the idea that they won't know their passwords anymore, I don't really care to get into it, but trust me, I've worked in IT support for long enough to know that you would be wrong to think that.

It can be beneficial and have very few side effects, but if you have too much by accident it can be very unpleasant, and even traumatizing. If you are of age and in a legal location, follow these instructions to make sure you have a good experience for your first time.

Get a package of 1:1 gummies. This means there is a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD. THC is the ingredient of concern here.

Let's say the container has 50mg of THC in it. If the container has 10 gummies, each gummy has 5mg of THC.

Cut one 5mg gummy into four equal pieces. Eat one of the pieces you cut. This is 1.25mg of THC. Think of it as ""a buck and a quarter.""

Wait 24 hours. If you felt nothing, that’s OK. Try eating two of the pieces (2.5mg THC) the next time. Eat three the next time (still waiting between tries for 24 hours) if you felt OK.

Repeat this until you hit a point where you feel relaxed and pleasant, but not uncomfortable. Don’t skip a step. Better to underdo it than to overdo it.

1653,YSK: Some cheeses have no lactose,YouShouldKnow,"
Why YSK: you might still be able to make dishes with cheese if you are lactose intolerant. A thorough or complete cheese has little or no lactose in it, so you don’t have to limit yourself necessarily. Milk is made up of two proteins; casein and whey. The whey is where the lactose is. When you make cheese, you separate the two proteins (thus you get curds and whey) using rennet (an enzyme that baby mammals naturally produce to digest milk) and keep the casein protein (that’s the cheese part). 

Some cheeses are less thorough with the rennet, like mozzarella, and have more whey. Those cheeses are less likely to be digestible for lactose intolerant people. Harder cheeses have less or no lactose because they are made with more rennet. If you are lactose intolerant, you might be able to handle these cheeses! Cheese on!"

**Why YSK:** If you never considered skipping your period forever because you didn't know it was possible, and you would like to do so, talking to your doctor about it and potentially starting on treatment if they say it is safe for you, could have you avoid decades of dealing with menstruation which is painful, expensive, and annoying.

1672,"YSK - On job boards, like indeed, even the “hidden” email shows a partial email and even crude ones are visible to employers. You should also know your resume can be reformatted and ruined, especially if you “built” it on their platform",YouShouldKnow,"
Why YSK: 

Indeed is especially guilty of this, not sure about all platforms, but you shouldn’t trust filters like that when you’re job hunting. 

The platforms will offer something like “indeed email” which is supposed to make your email private. What it *actually* does, is cut off a few digits/letters and the @_____.com
So if your email is something moronic or foul…it’s not playing in your favor on getting called my friend. 

Is it stupid if an employer takes that into account. Yup. Are they still likely to? Yup. Why? Because it makes you appear immature, and careless about appearing professionally, even if you’re an utmost professional in the workplace - they don’t know you yet and they’re relying on all those dumb details. 

I see like 20 resumes a week with partial emails that are better left to Reddit usernames or spam mail boxes…NOT your job hunt email. 

1. For your own sake folks - emails are free to establish. Get one for job hunting that doesn’t have an asinine screen name. 


2. If you built a resume on a job board site, read over it line by line, make sure it’s well written, because the format often gets ruined and the content needs to make it clear that you are competent. Punctuation matters too! 


3. And a side note here - STOP FILLING IN THE YEAR YOU GRADUATED. High school, college, any of it. See the Age Discrimination Act of 1967. It’s illegal for employers to even ask the year you graduated high school. Stop volunteering it, stop filling it out when these sites offer up the box to fill in. 


Not all tools available are going to help you as much as they claim.


These sites are there to make money, not help you specifically and they don’t care if you get a job or not - they care about making a monopolized resource that people blindly rely on."

1683,"YSK: food products that say ""organic"" on the box are often not fully organic",YouShouldKnow,"WHY YSK: I work in the advertising industry, and we parse literally every word on packaging and in commercials in order get as close to lying as possible. For example, if you see the word ""chocolatey"" in big letters on a box of candy, but *not* chocolate - there is no chocolate in the candy.

Right now ""being healthy"" and ""being green"" are buzz words in the food business.  Organic food is a big seller, but it's also expensive, and that cuts into the bottom line. So companies have started to advertise ""organic"" on their packaging when not all the ingredients are organic. If you see the phrase ""organic"" on a box of food, look closer - for example, on a frozen mushroom and sausage pizza, you may see something like:

^(made with) **ORGANIC** ^(mushrooms)

Everything else - the tomato sauce, the sausage, cheese, etc are made from ingredients that are *not* organic, and therefore most likely worse for you -- and often times worse for the planet. It's a neat way to trick you into buying something you don't want to buy. 

Read the packaging carefully. For a fully organic product, it can't say ""made with organic x"" it needs to say ""organic"" and *nothing else.*"
1684,YSK: About the Pittman-Roberston Act,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK. This is act is where all federal wildlife restoration funds come from. It has and will be the major contributor to preserving the environment for years to come. 70% of people using areas preserved by this act arnt hunting. Just by buying a hunting license even if you don't use it, you are helping to provide funding for conservation at a federal and state level.

How it works:

The act taxes all sales of handguns, ammo, and bows. This gets split up into 3 parts.

1.) Hunter education(8mil and shooting range improvements(1/2 of handgun taxes

 2.) Multistate conservation projects(3mil apply to prove need) 

 3.) State-based allotments. ( The remainder, 50% is based on land area and the other 50% is based on what percent of licensed hunters your state has out of national totals.) 

FYS 2019 had a total of  537,264,963 dollars from the hunting license percentage. There were also  15,375,694 licensed hunters, which means each license accounts for 35 dollars in wildlife restoration funds. 

For example in mass, a hunting license is 22.50 and requires no additional effort other than going online and purchasing. The purchases cost goes to the state for environmental protection and you help them get more funding from the federal government.

MLMs are a way to roleplay or LARP as a successful ""business owner""- not a path to actual success. They are predatory and a vast majority of people in them either lose money or make far less money than they would have with a minimum wage job.

1686,YSK: Walmart.com won't replace Great Value items under warranty,YouShouldKnow,"TLDR: They tell you to call the manufacturer and file a claim like it's 1990.

Why YSK: Warranty service is important for products that you will use for a long time.  Things like light bulbs usually last for years.  If they fail early, replacing them should be easy.  Amazon and other companies make it very easy to replace their own brand products that fail under warranty.  Walmart.com makes this difficult.  You can prevent future hassle by buying long-duty-cycle products from other companies, not from Walmart.com.

Here's my chat transcript from today:

Good news! Our agent \*\*\*\* has joined the conversation.

Me&gt; Hi \*\*\*\*. How are you doing?

Agent&gt; Hi \*\*\*\*! May I know how can I help you?

Agent&gt; I am fine \*\*\*\* thank you for asking, I hope you are doing well.

Me&gt; I bought four Great Value brand lights. One of the four bulbs has stopped working. The package says they last 22.8 years with 3-hours of use per day. That's 25,000 hours. I received them on March 11, which is 6000 hours ago. Can you help me to replace the failed bulb?

Agent&gt; I’m sorry to hear about what happened to your item. I completely understand where you are coming from right now. I am also a customer like you and I know how it feels having this kind of inconvenience. I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of this.

Agent&gt; And thank you for letting me know what happened it help to understand the whole situation. Allow me to review and see what the best resort I can do, kindly verify the email and phone number for security purposes?

Me&gt; \*\*\*\*@\*\*\*\* \*\*\*-\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*

Agent&gt; Thank you, kindly sit back and relax I’ll do the work here.

Agent&gt; Thank you for patiently waiting \*\*\*\*, upon checking here the replacement or refund is already not available. Don’t worry I check here if you can reach out to the manufacturer which is the Lenovo and here’s the contact number: 1-855-253-6686 option #1.

Agent&gt; I hope I was able to lessen your worries. May I know if  there’s anything else I can help you with today?

Me&gt; I was under the impression that Great Value was Walmart's brand and Walmart would handle warranty replacements.

Me&gt; I believe I could take the light into any Walmart store and they would replace it right away. Why doesn't Walmart.com offer the same service?

Agent&gt; I’m sorry for the confusion \*\*\*\*. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience that caused you. The item has a 1 year warranty so the manufacturer can process a replacement.

Agent&gt; I create a ticket escalation and send this to our Escalation and Validation Team to investigate what happened. I will make a full documentation to support your claim either refund or replacement.

Me&gt; Is there any way you could help me solve this?

Agent&gt; Kindly call the manufacturer \*\*\*\* they can help you to refund of replace the item. I’ll send an email to them to support your claim.

Agent&gt; I would really love to assist you with the replacement or refund but since the item is already out of return window, and no option available on my end.

Me&gt; Thank you. This is going to take me a long time to solve. Talking on the phone is usually a big waste of time. I will wait on hold. They will ask me to send them a receipt. Then it will take weeks for the replacement to arrive. It's not worthwhile for a $2 light bulb.

Me&gt; The company didn't give you the power to do warranty replacement for Walmart-brand products. It's not your fault.

Agent&gt; I really do apologized on this \*\*\*\*.

Me&gt; I feel disappointed. I thought Walmart.com would at least stand behind its products. That's why I bought Great Value brand instead of the other ones.

Agent&gt; I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns. I’ll make sure this feedback gets documented.

Me&gt; Thank you. Goodbye."

In many jurisdictions that attorney is paid by the city or county, but the city or county can then recoup that cost from the Defendant.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:  I learned this early in my legal career. My county did not have a public defender, but instead would assign criminal defense cases to all of the firms in the county on an as-needed basis. The attorneys, as a service to the community (and to stay on the good side of the judges), would take on the cases at a discounted rate. I, as the lowest ranking attorney in my firm, worked the criminal defense cases. One of my clients who got fully acquitted called me later asking why he received a bill from the county for my legal fees. I had no idea, so I inquired with the judge in charge of the pauper defense counsel program. He said that was how the program worked. The county was required to provide an attorney, but it does not have to be free. I was floored. They never taught us that in law school when we learned the Miranda rights. I always assumed ""if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you"" implied that it was free of charge."

This infection is caused by a microscopic, free-living ameba (single-celled living organism) called Acanthamoeba. Acanthamoebacauses Acanthamoeba keratitis when it infects the transparent outer covering of the eye called the cornea. Acanthamoeba amebas are very common in nature and can be found in bodies of water (for example, lakes and oceans), soil, and air.

Acanthamoeba keratitis is most common in people who wear contact lenses, but anyone can develop the infection. For people who wear contact lenses, certain practices can increase the risk of getting Acanthamoeba keratitis:

Storing and handling lenses improperly

Disinfecting lenses improperly (such as using tap water or homemade solutions to clean the lenses)

Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing lenses

Coming into contact with contaminated water

Having a history of trauma to the cornea

1696,YSK: Cisgender Males and Anyone on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) should be screened for Breast Cancer,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:
Cisgender males are at a reduced risk of breast cancer, but the numbers are still significant enough to justify screenings. 1 out of every 100 breast cancer diagnoses in the United States is a male (CDC, 2021.) At this time, a current hypothesis is that this number could be larger, but men have not been actively targeted or informed of their possibility of breast cancer risk. There is still a prevailing belief in many communities that cisgendered men cannot get breast cancer, which is absolutely not true. Get screened!

Individuals on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) should be screened early and often based on recommendations for their age, breast cancer history and use of HRT.

There are two main types of HRT: combination HRT which contains the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and estrogen-only HRT which contains only estrogen. Risk increases 75% for combination HRT users, regardless of amount of time used. Estrogen-only HRT increases risk, but only when used for more than 10 years (BreastCancer.org, 2021.)

Transgendered people on HRT can be at a particularly high risk, depending on several factors surrounding their own health disparities, and a lack of education regarding Transgendered health. There are several health services including hotlines, referral services and clinics in many states in the US who are trained in Transgender (and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, etc) healthcare. You can access resources here: 
https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/health-services.htm

The first step is prevention! Lifestyle changes, eating habits, stopping (or never starting) tobacco and nicotine products and lowering/eliminating alcohol use are all preventative factors. There are many more listed here:  https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-prevention-pdq

For the screening of breast cancer, people of all genders should perform a monthly manual breast self exam.

How to perform a breast self exam:

Check each breast one at a time.

Use your right hand fingers to check your left breast and your left hand fingers to check your right breast.

With your fingers flat against the breast, press firmly in small, clockwise circles.Start at the outermost top edge of your breast and spiral towards the nipple.

Feel for hard lumps or bumps in your breast and armpit lymph node areas. Be certain to cover all parts of your breast.

Gently squeeze both nipples and look for any discharge.

Look carefully for changes in the size, shape, and contour of each breast, e.g., puckering, dimpling, or changes in skin texture.
(www.idph.state.il.us, 2021)

If any lumps, bumps, discoloration, discharge, or any other changes are discovered upon completing a breast self exam, call your primary care doctor immediately to request a clinical breast exam.

If you are uninsured or under-insured, low income, or low socioeconomic status, you may be eligible for assistance in your state with the help of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). In combination with the CDC, they offer funding to individuals for Breast and Cervical Cancer screenings. To find a screening program near you, you can go to: https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/screenings.htm

Please be safe! Get screened!

1704,YSK: About this degenerate behavior being suppressed by elite and ruling classes.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Because what they are doing is detrimental to the health of our bodies and general welfare. It’s a behavior and conduct that they work hard to conceal and make unknown to the public. 

It’s a act of molestation that is performed ritually and involves constant and persistent stimulation of the penis gland and clitoris often of a child for an exceedingly amount of time. Usually for hours at a time without interruption or breaks in between. 

These people that conduct these acts are not pedophiles. They are not sexually attracted to their victims but is of some other nature. This degenerate behavior needs to be aware of and exposed. Then carefully studied. It’s an evil act against humanity and happens more often that you might think. 

I don’t know much about these degenerates and the behavior but I know what they do and are capable of. They have no boundaries to who and what they’ll do to someone. 

They often do it to babies that can’t speak or remember it happening to them and can’t speak out against them. They do this molestation practices to their victims until they have brain fluid and matter coming out of their nose.  Even then that doesn’t stop them. They will go through with it until they see fit. 

I’m not lying about this people, their victims are usually children or infants and are usually drugged during the practice if they’re lucky. 

It’s torture to have to go through this. Your body is not suppose to endure this kind of act. They go through this until brain fluid starts coming out the nose and other orifices. After that, brain matter and your body goes through something that is hard to describe because I’m not educated on the condition. 

Yes, I’ve had this done to myself. I can remember it being done to me as a infant, child and adult. I don’t know how but I shouldn’t be remembering it. Just writing it here my life could be in jeopardy.

Anyways I could go on and on about this but I don’t want to sound like nonsense. It’s a messed up practice that need to be made public so parents can be aware and protect their children from being victimized like I have and others I know. It happens more often than you think. 

The perpetrators can be anyone, male or female. What they do is detrimental to our mind and bodies. It’s cause havoc to one body and can even have long lasting effects to how your body develops. 

I just want you to know about this atrocity. These offenders are getting away with this and will continue to if something isn’t done about them. They weasel their way into places like schools, where children are and have embedded themselves into agencies like Department of Social Services and run CPS. They have nothing but bad intentions for everyone and I don’t know why. Why do they hate us so much?"

You don't have to offer your I.D. or identity unless you're driving a car, or they're **LEGALLY** detaining or arresting you (they can't legally detain you unless they have reasonable suspicion that you have committed or will commit a crime, **MAKE THEM TELL YOU WHAT THAT CRIME IS**.

1731,"YSK: In Germany, you can legally and for free protect your bank account from blocking by a claim organization, court, or creditor",YouShouldKnow,"**Why YSK:** Regardless if you are own alimony, you forgot to pay by credit card, or the German government did not receive a 10 EUR parking ticket payment because they lost the transaction in a jammed fax machine paper. For that, they can block your bank account with all your money through court, and you will not even be able to pay your creditor to unblock it. You would need to ask permission to pay from a different bank or ask your blocked bank to pay from your blocked account. All this procedure can be done by Post or fax (but only if the fax is outgoing from your number), or on rare occasions, you can use so-called ""**Electronic mail"" (**https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Email). This procedure could take from a week to a month.

To prevent this, anyone who owns a bank account in Germany has a legal right to convert ONE bank account to a protected account. Also known as ""Pfändungsschutzkonto"" or ""p-account."" Here is an example from one of the Banks:  https://support.n26.com/en-de/account-and-personal-details/ganrishment-insolvency-p-account/p-account-how-to-get. 

Remember, it's illegal to have more the one Protected account per person, even in different banks.

The way it works is if a court sized your account, the bank gives you a monthly allowance minimum of  1.252,64 EUR. And maximum allowance depends on your situation. This money can be used, for example, to pay rent or food or anything you like. No matter how much your current account has money or does not have at all.

Important. The fact of having a protected account will be reported to SCHUFA and may influence your credit score. However, if your account is blocked because of your debts, it by itself may affect your credit score.

Application to convert to a p-account is simple as one email or whatever your bank is required.

Disclaimer:

I'm not a lawyer and don't have any professional knowledge about this. I am just an average Joe who got his account sized because they couldn't find a 10 EUR  payment transaction. And because of that, I could not pay rent regardless of having enough money to cover a year of rent."

1742,YSK what an Order of Protection can do for you if you're experiencing domestic violence,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Orders of Protection are valuable tool for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to protect themselves. If you or someone you know is experiencing these issues, an Order of Protection can help you force law enforcement to be more helpful.

Hello r/YouShouldKnow! So first, some disclaimers: I am not a lawyer, but I work at a domestic violence shelter and have assisted many survivors in the completion of orders of protections, which we refer to as ex partes (you may also know them as restraining orders). And finally, OOP laws vary from state to state. Google what the laws are in your area if you want the most amount of information.

With those out of the way, lets talk about orders of protections (OOPs). OOPs are a legal order you able to pursue if you are or have experienced domestic violence or sexual assault. This isn't exclusive to intimate partners, and can cover roommates or family members as well. To fully understand how they work, I find it helpful to explain to clients what they can do, and what they can't: 

The most valuable thing a OOP can do, is let the police doing something when you call them for help. In many DV cases, police aren't helpful into a situation has escalated into full blown violence, because they may not have enough evidence of a crime for them to meaningfully do something about it. However, with an OOP, you are able (at least in my state) to order to them to stay a certain amount of feet away from you, thus if they come within that threshold they are in violation of the order and can be arrested. They also potentially have the power to reduce or eliminate the abusers ability to communicate with you, make them pay for rent, make them pay medical costs you received because of them, and return items or assets they may have (depending on the judge and your location). 

Another benefit of OOPs is that they are often an ex parte legal service. This means they can be granted, at least initially without the abusers testimony. That said, there will be a court date set where you and abuser will meet with a judge to discuss the order, but if you are in present danger it can provide some legal protection very quickly (I've seen OOPs granted within an hour or two of submission, though again it depends on the judge ) 

Now, some things an OOP can't do: OOPs are not criminal charge, so if one is granted it doesn't mean they will be arrested so long as they follow it. It also tends to not be able to cover custody, though most states have a separate child order of protection process you can go through (if you are a victim escaping DV, the biggest thing to be wary of is crossing state lines, as that could leave you open to parental kidnapping charges). 

How to get an OOP: It will vary depending on state or county, but in my location you can go to the county clerks office to file them. Many domestic violence shelters will have information on how to file them, or at least be able to refer you to places that can help, so definitely reach out to them to see if they can help.

\----

If anything in this post is unclear, or if you have any questions about OOPs or domestic violence situations in general, please reply and I will do my best to help."

Example: Some return items will be a shelf, a desk, a light fixture, etc. and the reason is the item didn't fit where they needed it to. However, they say the item is defective or doesn't work. So... it just didn't work for you? Or is there something really wrong with it?

It also breaks up the monotony of doing this job day after day. Hell, just say hi. Or be angry about it. I know nothing about you. Tell me how rough your life is going. Tell me you didn't approve the purchase, your bratty little kid did it. And if you're sending back diapers or pet items, please don't just put no longer needed. It makes me think the worst case scenario. I want to know if the baby got to big or the pet hates their bed. I don't need to know any of that, it's just for my peace of mind.

Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech.
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination.

Acting F.A.S.T. Is Key for Stroke

Acting F.A.S.T. can help stroke patients get the treatments they desperately need. The stroke treatments that work best are available only if the stroke is recognized and diagnosed within 3 hours of the first symptoms. Stroke patients may not be eligible for these if they don’t arrive at the hospital in time.

If you think someone may be having a stroke, act F.A.S.T. and do the following simple test:

F—Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?

A—Arms: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?

S—Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is the speech slurred or strange?

T—Time: If you see any of these signs, call 9-1-1 right away.

1791,YSK: Medical test results cannot be directly compared between labs,YouShouldKnow,"YSK: Medical test results cannot be directly compared between labs

Why YSK:
Patient access to their own test results is becoming mainstream. With this comes the risk of misinterpretation. I work in a hospital lab, here are some tips:

1. Reference ranges are normal ranges for a test.  However, they are specific to the lab producing the result. You can find published reference ranges online, however the labs ranges account for various factors and is more accurate. 

2. Labs have different ways of analyzing specific tests.  If two labs use different methods, it’s highly likely they will produce different numbers.  The results cannot be compared to each other directly.  Instead, compare each result to that labs reference range, come to a conclusion and then compare (ie high vs normal)

3. Even within a lab, error exists. Labs use quality control materials with expected values to control the performance of tests. However, these controls have acceptable ranges.  This means, day to day, test may run slightly high or slightly low and still be within acceptability. 

4. Reportable ranges are set based on clinical relevance. If your B12 level is higher than normal, it’s not clinically relevant.  Often times labs will not bother to extend their reportable range beyond this. You’ll end up seeing results like “&gt;1000” or “&lt;10” etc. 

5. Be wary of rabbit holing. If normal range for rheumatoid factor is &lt;10 IU/ml and you have results of 2, 5, and 8 over the past few months, there likely is still nothing to act on.  Normal is normal, don’t drive yourself crazy looking for trends. Labs have error and small trends like this are indistinguishable from that noise.

1820,YSK your city’s grid system and how to find an address without GPS,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Even though widespread use of navigation apps have rendered this knowledge somewhat obsolete, it will still make any delivery job much easier, and can come in handy if you ever find yourself lost with out access to a GPS. TL;DR at the bottom.

Have you ever wondered how addresses get their numbers? It’s not random, and most cities assign these numbers based on a logical grid system. 

Every grid has a geographical center where the numbers start at 1 and increase the farther you travel from the center. I live in Denver, Colorado so I’ll use it as an example. 

The grid center in Denver is the intersection of Broadway and Ellsworth Ave. If you look at the small numbers in the bottom right corner of the street signs they will both be “000”.  You can see an example of what numbers I’m talking about (for a different intersection) [here](https://imgur.com/a/mHZq8yu). 

Ellsworth is the dividing line between north and south, and Broadway is the dividing line between east and west. So since 12th Ave is 12 blocks north of Ellsworth it gets assigned 1200 N, and Cherokee St is 3 blocks west of Broadway so it get 300 W. These block numbers determine what the address will be on that part of the street. For example if you were looking for 1250 N Cherokee st, you would find it about halfway between 12th Ave and 13th Ave. Or if you were looking for 315 W 12th Ave it would be the first, second, or third building on 12th just west of Cherokee, depending on how many buildings are on that street. 

Furthermore 99% of the time addresses that are odd numbered will be on the north or west side of the street, depending on which way the road travels. While driving east/west, odd address will be on the north side of the street, while driving north/south they will be on the west side. Even numbered addresses will be on the south and east sides respectively. The only time this rule gets kinda wacky is if the street your on doesn’t travel in a pure cardinal direction, or curves from one direction to another. But even then you can still be certain that all the even numbers will be on one side and all the odd on the other. 

In Denver the grid extends into the outer suburbs, and I’d assume that true other places as well. All the way to the 18000 west block of Colfax blvd (Zeta st in Southeast Golden), the 33400 east block of Colfax all the way out in Watkins, as far north as Northglenn, and south into Parker. 

So as long as you know the address of your destination you should be able to find it by paying attention to the block numbers on the street signs. The letter before the number (N, S, E, W) will indicate which side of the city you’re on. Since the numbers only get bigger the further you travel from the center, if they are getting bigger as you are going along then you are traveling in the direction marked on the street sign, if they are getting smaller you’re going the opposite direction back towards the center. 

Of course it’s not 100% consistent. Downtown areas and suburban towns might have a different grid, and streets don’t always travel in a straight line or purely north/south or east/west. However knowing your grid can greatly help you get to where you’re going, with or without GPS. 

TL;DR: Address numbers are assigned according to a grid system. The further away from the center, the bigger the number. Odd numbers are usually on the north/west side of the street, evens on the south/east side."

There are 8 ""N11"" numbers you should know.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: There are 8 numbers established by the FCC to access special services. These numbers can provide you with essential services, are easy to remember, and all (but one) are free! These numbers, known as N11 codes, are:

**211—Community services and information**

211 services provide free and confidential services that help people across North America. Questions about human trafficking, disaster assistance, food, health, housing utilities, as well as jobs and support for veterans or some of the services offered. Often 211 services are operated by the United Way of America. 
 
**311—Municipal government services**

Many cities and towns in the US have deployed 311 services in an attempt to offload non-emergency requests from citizens. Under existing networks, these calls are sent to already over-burdened 911 centers. With 311 centers, residents can inquire about anything- from trash collection, to a municipal utility bill issue, to reporting non-active crime or other non-emergencies to the city/town government. 

**411— Reserved (directory assistance)**

Historically, 411 information services were often established to provide directory assistance or local information. However, their use has declined (because everyone has the internet now). Technically, the 411 number is reserved by the FCC and do not have a formal designation. Watch out though, most phone carriers charge for this service (usually $1-2 per call). This is the only N11 number that is NOT free.

**511—Traffic information**

511 has been established for road and weather information as the transportation and traffic information telephone hotline, and is typically administered by state or region. You can call this number to get information about traffic in your immediate area. 

**611— Reserved (Phone company repair)**

This is another one of those numbers that doesn't really have a formal use any more. In some areas, 611 was used as a test code for linemen on the street or was used to report troubles to the central office from a subscriber. Many phone and cable providers still use this number as a way for customers to report problems with their service or to make inquiries.

**711—TDD and Relay for the Deaf**

Every telephone company is required to connect persons who dial 711 to a Telephone Relay Service (TRS) from a device on a working number. This rule was extended to include all VoIP telephones in July 2007 by the FCC. 


**811—Underground public utility location**

In March of 2005, the FCC established 811 as the universal number that would coordinate location services for underground public utilities. This safety measure not only helps prevents damage that interrupts telecommunications, but also the cutting of subterranean power lines, water mains and natural gas pipes. Call before you dig!

**911—Emergency services (police, fire, EMS)**

The one we all know! Single-number access for all emergency services, including police, fire and medical.

In addition to these numbers, **988** is currently in the process of being adopted as the number for the **National Suicide Prevention Hotline**. The change will fully go into effect on July 16, 2022."

There are two witnesses who claim that Rosenbaum attacked Rittenhouse and he had reason to fear for his life. But there are a few problems:

Rosenbaum was unarmed and didnt hurt anyone that night. One of the witnesses is a journalist for the far right publication The Daily Caller. And the other is someone who was there “patrolling” with Rittenhouse that night.

1848,YSK Never buy a house from flippers!!!,YouShouldKnow,"&amp;#x200B;

Why YSK: If you reach the phase in your life of buying a house, who were the previous owners matters a lot. Your top priority are houses that the owner lived in them. Owners usually take care of their houses, and invest a lot of money in quality repair (although there is also the risk that the person was a DIY type and the fixing was amateurish). Your intermediate priority is to buy from a house that was rented to other people. Renters don't take care of the house they live in. The age of the people who lived in the house also matters (if you can get this information), as college students will be more destructive than old people. Finally, whatever you do don't buy a house from flippers. These are people that buy rickety houses, fix them, and sell them for maximum profit. They know that the average customer is clueless in house repair, and their fixing is usually cosmetic. You'll get a house with many problems.

Bonus tip: When you go to an open house, the owners usually hire a furniture staging company. The staging is not random. Carpets might be placed to hide messed up floor boards, and furniture could be used to hide damaged walls. Look behind and underneath the furniture when evaluating a house."

1852,YSK how to increase your chances of survival in a crowd crush,YouShouldKnow," Why YSK: The recent tragedy at the Travis Scott music festival event isn't a one-off and you could find yourself in a similar situation.

As someone who has been in a crowd crush, I can assure you it's horrifying, and it shouldn't happen if the crowd has been organized correctly.

Even in cases when it's not lethal, serious injury occurs, and it can be traumatizing. You should know there are things you can do to protect yourself if you find yourself in a crowd crush.

* **Know the signs.** It's important that you can recognize when a crowd is progressing towards a crush. The most obvious way to recognize this is if you can't lift your hands up high enough to touch your face. This means the amount of people per square meter has gone past a safe level. Before things get dangerous, if the crowd moves slightly and you move with it against your will, it's time to begin finding a way out because if a bigger, stronger push comes, you will be taken with it. What are people around you saying? Take notice of other people's energy. Are they panicked? Are they uncomfortable? Are they saying things that echo your own anxiety around what could be a developing danger? The best time to notice these red flags is just before the show starts, because in all likelihood once it's started, those movements will be much harder to fight against, and it is going to be loud. So stay vigilant to this leading up to the start of a show.
* **Locate exits.** Once you know things are getting hairy, scan the area for your best exit options and begin moving to the closest. Is it the barrier at the front of the crowd? Or is it behind you where the crowd is less compressed? You need to have your bearings or you could find yourself moving deeper into crowd. How many rows of people are there between you and the exit? Take a mental note. Before the show starts, you need to know which direction to head in if things become dangerous.
* **Protect your chest.** The main cause of death in a crowd crush is suffocation. This is caused by surrounding bodies compressing your chest so no oxygen can flow. Get your arms up to your chest like your a boxer, and use them to keep people off you to your best ability. Maintain the guard and apply force with your arms to keep people at bay, and give yourself breathing room. Videos from Astroworld show a lot of people with their arms at their side. They likely didn't know about this strategy.
* **Keep upright/move with the crowd.** Another major cause of death in crowd crush is trampling. Staying on your feet is easier said than done, especially if there is a collapse near you. If you've ever experienced a dense crowd, you know that the waves are strong. No matter how good and sturdy your footing is, you aren't going to be able to fight against the weight. The best way to avoid falling over is to move with the flow of the crowd. The moment you feel the wave coming, allow yourself to move in its direction and focus on staying up. Continue in the direction of your best exit between waves.
* **Stay calm.** It takes a long time to get out, you need to keep a level head so you can focus on protecting your chest, staying upright, and getting to the exit. If you begin to panic, you'll also start beathing faster. In a situation where suffocation is the main cause of death, staying calm will regulate your breathing and preserve your most important resource.
* **Help others.** Finally, your own survival is obviously critical but that doesn't mean looking out for number one at all cost. In fact, the opposite is true. Working together is the best way to avoid mass death in crowd crush. Helping people (when you can) get off the ground, or making sure people don't fall will actually increase your chances of getting out faster, and if you fell you'd definitely want someone to help you.

1858,YSK that quickly comparing health insurance plan costs during open enrollment (now!) can save you thousands in health insurance costs next year [USA],YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Many people stick with the health insurance plan they've had for years, but annual changes in premiums and out-of-pocket costs can have big impacts on your actual and potential expenses. By using a spreadsheet to compare overall costs, you can choose the most cost-effective plan that your employer offers. Sometimes that choice even bucks conventional wisdom like ""HSAs are only for young, healthy, single people"" and ""Definitely choose the most expensive plan if you are going to have a baby."" The right choice is specific to the plans offered by your employer!

In  the US, the Open Enrollment period at the beginning of November is the only time during the year you can make changes to your health insurance  plan (barring certain life events). Many companies offer several plans  with different cost structures, and doing a thorough comparison can save  you more money than you would think. Many times, the most expensive plan is NOT the best choice, even if you know you will have a lot of  medical costs.

Here is a spreadsheet template you can save a copy of. Fill in the outlined section at the top with the various plans offered by your/your spouse's  employer: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18kLItQPl3DVFN4TnKJrA4ZUurWirj5IP1hooipTiY7g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18kLItQPl3DVFN4TnKJrA4ZUurWirj5IP1hooipTiY7g/edit?usp=sharing)

Look  at your company's offerings to find the monthly premium, deductible,  coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum. If your company offers a  High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and has an HSA (health savings  account) contribution they add, include that, too.

Once you've replaced my sample numbers with your own, look at the graph to  see how much you will pay in total (premiums, deductible, total  out-of-pocket costs) to choose the right plan for you or your family.

I  often see posts on Reddit that HSA plans can be very cost-effective for young, single people who don't have many medical expenses.  Additionally, many assume that if they know they will incur large costs  (e.g. major surgery, having a baby) during the year, then they should choose the most expensive plan that covers the most. *In many cases, that is not true!*  High-deductible health plans often have such low premiums that they  come out less expensive overall than traditional ""gold/platinum"" PPO  plans, even if you incur tens of thousands of dollars in medical  expenses."

There may be differences between certain models etc, but simply put: if you look in your settings for wherever your phone's sound controls are there should be a plethora of options to change the sound coming out from its speakers aswell as the headphones. 

For me personally I've got an older Samsung android phone and these settings are listed under 'advanced sound settings'. I've found the best settings are: custom equalizer with all frequencies cranked right up, adapt sound at 60 or over and finally Dolby atmos at 'auto'. I'm no sound engineer so it's possible these settings could be blasting my ears out right now, but trust me when I say it's made my music a million times better, especially if you've got cheaper model headphones! 

So fiddle with some sound settings people and lemme know if it's made your music better! Maybe my headphones are just rubish to begin with lol"

1879,"YSK: that in crush/ crowd asphyxiation deaths, multiple factors often come into play besides crushing chest injury, including things like carbon dioxide exchange from exhalation, and air flow, making petite women and children especially vulnerable.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: this could save the life of smaller people in a mass crush/crowding event. 

In overcrowded, pressing situations, petite women and children may be at risk before anyone notices anything is wrong, even in relatively tame crowds. Watch for signs and fainting, and if things start moving very fast, start moving them to the edges of the crowd earlier rather than later. If you *are* a petite person, this is not the time for pride; you might be a badass, but you can't generate your own oxygen.

Also, not being in this catagory is *by no means* any insurance, as multiple factors are involved, and none of it matters if you get trampled to death or crushed against a barricade, anyway. It just means the threshold for danger may be deceptively low for shorter folks - literally."

1890,YSK: Travis Scott was likely told to keep performing and that if he abruptly ended the show it would of potentially led to more casualties.,YouShouldKnow," Why YSK: I've seen a lot of people today unfairly blaming Travis Scott for the deaths that occurred at Astro World but it's a meritless accusation.

* **Human crushes happen when a critical density of people is reached** and causes the crowd to behave according to fluid dynamics, **this will always happen at a certain density without safeguards** like railing separating the crowd into pockets.
* This problem was **exacerbated because the venue was understaffed and crowds were able to sneak in**, likely putting the venue over capacity.
* If you've ever been onstage you will also be familiar with how **stage lights obscure your view of the crowd**, so for a portion of the show Travis was likely unaware what was happening.
* After finding out the situation, **Travis was likely told to keep performing** because **abruptly stopping would of sent waves of people to the exits inflaming the delicate situation** and likely would of led to more casualties.
* This one of the reasons buildings have capacity limits
* This is not the first time it's happened, and will definitely not be the last, it's **always a danger when crowds form**

Blaming a performer for this isn't right, this night must have been extremely tough for him too, and it's something that could potentially haunt him. I hope you all can keep this in mind. I also hope that this will be used as lesson to prevent this from happening again in the future.

At the end of the day it's an extremely tragic situation, my heart goes out to the victims, I hope they rest in peace, and I hope their friends &amp; family can find peace.

For life we want a guy who is genuinely nice and treats the people who he is supposedly  \`superior´ to with compassion and respect. Animals, children, old people. These are the things that truly show ones heart. These are the guys we want to be with for the rest of our life. These are the girls who will be on your side. Who do not give a damn if you go to the gym, and if you do, they will encourage you, and support your hobbies and passions no matter what it may be. Who could care about a belly, or a job that isn’t as successful as you wish you would be? It all comes down to a lionheart and sharing at least some of the same interests. And lifting up your spirit, as much as you lift up her spirit. If you want to hold hand with a woman when you are old and grey just make sure you are not a condescending a-hole, but rather a compassionate, empathetic good guy."

1966,"YSK how to clean your genitals properly (male or female) and that it is important in order to prevent a variety of issues, smells, and imbalances of bacteria or ph, but that doesn't necessarily mean scrub everything with soap, and for the love of Pete, keep that soap and water out of the vagina!",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Both male and female genitals have areas that need to be cleaned and areas that need to be left largely alone. Not cleaning can cause issues, infections, and smelly buildups. Cleaning too much, or in areas best left alone, can also cause issues and infections, and a bunch of other problems besides. Plus, your sexual partners will thank you for the proper care and hygiene. 

Men: 
If you're circumcised; wash your penis and testicles gently with a mild soap. Stay out of the urethra, especially with soap. Make sure you get into any skin folds where yeast and bacteria can build up. Please wash your balls, especially if you have anyone who hangs out down there sometimes. They get smelly, even if you don't notice. Generally though, you have the ""ez clean"" version of genitals. 

If you're intact: same as above (and wash your balls!), only be sure to gently retract your foreskin and clean under and behind the ridge along your glans/head of penis. If you're through puberty and retracting your foreskin is difficult or painful, see a doctor about it, but keep trying to gently retract the foreskin and to clean out any buildup behind. Gentle retraction will usually eventually help loosen the foreskin and allow you to clean behind the glans.

If you're not through puberty, then you can try and start gently retracting your foreskin, but do not force it (and don't let any adults/doctors forcibly retract it either!). As you progress through puberty, hormonal changes will slowly separate the foreskin from the glans of your penis. Forcibly retracting your foreskin can cause tears on the glans and in the skin. Until the foreskin and the glans have separated, buildup and bacteria can not get in behind (at least not to the same degree as they can after puberty). Cleaning gently with soap while trying to gently retract your foreskin as much as you comfortably can will allow you to clean it well enough while also gently stretching the foreskin.

Phimosis (the inability to fully retract the foreskin) is a thing that happens more than guys might realize and can lead to issues like a buildup of smegma under the foreskin and behind the glans, which can smell really bad. Or infections, such as balanitis (yep, that's the actual name) that can cause pain, swelling and discharge. Phimosis is common and easily treated, usually with a topical cream prescribed by your doctor, rarely with a minor surgical procedure, even more rarely with circumcision. 




Women:
First a bit about terminology: the vagina is *only* the part that is internal (the ""baby hole"" if you like). Up inside the vagina is the hymen (which isn't always there, isn't always closed, and comes in a wide variety of totally normal shapes and styles), and the cervix, beyond the cervix is the uterus. LEAVE IT ALL ALONE!! Your vagina is self-cleaning and does not need any help at all. Don't douche, don't put soap up there ever, don't wash it out with water even. It's good all on it's own. If you're noticing a smell or you have unusual discharge, see a doctor. However, SOME DISCHARGE IS TOTALLY 100% NORMAL!!! It's also normal to have slightly different discharge at times based on your hormones.

 As I said, vaginas are self-cleaning, which means they make mucus, that mucus picks up dead skin cells, dirt and any *ahem* ""random debris"" and flushes it out. Kind of like your nose actually, only way more acidic. Your vagina needs to be acidic, that keeps it healthy and keeps infection and random bacterial visitors at bay. Soap, and even plain water, can mess up the acidity and Ph balance. It needs to be acidic. It also means your mild discharge can sometimes bleach your super hot black panties. Yes, it's annoying. It's also normal. Leave the vajayjay alone.

The ""outer bits"" are collectively referred to as ""the vulva"". No, your clitoris is not in your vagina. No, your underwear does not (usually...) bunch up in your vagina. No, you definitely do not have your vagina pierced! That whole bit you (or your special friend) can see without special equipment called a speculum? All vulva. That all needs to be washed gently with a very mild soap. The inner and outer labia, the clitoral hood, the perineum even; all the outer bits need the occasional gentle wash with gentle soap. Don't start madly pulling your clitoral hood back and getting in there with the soap (ouch) and stay out of the vaginal opening and urethral opening entirely, but give the vulva a gentle once over with some mild soap, inside and out, skin folds and all. 

A minor note on vaginal openings: sometimes (most commonly in pre-puberty, the vaginal opening can form a covering of skin that completely seals the vaginal opening. This is not the hymen. It forms on the outside of the vaginal opening. It is generally caused by lower levels of estrogen. It usually will resolve itself before or during puberty, but can occasionally persist and will require treatment to allow menstrual fluid to pass. Some doctors prefer to treat it as soon as it is noticed (usually when a child is very young) with a hormonal cream. Other doctors prefer to leave it alone entirely in the hopes that it resolves itself. If it is still present when the menstrual cycle starts, it will need to be treated. 


Lastly, whatever your gender, wash your butthole and butt crack please. With soap. No penetration needed, just give that chocolate starfish a soapy bath."
1967,"YSK that if you drive a push-to-start vehicle, pressing the start button WITHOUT your foot on the brake pedal will put your vehicle into accessories or run without starting the engine.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:

I work in automotive service and lately many customers have been choosing to stay in their vehicle. This is becomes an issue when theyve rolled up their windows and when we need to communicate with them they will often start their vehicle unnecessarily to roll down the window. Many will even argue afterward that they cannot roll the windows down without the car running.

IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO START YOUR VEHICLE WHILE A TECHNICIAN IS WORKING ON IT (and potentially the vehicle as well depending on the service being performed.) 

Your start button will put your vehicle into accessories by pressing it once (twice in some cases) or on some vehicles by pressing and holding the start button for a few seconds. So long as you don't have your foot on the brake pedal, your vehicle will never start the engine during this process"

1971,YSK Very often Technical Schools that offer a welding program typically offer an accelerated program that can finish in just a few weeks. If you need a decent paying job in relatively short time frame this is a great path.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Welders are in demand all over the country. Starting wages can vary by quite a bit but if you find yourself in a financial and/or career pinch this path could help.

Many people are scared away from a path like this because they didnt grow up with it and they have zero experience but I want to stress that these technical programs are designed to teach someone from the ground level. You can enter completely ignorant and leave completely qualified."

1973,YSK how to use a password manager,YouShouldKnow,"These days password managers are the best option for you, in terms of practicality and also safety of course.

You signup for a new website? Credentials can automatically be saved and you can generate individual, strong, passwords for your accounts. And managers like Bitwarden even offer stuff like auto-fill (with fingerprint/facial authentication etc) which is really convenient. All your accounts are in one place.

Why YSK:  
1 - It's not safe to use browsers' password storage because if you leave your device unlocked anyone can access your accounts because there is no further validation, just the click of a button.

2 - For chrome especially, since it's owned by google, you might (and should) not feel safe with their privacy policies so there's that.

Please update yourself, and be safe, you can't even imagine the damage stolen credentials can make. Even if you think ""I have nothing to hide""."

1978,YSK The word sentient does not mean self-awareness or consciousness it actually describes an awareness of sensation.,YouShouldKnow,"The term sentience is used incorrectly almost ubiquitously in popular media. In TV, film, books and video games it is usually used to describe a being as being self-aware.

i.e. A self-aware A.I is often described as being ""sentient.""

However the correct usage of the word describes a being that is capable of perceiving sensation. For instance insects, fish and lizards are all sentient but are not sapient.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience)

The correct word to use is actually sapient. As in ""homo sapiens"" or ""The A.I has become self-aware, it is sapient""

**Why YSK:** While the evolution of language is an organic process and should be allowed to grow as such, words hold meaning and some are more specific than others and so being clear on those meanings is important to help understanding.

It may seem pedantic to quibble about the distinction between sentient and sapient but they both describe different and equally important aspects of experience and should be used and discussed as such."

1988,YSK: Asking someone why they're so quiet is not helpful,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Ever had a quiet classmate, family member, or coworker? Who doesn't talk to you? And they hang around, watching everyone talk, but not inputting anything themselves? And sometimes, you just want to know what's going on inside their head? So you ask them, ""why are you so quiet?"" While you may just want to help them feel more at ease, it actually makes them more nervous.

I can't even tell you how many times I've gotten that question before. And I still have no idea how to answer it. I know that nine times out of ten, when someone asks that, they're not trying to embarrass you, they're just trying to help. But when I was younger, I perceived it as the person asking thought I was weird. A lot of introverts I know take that question personally. It's just an awkward question to answer. I mean, being quiet is a personality trait, just like how been talkative is a personality trait. Do we go up to extroverts and ask them why they're so talkative? No. Because that's just them. It's only because society conditions people to believe that being introverted is bad.

So to my extroverts out there, I like your initiative. I like how you're trying to help make introverts more comfortable, but that's just not the way to go about it. Perhaps ask them little questions, such as their hobbies or their favorite TV shows"

1997,YSK that health and wealth disparities among African Americans are rooted in the historical practice of redlining.,YouShouldKnow," [Housing Segregation and Redlining in America](https://youtu.be/O5FBJyqfoLM)

Why YSK: Home ownership is the number one way that Americans build generation wealth; people of color (especially African Americans) have been systemically deprived of the tools necessary for quality home ownership since the 1930s. The practice of redlining has contributed to the health and wealth disparities that are so prevalent today. This video can improve your understanding of racial inequity in America.

From this visualization, make contingency plans should something not go according to your visualized plan. This way you can create back ups or change plans accordingly before the fact instead of at the last minute.

Why YSK: Visualization is a great tool when planning things for many reasons including avoiding errors, better overall planning, making contingencies, building confidence, being assertive, making sure not to forget things, etc.

2003,"YSK Every service worker (Bartender, Delivery Driver, Server) IS making at-least federal minimum wage. No matter how much tips they get!",YouShouldKnow,"Barring illegal wage theft, of course.

Why YSK: I hear all over the place how it's such a tragedy that tipped workers don't even earn minimum wage. But it's not true. You should know if a 'tipped' worker didn't receive enough tips to average out to at-least minimum wage, it's federal law that the employer must pay the employee enough money to average out to at-least minimum wage.

For example: pretend a server got no tips during a 10 hour shift. Come end of week, Boss/owner must pay the server enough money for them to have made at-least $7.25 for every hour worked. ($72.50)

Really tired of hearing about how people 'rely on tips' as a reason to change the system. No. They're getting minimum wage no matter what (unless illegal activity). Your fat tip isn't necessary, but it sure encourages superb service.

Did you know that you are made up of literally TRILLIONS of cells? All cells are living things but it just so happened that you were born a human, the most intelligent and powerful being that may have ever existed. You could so easily have been born a cell rather than a human. Or you could’ve been a fly, or a cow, or any other non self aware organism. It is quite amazing that you are here, with the free will to do anything you want, whenever you want.  

The fact that your consciousness randomly emerged at this point in time, which placed you in this body where you are today is hard to grasp, to say the least. But it really is incredible. The universe is unfathomably big and apparently the odds of intelligent life forming are insanely slim; requiring the perfect set of events to take place over the span of billions of years. We really could be the only intelligent life out there which just makes it even more amazing that you are here to witness it. You are so so lucky. 

Not only are you here to witness it, you are also here at the peak of opportunity, with so many advances in technology and knowledge. We have no idea what the future will bring so try and embrace every moment you have and think of what it actually means to be here at this time. 

Stop worrying about the little things in life. You have won the biggest lottery of them all, so try to think positively about every situation you’re in :)

This also works well with those ""spin the wheel for discounts"" after entering your email websites. Just find the best promo code on the wheel and use it at checkout without spinning. 

You can also use the same promo codes but just change the number for a bigger discount. So if the promo code works as ""20OFF"", you should try ""30OFF"" and if it works, keep going until it doesn't.

These promo codes are often never deactivated just because they are forgotten about, so it can be useful to try ones like ""SUMMER21"" even in the fall or winter.

You can also try to get creative with the websites that may have promo codes as tests. In high school, I randomly put ""PIZZA"" in the promo code bar when ordering from a popular chain near me, and got 50% off my order."

2039,YSK Caffeine might be making your life harder,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: We tend to forget that caffeine is a psychoactive drug. 





Just like anything in life, there’s always a good side and a bad side. However, the problem is that when using drugs such as caffeine, that have the ability to affect the brain on a daily basis. We mess up our natural brain functions.

We reach a level of dependence that legitimately makes us forget how we used to operate naturally before we abused them.



One of the worst side effects is sleep problems and that’s what I’m going to focus on in this post. 

To understand how caffeine makes us alert we need to understand how it affects adenosine.

Adenosine is a powerful type of molecule in our bodies and the build up of adenosine causes drowsiness which makes us sleep at night. 

Caffeine on the other hand is a stimulant and it works by inhibiting adenosine receptors which helps keep us alert. 



We should keep in mind that a lot of food and drinks contain caffeine. For example, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks such as coke, chocolate, energy drinks etc…

Moderation is key. Start by decreasing caffeine intake to a point where you can function normally without it. Then, consume it only when necessary. 
You’ll be shocked when you realize that you can live without using it daily : )

Oh and absolutely no caffeine at least 6 hours before bed!!!! 

Best of luck &lt;3

2040,YSK: most colleges and universities in the US do NOT require a high-school diploma for graduation,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: if you are academically inclined and currently in high-school, but not enjoying it, the school, which has a vested interest in keeping you around because you bring up the average, will mislead you or outright lie to you, that if you don’t graduate, you won’t go to college, your life will be ruined, and you will die in a gutter.  If you believe them, you will waste a year or two of your life doing things that don’t interest you and don’t help you.

Universities are businesses.  They would rather have a good student at their school, paying their tuition, improving their reputation, than somewhere else.  If you are a successful high-school junior, they are more than happy to consider you for admission a year early.  You don’t have to be Dougie Howser, you just have to show up.

(For people who have already left high-school, the situation may be similar — or not, I don’t know.)

I dropped out.  By the time I was 17, I was a sophomore in a highly regarded college, an apartment, a motorcycle, a job (doing top-secret defense work), a girlfriend, and was generally living my best life.  People I had entered high school with where still living in their parents house, taking the bus to that high school, studying bullshit, *asking permission to take a leak*."

2042,YSK women don't view being stared down as a compliment,YouShouldKnow,"This is not the typical woman vs men post. It's come to my attention many think it's a compliment or one should be flattered.
Listen I get it, you're super hungry you see some amazing food, you stare at it. On a hike, you see a dope view, you stare at it.
As humans we can't stop being visually mesmerized by the things we find attractive.

Why YSK This? 
However, humans aren't views. I would expect that people would have a deeper understanding that having a total stranger bore holes through your skull with their eyes is unsettling at best and straight up creepfest at worst. You might be thinking ""oh I want her to know I think she's attractive"" but really she's probably thinking ""why won't this guy stop staring at me? Should I leave and go somewhere I'm safer?"" .
If you're trying to impress her, trust me, IT'S NOT WORKING, 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO INSTEAD ? 
if you then stand up to talk to her she'll be less inclined to indulge you than if you just went up to her in the beginning without the stare DOWN. Her impression of you won't be tainted by the thoughts she might have been having while you creeped her out &amp; you might have higher chance of success! :) 

Caveat : If she visibly is interested in you and you two are exchanging flirtatious glances that's a different story all together."

2046,YSK that paying off a bill that’s already in collections doesn’t remove it from your credit score,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: many people believe paying off a collection that’s harming your credit clears the debt, so therefore it should logically clear off the bad mark against your credit score too. This is not the case. Whether or not you pay it, once something is in collections it will stay on your credit for 7 years. You can request the collection agency drop it now that it’s paid, but them agreeing to do that is pretty rare, especially when your only bargaining chip (paying the collection) has already been given up. 

So honestly, as shitty as it may be, once it gets to that point it makes more sense just to wait out the 7 years of delinquency and not to bother wasting the money paying it off."
2047,"YSK If you are a male, you should ejaculate several times a week to keep your prostate healthy, this is why no nut November is not a good idea",YouShouldKnow,

2049,"YSK, American Football, and all other sports generally referred to as ""Football"" are NOT named that way because of the body part primarily involved.",YouShouldKnow," 

Why YSK, I regularly see Europeans and other ""traditional"" football fans mock American Football(Hand egg to many of those people), because of the name and the minimal use of foot contact with the ball. People regularly seem to think that that is the reason why football, or soccer in some countries, is named that way. However, the real reason is that back in the day when horseback riding was significantly more common, sports were differentiated by being on foot or on horse. Whichever sport ended up being most popular in any given country, ended up being referred to simply as ""Football"". Hence, even a sport like rugby, which also has minimal kicking, is technically, ""Rugby Football""."

You can still cum but this will have no sperm in it. You have to wear a condom for the first two weeks though as some sperm may be present.

2060,YSK about some online legit graduate programs from accredited universities,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Graduate education is fucking expensive, and since is a big commitment in more ways than one, so this is a great alternative. It helps that masters degrees obtained online have gained a lot more respect since last year.

Here's a few that have caught my eye:

[GATech MS CS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) (#38 worldwide in computer science, QS) - $8,000 in total

Georgia Tech offers degrees in analytics and cybersecurity too at under $10,000.

[UT Austin MS CS](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/msonline) (#28 worldwide in computer science, QS) - $10,000 in total

UTA offers a MS Data Science degree for the same price too.

[Arizona State MS Supply Chain Management](https://www.edx.org/masters/online-master-in-supply-chain-management-asux) - $18,000

[Imperial College London MPH](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/global-mph-imperial/) - £13,000 across two years (only for students in the UK though)

[KU Leuven, Belgium MS Statistics](https://www.onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50550147.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving) (#24 worldwide in statistics, QS) - €1,250 each year

[SRH Berlin MA Photography](https://www.srh-berlin.de/en/master/photography-berlin/) - €800/month for 1.5 years

To my knowledge, all of these should result in a degree that's the same as the one you'd get, if you studied on campus.

These are just ones that've caught my eye, and I'm sure there's many others I'm missing (you could link them in the comments!)"

I do it with two old iPhones and an iPad I don’t use much and keep them on 24/7.

1) Create a 2x1 table,

2) Copy my plot in the first row,

3) Include my caption in the bottom row,

4) Make the table borders invisible, and Tada!, you've got a beautiful plot, with a caption, which can be easily manipulated around the page!

It's also scalable. You can create an adjacent column to have legends and arrows pointing to elements in the picture, or even have 2 graphs with 2 distinct captions along the same row."

In rare cases, adult family members have spread this story in an effort to cover up murder or accidental deaths. In other incidents, a child who has been told about poisoned candy places a dangerous object or substance in a pile of candy and pretends that it was the work of a stranger. This behavior is called the copycat effect.

Of course, always take caution and inspect but know that it is not as big of a threat as media might make it each year.

To my fellow vapers who made the poor decision to pick up a nicotine addiction, yes, It can and will damage your PC if it gets near it.

I noticed a weird sound coming from my pc, given it's been almost a year since I've cleaned the thing, I decided it was time to do so and that it might be the cause of the issue.

I noticed a weird sticky substance around my CPU and GPU fans. At first I thought It was just because I haven't cleaned it in so long. So I used a Q-tip and wiped it off a bit, or at least tried. It was stubborn. I later looked at it wondering what it was, and I smelled it. Smelled like pineapple. My favorite flavor at the time (haven't touched a vape in three months :))

Not only can it build up like what happened to me, but with research I found that many of the common ingredients in E-liquid are conductive, would could cause permanent damage.

I never smoked and I'm just a teenager who made stupid decisions, but in stressful times I was going through 3 packs of cigs worth of nicotine in a day. Majority of those days was spent at my computer doing my online classes. my friend came over one day and she said my whole room smelled like the pineapple vape i was using. she's used mine before and could instantly detect the smell, that's how much i was using it. I cant imagine have badly it could be for someone who used/uses for a much longer time on their computer.

This also applies to cigarettes, smoking and vaping THC.

Side note 1: Nicotine isn't cool and just because you discovered a gas station that doesn't check ID's isn't an excuse to keep vaping and kick the habit, I was getting cheap fake disposables before from sketchy ppl and made the excuse of ""i can keep doing it since it is legit and won't hurt me as much and I'm safer from these people"". I don't have the luxury of an older sibling like most of my friends, and when I discovered this gas station my usage went through the roof, and i made the mistake of telling people and now some friends beg me to go over there for them, especially girls because they don't want to meet up with people. Not needing to pump nicotine in your system at least every few hours is nice, healthier, cheaper, less worrying, and if you're like me you don't have to worry about parents or getting pulled over. notice how this side note is almost as long as the post? Because the whole post wouldn't be needed if people didn't struggle like me.

TLDR : Don't vape near your pc in an enclosed space, will build up and can cause issues."

What is actually left is bones, they grind those bones into a powder and that is what you get when you are given ""Ashes"". Its a lot nicer to say here are the ashes as opposed to here are the pulverized bones of your former family member or pet.

Bone Dust is very bad for all water life and the majority of things that injest it die from it.

Never scatter ashes in a river, or a lake, hell if you want to do it in the ocean, you have to be a minimum of 3 nautical miles deep and even then they would rather you didn't, because you will still kill stuff.

TL:DR you don't ever get ""ashes"" you get ground up bone dust that does not dissolve in water and kills lots of the things that end up eating it."

2145,"YSK: Your hard drive/SSD can predict when it's going to fail, and it's easy to check this data",YouShouldKnow," 

Why YSK: It’s simple and helps you avoid hard drive failure.

Storage devices predict when they will fail with a technology called SMART. For hard drives, it predicts 75% of all failures.

Back in the Windows 7 era, computers would tell you when SMART predicted a failure. The computer would say a SMART failure is predicted when booting up, Windows 7 would give you errors every few minutes saying your hard drive is going to fail, and you couldn’t even install Windows 7 onto a failing drive unless you turned off the SMART check.

But, for some reason, windows 10 has none of that. My hard drive was predicting a failure for 6 months before I caught it, because I was testing a diagnostic utility.

So, if you want to check, Download CrystalDiskInfo. It will say OK, Caution, or Bad. If it’s Caution, it means there are errors, (bad sectors), but the hard drive or SSD has reallocated them. This is still an indication of a bad drive. If it’s Bad, it means it’s , well, bad. Discontinue use of this drive. SSDs will have percentages instead. These are usually accurate, and measure the amount of life left.

I was running on a HDD with hundreds of bad sectors before I caught it. Before I pulled it, it had almost 1000. That drive was likely to crash at any moment. Luckily, I was able to catch it and copy off all the data.

# Library Genesis

This is the go-to site for most ebooks. Some of the engineering textbooks comes with the solution manual as well. Searching for the title + ""solution manual"" will give you some results. 

# Ch36650lut10n5 (cheggsolutions)

A website which has textbook solutions ripped from chegg. It has quite a lot of books and free, no need to sign up or give any credentials. You can find many textbook solutions that are not on libgen or zlibrary.

# Zlibrary

This is another site where you can try if you can't find it in Library Genesis.
You may need an account if you exceed the download limit. If you do not like to use your personal email, you can opt to use a temporary mail.

# Slader

If you are looking for textbook solutions for free, check Slader. You have to sign up to access materials, after that you can access many solution manuals written by teachers and professors. 
They recently installed a limit, trying to make access to answers a paid service unfortunately. 

# Studylib

As the name itself says it’s like a library, where you can have a large number of assignments and solutions. You can also share your notes with your friends which would help them to solve the problems. It will provide you with a solution for all the subjects. You can also upload your documents and find the solution.

# Pdfdrive

An online PDF search engine that lets you search, preview and download PDFs. According to the site as of right now, there are over 75 million eBooks, magazines, articles, and more that are indexed and discoverable directly on PDF Drive.

# Sci-Hub 

Great place for finding published journal/conference papers that are (usually) paywalled.

# AudioBookBay

If what you want is audiobooks then audiobookbay is the go-to place.

This will usually fail, and they will just say “What?” or “Sorry?” again.

Instead of just repeating yourself, you should slow down, speak more clearly, and say it again but using different words. This will give them time to process your question/statement and formulate a response.

Reviews are sometimes skewed using fake reviews and bot reviews. You'll know when you've got enough real reviews on a seller. The point you should take home here is that buying from walmart .com is not buying from a retailer at all.

Science contends that the scrotum should ideally be about 2 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than the rest of the body for [optimal sperm production](http://livehealthy.chron.com/male-infertility-testicular-temperature-1138.html). If you and your partner are having trouble conceiving, you might want to consider improving living conditions down there for your sperm. No—it doesn’t mean you have to keep an ice pack in your jock at all times, but there are some periodic measures you can take to cool off the boys…at least while you’re actively trying to conceive.

To improve semen quality, some studies have shown that icing your testicles might help boost fertility. Studies have shown that occasionally reducing the temperature of the scrotal area by just a few degrees can reverse male infertility. The enzymes responsible for testosterone and sperm production work most effectively at a certain optimally-cool temperature, so you don’t want to be out of that zone.

Cold balls are the reason why so many guys report a boosted libido from cold showers. ​Studies also show that elevated testicle temperature decreases T production.

So, take an ice pack and hold it up to your balls for 10 minutes a day, preferably before you go to bed. That's when your body makes all its hormones."

2206,YSK: To avoid supposedly healthy foods with chicory root high on the list of ingredients.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Because it's a cheap fiber additive that causes gas and other symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort.

There is a type of fiber called inulin, which in low to moderate amounts is a good prebiotic and source of soluble fiber. However, in large amounts it can cause gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. Chicory root is one of the most common sources of inulin because it's cheap, abundant, and in powder form can be added to almost anything to boost that food's total fiber numbers without significantly impacting taste or texture. Everything from cereals to granola bars to fiber gummies and beyond has it these days.

Chicory root at near the bottom of the ingredients list doesn't worry me. But, when it's towards the top, I avoid it. Also, don't assume because you bought a product once and it didn't have chicory root that it never will. Food manufacturers change up the ingredients subtly all the time and it's not at all uncommon for me to check a box of cereal I've been eating for a long time and suddenly notice it now has it."

Also, if you're having a particularly smelly poop in a multi-stall bathroom, it's okay to have periodic courtesy flushes so your stank isn't just sitting there under you.

2240,"YSK organic fruits and veggies have chemical residues, just not from synthetic pesticides",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Organic produce can include the same chemical compounds as conventional produce sprayed with synthetic pesticides (but at more variable rates), and needs to be rinsed to avoid interesting.

In the US, organic produce can also have chemical residue, but the difference is organics can only be treated with certain classes of chemicals. Most traditional pesticides are chemical compounds produced in the laboratory, and these aren't allowed to be applied to organic crops. Organic crops can have the same chemicals applied, if they're not produced synthetically, but are produced by a bacteria that 'poops' out the same chemical. These safe, beneficial bacteria are sprayed on the plants or soil. The chemical compound is exactly the same, but because it's a biological pesticide, it's okay to apply. Chemical products like pesticides are regulated much, much more heavily than other products.

Chemical applications have to follow a lot of rules, for example,  they usually can't be applied after flowering, and since the fruit develops from a pollinated flower, it's really the leaves and stems that take the chemical load, not the fruit. And vegetables that grow underground like potatoes and onions don't get exposed.

I have a PhD in an agricultural plant genetics, and have worked in the biological agriculture industry (but don't anymore). Personally, I don't worry too much about organic, and believe it's better to buy local (from a conventional or organic farmer). If the produce has been picked more quickly, it will have a better nutritional profile (higher nutrient and micronutrient levels, greater diversity of flavonoids like carotenoids and anthocyanins, and other antioxidants). 

If you want to buy organic, focus on leafy greens and international fruit, especially bananas -- where organic means a better quality of work and life for the people harvesting them."

2246,"YSK: if you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, try sleeping with your curtains open.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Getting good sleep is essential for a healthy day to day life. As someone who slept terribly for a few years, this small tip helped me out immensely.

During my college years, i slept in a room with no windows. Pitch black. I'd wake up at 6am every morning feeling like i had been hit by a truck and it would take me pretty much half of the morning to get my brain going. After that, i moved and had a bedroom with one window over my bed. Out of lazyness, i started sleeping with the curtains open and over time noticed i slept better, woke up fresher and not feeling as heavy as before. I looked it up and basically what happens is that the gradual increase in the level of light in the room will stop the melatonin production in your brain, essentially making you less sleepy over time, even while you are still asleep, so you don't jump from deep sleep state to awake. This will help you get out of bed easier and up and running much faster. Here's a short article on how to sleep better: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/how-to-get-the-perfect-nights-sleep/amp/

If you are employed by any federal government agency full time, you count as a public service worker. But that's not all!

You also may qualify if you work in education, public health, law enforcement, emergency management, elder or disability care, or at a library. The website linked above provides more specific information.

I do not work for the federal government or in finance or with student loans, so I cannot provide advice or any guarantees.

2251,YSK what a grace period on a loan actually means,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Grace periods apply to the length of time am account can be considered past due before a late fee is applied. What most people don't understand is every day you go past the contractual due date you are accruing an additional amount of interest. Now, this amount could come out to 60 cents a day but if a person utilizes a 15 day grace period every month for the entire length of the loan which could be anywhere from 1-30 years it definitely adds up fast. I totally understand not being able to make your payment the same day every time but you can save a lot of money paying in the actual due date as much as possible.

Many people call the left lane the ""fast lane"" because they assume if they are going faster than the speed limit they are in the correct Lane.

This is just not true.

The left lane is for passing folks in the right lane and when you've cleared them and have space, MOVE OVER TO THE RIGHT LANE.

If you ever find that your cell phone battery is compromised, and you can't afford a new phone or repair, you can do it yourself using a soldering iron, some thin wire, I like phone line wire, and solder a regular old 18650 to the contact points of the phone, you just have to cut the battery cable, expose copper on the ribbon, and apply a bead of solder to the + and - connections. Really any lithium battery from 3.7 to 3.8v will work in a phone, and charge with it too. If you'd like proof I can show you in a video, if I get enough requests. I jury-rigged it to hell, samsung Galaxy s8. Ripped the backing off, swapped the battery with a 3.8v cell from an old Hotspot, electrical taped the back, and there you have it, a functional phone, albeit not pretty, but it'll work.

Also, it is used by some companies and government organizations when they are hiring, which makes absolutely no sense since they are far less than accurate and they know that. Even the inventor of the original polygraph machine said it wasn't a lie detector and would be vocal about how it's bullshit. It only has around a 40% success rate when it comes to ""spotting lies"". It has an even lower success rate when you take into account people with anxiety, or people on drugs. Additionally, pathological liars and psychopaths usually pass polygraphs with flying colors. And people can be trained to pass the polygraph, you can alter results just by thinking stressful thoughts and clenching your butthole (seriously). Police know that it's BS and tend to stick to using it as an interrogation tool, but fuck that shit if a company tries to get you to take a polygraph to apply for a job."

WHY YSK: 

So, it turns out that only a small minority of people (less than 20%) live with positive levels of mental health, and over 80% of us will likely experience clinical symptoms at some point in our lives. Mental healthcare is broken pretty much everywhere and many of us will count on digital solutions for help. 

However, there are a lot of problems with those, and you should be aware of them so you can make well-informed decisions about how you take care of your wellbeing. 

To cite just two examples from the article:  
One, AI therapists/chatbots are nowhere close to mimicking human conversations that make you feel connected, heard and seen. They are machine-like, shallow and often insensitive. “For example, one chatbot, when told “I am depressed,” responded dismissively: ‘Maybe the weather is affecting you’.”

Two, mental health apps can create self-stigma. “Users who are experiencing low-level symptoms of a disorder may feel labeled by an app that assumes that they have a clinical diagnosis. Self-stigma from this labeling can be harmful, lowering self-esteem and self-efficacy.”

2276,"YSK: Even if an ambulance doesn’t have lights and siren on, you should give it some space on the road.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Ambulances use lights and siren to cut through traffic and reduce travel time, either traveling to the scene of a sick or hurt person or transporting said person to a hospital or other facility. We use lights and siren when minutes matter.

However, there are many instances in which an ambulance is transporting a patient that doesn’t require lights and siren. There are two main reasons for this: The first is that the patient is stable and doesn’t need to be at the hospital as soon as absolutely possible. The second is that the patient is being transferred back *from* the hospital to wherever he or she came from—nursing home, house, etc. These are called inter-facility transfer, or IFT calls.

Whenever we have a patient in the back, we want to give a smooth ride both for the patient and the paramedic/EMT in the back. Often, we get cut off on the highway by someone who thinks that because we don’t have lights and siren on, anything goes. In addition to being discourteous, the resultant slamming on the brakes causes discomfort for all of us. If a paramedic is starting an IV line and suddenly the truck jolts back, he/she could accidentally stab the patient or him/herself. 

Bottom line, please be courteous around ambulances, lights and siren or not.

In the event that you begin choking while driving, pull over immediately and in your seat try Plan A.

Make a fist (it's best to do this with your non-dominant hand but it doesn't really matter). Put the thumb of your fist against your stomach, below your ribs and above your belly button. Grab your fist firmly with the other hand and jam it AS HARD AS YOU CAN up and under your ribcage with a fast punching movement. You're literally trying to suckerpunch yourself. It doesn't matter if it hurts. If it works you'll have plenty of time to complain. If it doesn't, it won't bother you for long. So lean into it.

If this doesn't work within fifteen seconds (or your arm gets too tired). Stand up, open your car door, and lean over your car door. Same idea (this is commonly done with a chair), quick thrusts until the object clears from your throat.

A lot of people are taught the chair technique, but almost nobody knows that you can use a car door with the same training and results.

2283,YSK: “Ms.” is a marriage-neutral honorific for women and used exactly the same as “Mr.” is used for men,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: You should know this so you can select the appropriate term to use when addressing women in formal contexts, and to avoid misinterpreting this term. I often see a lot of confusion and misconceptions about this term. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms.

""Miss,"" ""Mrs."" and ""Ms."" are all abbreviations of ""Mistress."" Originally, all three abbreviations were in common use and used interchangeably, but over time ""Miss"" came to mean an unmarried woman, ""Mrs."" a married woman, and ""Ms."" fell out of favor. This forced women to be addressed according to their marital status, while ""Mr."" (short for Mister) remained marriage-neutral. 

Recently, ""Ms."" (pronounced ""mizz"") has been revived as a marriage neutral honorific for women and it has become increasingly popular. 

A few misconceptions I've noticed: 

* People think ""Ms."" means a woman is divorced or widowed (it does not- though divorced women might be more likely to use it)

* People think ""Ms."" is short for ""miss"" and means the same thing (it does not- Miss means an unmarried woman, Ms. is marriage-neutral).

* People think ""Ms."" is pronounced the same as ""miss."" (some regional accents pronounce ""miss"" as ""mizz"" so in those places they are pronounced similarly, but for places where ""miss"" is pronounced with an s sound they are pronounced differently). 

So  in conclusion, if you're not sure if a woman is married (or you want to just skip the whole marriage issue altogether) you can use the honorific Ms. Use it exactly how you would use ""Mr."" for men. 

Bonus YSK: a common gender-neural honorific for non-binary people is ""Mx."" (pronounced like ""mix"" or ""meks"")."

I recently traded in an suv that still had an extended maintenance warranty purchased through a major named dealer.

I find the finance manager and asked the same question. And again….. was greeted with hesitation. He eventually steers me to the proper process to receive a refund, but the hinkyness to it was all to shady as they made me feel I was stealing from them.

2300,YSK what percentage points are.,YouShouldKnow,"The notion of ""points"" when discussing percentages tells you what the words ""more"" and ""less"" actually mean -- the word ""points"" in these cases means addition instead of multiplication.

For example, if you are negotiating for royalties on a project, and the opening offer is for 10% of the profits. Asking for 5% more is very different than asking for 5 percentage points more! Asking for five percentage points more than 10% means 10%+5%=15%, whereas 5% more then 10% means 10% + (10% x 5%) = 10.5%.

Why YSK: Without the notion of percentage points, discussing percentages is ambiguous. This will definitely come up when refinancing your house.

As another example, a home loan might be 3% per year. If you are renegotiating the loan for lower monthly payments, they may mention increasing the percentage by some number, like 1.5 percentage points. That means your new interest rate will be 3% + 1.5% = 4.5%. This sounds small, but really your interest rate just went up by 50%!!"

And 5'9 is still pretty tall, you can reach most high shelves and the tops of the fridge. And for my guys in the lower range let me tell you, have a taller partner  is pretty cool cause you get to either be the little spoon or the jet pack while cuddling and both are a good time. 

Don't let your height be something that hold you back or keeps you down because it's not a big deal, and honestly as a 5'10-5'11 guy (depends on the time of day) the world just seems more comfortable if your a bit shorter. So accept it and let your confidence grow."

Well overnight our cat chewed on some of the leaves (normally chews on grass in the yard) and swallowed a piece smaller than 3 millimeters around. As it turns out, if untreated within a very short time period this causes kidney failure for felines and within 48 hours death. We had a friends cat die from a similar thing only a couple months ago and after realizing the type of flower our cat chewed on took him to the emergency vet. 

He's been at the vet for the past three days, and while he isn't out of the woods yet things are looking hopeful with toxicity levels returning to normal. We told our friends who's cat passed away from a similar poisoning that he's an angel kitty, who helped us hopefully save him.  

Our vet said they normally don't show signs until it's too late. So if you have cats, don't buy lilies or plant them in your garden as pollen negatively impacts them as well.

If you buy the smaller heater, you'll still get the same amount of heat, using the same amount of electricity as the larger heater, while saving money.

The First Law of Thermodynamics (aka The Law of Conservation of Energy) cannot be broken, and you should not allow advertising and packing to convince you otherwise.

Features to actually consider when purchasing a heater:

A fan; forcing the air to move through the heater will help circulate the heat better throughout the room.

The thermostat (or lack thereof) and its accuracy; digital thermostats tend to be more accurate, and easier to interpret.

A timer, for automatic shutoff."

CBIT is a behavior therapy for tics that has been proven in research to help reduce tic severity for over half of people who try it, without medications. CBIT involves education about tics, skill-based lessons and daily practice. TicHelper leads you through the most important components of CBIT therapy via an interactive self-help platform. It's designed for kids, but also works for older teens and adults (who would just complete the parent components themselves). The cost is only $150 USD for the entire 8-week access.

Why YSK - 1 person in 100 lives with a tic disorder but there are only of a handful of specialists trained in CBIT. This self-help platform makes this effective therapy approach available anywhere in the world.

Reason 2: Because yaoi has become super popular. Yaoi is usually written by straight women. Do not trust yaoi for how gay relationships typically are (not that there is a ""typical"" gay relationship).

Reason 3: Because this stereotype has become so pervasive, that even gay men sometimes believe it."

For example, cash prices for my meds at Walmart is $36 and at HEB it is $18.65.  After asking about the additional discount card, my total was $11.65.  It would have been a waste of almost $25 for me to purchase them from WalMart and I saved an additional $7 off the list price at HEB just by asking a simple question."

2391,"YSK that ""Rape Kits"" can be performed up to 72 hours after the assault, sometimes even longer.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Rape kits are the best (and really only) way to find evidence for rape.

72 hours is around the window in which DNA evidence is able to be collected. Other evidence like torn clothing will often be taken because it's now evidence of a crime.

You also don't have to accuse your assailant right away, you can wait the entire duration of the statute of limitations for that. If you or someone you know is a victim, please have a rape kit performed. You may not want to accuse them now, but you may in the future and this is really the only way to gather cold hard evidence. 

Also understand that it is a stressful and invasive procedure.

If you do not want to have the procedure performed, that's your choice. If you don't want to think about it and just want to move on, that's okay. This is just the best tool to achieve justice.

2394,YSK: A sudden loss of vision on one side of your visual field is a sign of a stroke,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Today is World Sight Day, so I thought I would re-share an important but underknown fact about strokes. Nearly 56% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as [Hemianopia](https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/fulltext/2006/09000/homonymous_hemianopia_in_stroke.5.aspx) and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.

The common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.

So, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones. Stay safe and take care!"

# Library Genesis

This is the go-to site for most ebooks. Some of the engineering textbooks comes with the solution manual as well. Searching for the title + ""solution manual"" will give you some results. 

# Ch36650lut10n5 (cheggsolutions)

A website which has textbook solutions ripped from chegg. It has quite a lot of books and free, no need to sign up or give any credentials. You can find many textbook solutions that are not on libgen or zlibrary.

# Zlibrary

This is another site where you can try if you can't find it in Library Genesis.
You may need an account if you exceed the download limit. If you do not like to use your personal email, you can opt to use a temporary mail.

# Slader

If you are looking for textbook solutions for free, check Slader. You have to sign up to access materials, after that you can access many solution manuals written by teachers and professors. 
They recently installed a limit, trying to make access to answers a paid service unfortunately. 

# Studylib

As the name itself says it’s like a library, where you can have a large number of assignments and solutions. You can also share your notes with your friends which would help them to solve the problems. It will provide you with a solution for all the subjects. You can also upload your documents and find the solution.

# Pdfdrive

An online PDF search engine that lets you search, preview and download PDFs. According to the site as of right now, there are over 75 million eBooks, magazines, articles, and more that are indexed and discoverable directly on PDF Drive.

# Sci-Hub 

Great place for finding published journal/conference papers that are (usually) paywalled.

# AudioBookBay

If what you want is audiobooks then audiobookbay is the go-to place.

Good luck on your new semester everyone!"
2428,YSK the best way to wash your car with minimum scratches is with a sponge and NOT a contactless pressure wash.,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: this is a common misconception that people have and I can understand why, it seems logical that wiping dirt off with a sponge will leave more scratches than if you don’t touch the dirt and just pressure wash it off. But for the reasons I’ll explain below this isn’t true. 

First off we need to understand what causes scratches and swirl marks on the paint. And that’s tiny dirt particles being pushed into the surface when you wipe it. 

“So wouldn’t not wiping the car with a sponge minimise this effect since it’s less wiping of dirt on the paint?” 

And the answer is no. Because you will wipe the car dry with a cloth, and scratch it worse when you do.

“Why would you scratch it worse then? The car is clean after a contactless wash.” 

It isn’t. No amount of pressure washing and no amount of chemicals will remove all the dirt from the paint. It will look clean because it’s wet. But if you let it dry without wiping you’ll see that it’s still very much dirty with a thin layer of static dirt stuck to the paint. 
The truth is the strength of chemicals or the pressure it would take to remove this layer will most likely damage your delicate trim pieces and definitely be harmful to your breathing organs, so most countries don’t use them. 

What happens next is you wipe the car dry with a clean dry cloth that is basically wiping the dirt on the paint unprotected. 

“So how is using a sponge better?”

When you use a sponge (or a wash mitt or even a similar cloth you’d dry with) you soak it in soap first. Car made soaps are designed specifically for this and they ‘encapsulate’ dirt in their foam so that it doesn’t scratch the paint. Of course it still does some damage but in reality nowhere near as much. Plus you can squeeze out all the dirty water much easier from the sponge before you clean another panel. You then wash the soap off and are left with nothing but water on your paint. Using a clean dry cloth now won’t damage the paint, because there is no dirt on it. 

So here is the process: 

- power wash the car like you would to remove the majority of dirt. 
- use two buckets one filled with water and car shampoo and one with just water
- take a sponge and soak it in the first bucket, gently clean some parts of the car and then rinse the sponge in the second bucket. 
- repeat until you’ve cleaned every part of the car. 
- wash off the soap (with pressure or not) and wipe dry with a clean microfibre towel or dry with compressed air. 

This way your car will be washed with the least amount of scratching possible.  
It will also look much cleaner if you do it this way."

So long as you try to get in as soon as you can, you can get back some of that money with little effort on your part. 

The big caveat here above other versions of this post in the past is that you need to go in pretty quick after the fee hits (&lt;30-90 days, depending on the bank). Sometimes if the fee is over a certain amount of days banks will no longer be able to reverse the fee, or at least thats how it is at the bank I work at (a major US bank)."

Or worse: they will continue to charge thousands or more in legal battles that they’ll make no progress. 

An insurance policy is a legal contract, companies can’t break that contract for customer service regardless of circumstance. In truth, companies will look for any possible loophole that will allow them to pay a claim. Denying a claim has to go through multiple channels for review, and wastes both company and customer time.

We would change the sheets after every stay, but the bed covers were only washed a couple of times a year, unless there was a clear stain.

There's this high tech company in Silicon Valley and she's a lobby ambassador in one of the buildings - making $16 an hour. Her title is Executive Lobby Ambassador, or ELA. But if you drive some three miles south, you'll find that a McDonald's is hiring, starts at $16.50 with no experience. Additionally, my friend was offered a managerial position overseeing a security crew for $17, when she currently was making about $25 being pulled from one of those contractors pools. Title in lieu of any compensation or benefits."
2460,"YSK: In the US, hospitals are required to help pay for your medical bills if you make under a certain amount of money (typically 200-300% of the Federal Poverty Level). This could potentially cover the entirety of your hospital bill.",YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: You should be aware of the medical care that is available to you, as well as the potential costs. Knowing that your hospital bill may be covered if your financial situation is not ideal could make the difference between life and death.

A provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals must provide a “financial assistance policy” that must “must apply to all emergency and other medically necessary care provided by the hospital facility” in order for the hospital to maintain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit. Seeing as 57% of all hospitals are non-profit, this policy applies to majority of hospitals. If you are uninsured, these policies are most likely to apply to you. However, even insured people can qualify in many situations. 

Simply search "" \*name of hospital\* financial assistance "" and go to the hospital's financial assistance page. Somewhere on that page there should be a document called ""Financial Assistance Policy"", and inside of that it will tell you the qualifying income for total coverage, as well as qualifying income for partial coverage. Please read it thoroughly to understand what you may or may not qualify for. For the most part this only applies to emergent, non-elective, and catastrophic care.. otherwise known as ""medically necessary care"". 

As an example, the hospital closest to me covers my entire hospital bill if I make under 200% of the FPL, which would mean I have to make less than $25,760 if I was a 1 person household, or $53,000 for my family of 4. In addition they will offer partial coverage if I make under 600% of the FPL.

I've seen this mistake happen, twice! Don't risk it. 

To do the manoeuvre, keep your arms straight down at your side, then slowly raise them out to your sides, then over your head, and back down in one continuous move. 

Imagine you're a bird trying to take off in slow motion.

For best results, don't look away. Try to keep keep eye contact with where the driver/pilot would sit so they know you're after their attention. 

Repeat this SLOW flapping until they stop. If you stop early, they might think all is well and drive off. 

This works because it's almost never seen anywhere in the wild where there ISN'T an emergency. And, as such, you're INSTANTLY noticeable."

2480,YSK that rape kits can be performed up to 72 hours after the assault,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: Rape kits are the best (and really the only) way to find clear good evidence of rape. It drastically increases the chance of putting someone behind bars.

You also don't have to accuse your assailant right away (unless you're a minor), you can wait up to a year for that if you aren't comfortable doing so just yet, which is understandable. Evidence will be safely preserved for a varying amount of time that they will be sure to tell you.

Another thing YSK - **Rape kits are and always will be FREE because of the Violence Against Women Act** (even if you're a male victim, it's just the name of the bill). If you **are charged money,** you should contact your local sexual assault service provider.

They will also give you a free pregnancy test and STI exam. 

So, if you are a victim of rape or sexual assault:

Avoid bathing, showering, using the restroom, combing your hair, or cleaning up the area. Avoid changing clothes if possible.

If you must change your clothes, save the clothes you were wearing before or during the assault in a paper bag and bring them to the healthcare facility with you.

Call the National Sexual Assault Hotline -  800.656.HOPE (4673) to ask about where to go and what to do. The procedure may take a couple hours, but these are trained professionals who will support you and walk you through each step. \*this is the American number, it may be different in your country.

Bring a supportive person if you can. This is going to be stressful but worth it in the long run.

If you are a victim of rape or sexual assault, please have a rape kit performed. The average rapist will have multiple victims. You have the opportunity to prevent future assaults and save the wellbeing of others, as well as to put that PoS behind bars. DNA evidence will drastically increase the chance of conviction, rape is extremely difficult to prove under other circumstances.

2482,YSK There's a bill in California that could ban the purchase and use of emergency backup generators,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK:  Backup generators keep water flowing, medical equipment running, and heating systems running when grid power goes out.  Battery based storage is nowhere near as capable as gas-powered generators, lasting only a small fraction of the amount of time a generator will run.  Battery storage is also significantly more expensive.  If generators are banned in California, people will lose the communications, heating, lighting, and medical equipment that they depend on during power outages.  Additionally, people in rural areas who depend on wells for water will not be able to run their well pumps to drink or bathe."
