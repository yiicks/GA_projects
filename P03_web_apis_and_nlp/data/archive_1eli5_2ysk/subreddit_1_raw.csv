11,ELI5: how do sheriff auctions work?,explainlikeimfive,"How do sheriff auctions work? From what I understand is that houses get foreclosed due to not being able to pay the mortgage costs. The lender receives the house, but then turns it over to the county or municipal to be auctioned off. How does the auction price get determined? Do you only pay the auction price and then the property is yours? I see something about liens or second mortgages and whatnot, so does that mean that even if you win the auction placed you may not truly own the property if a second mortgage is taken out? Do you still have to pay off costs from the previous owner outside the auction bidding price? If the tenants still live there or if the property is being rented out?

I live in Texas, but I'm curious about any and all states."

28,ELI5 Google search showing results on the right side of the screen on PC,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5, Kinda the gist of it in the title. Whenever I search for something, popular topics related to it show up on the right hand side of the screen taking up 2/3's of the screen, and the actual topic results end up in the last 1/3rd, making searches a little more tedious than usual. Does anyone else have this issue? For example, look up a celebrity, and in my case, you would see it show up with buttons that would let you explore them, but then all the information is on the right side of the screen... not even the good right side... more like mid right. Then you scroll down and on the bottom past the page numbers for the search, is some of their social media.  You scroll down through a 1/3 occupied screen with nothing and then... social media. Is this a me thing or is this a Google thing, cuz the way it looks is almost like its a google thing. Also I used Keanu as a control, I had searched several other things that came up this way, so it's not a Keanu thing."

It need not be said that as we strive for further accomplishments within our own spectrum of science-- or as the Atheists call it, 'Tramalamado,' our own human cells replicate as bonds are formed inside of us. Is that not why Banks charge interest per-time-spent, simply like other labor costs. This all goes down to my question, is water really... real?

Another way to ask; after all all the components are controlled by software. And the panels are manufactured in a standardised way. How come two monitors from same brand and model have massive calibration difference?

When the power generation of something is expressed as a number of kilowatts, for example, and the total amount of energy generat***ed*** is expressed in kilowatt hours, is it just implied then that the reading for the power is using the same unit of time as whichever is being used to express the amount of energy produced/consumed? Like if you know that the system being discussed is measuring the amount of energy that's being stored or consumed in kWh, then any measures of power regarding that system are just assumed to be in hours as well?

It confuses because, as someone who doesn't understand a lot of the basic science behind electricity, if I think about this in terms of something more relatable, like the rate at which a tank is filled with water, I wouldn't find it very useful if a hose was measuring a rate of water exiting it's mouth at ""5L"", because if I needed to know how quickly the tank was filled using the measurement, I'd need also to know a unit of time in that reading, like 5L/*per minute* for example. That way, if knew the tank was filling at a rate of 5L/per minute, I'd know that in an hour for example, there'd be 300L of water in that tank."

Otherwise, it would have dissipated after 5000 miles and 12 hours (like sound waves).

But even if tsunamis propagate at 100% efficiency, the energy should still be spread out due to the larger radius/circumference.

The radius from the volcano to Tongatapu is 40 miles, which is 250 mi circumference.

The radius from the volcano to West Coast is 5000 miles, 31400 mi circumference.

Shouldn‚Äôt the energy per ‚Äúcircumference‚Äù be 125x less? (31400/ 250)

Intuitively, I would have expected a 3ft tsunami in West Coast to be at least 20ft in Tonga."

Of course this means many eventually accept less when it comes to choosing to settle down and make children, and many aren‚Äôt too bothered to begin with, but given the preference is skewed towards the upper extreme of the bell curve, why are humans not consistently getting an inch taller in every generation? 

Nutrition could be a factor but there have always been middle and upper classes who had few restrictions on their calorific intake and generally married within their own class.

Men do not generally seek a woman of height below X feet or Y cm, so if there is a counteracting factor in that men prefer women who are shorter than them, this factor seems to me weaker than the female preference for tall men."

605,ELI5 how would you go about building a radio in a world where similar technologies didn't exist?,explainlikeimfive,"So for a frame of reference, I am a fantasy author, and I am trying to figure out how the early invention of radios may have worked in a different timeline or world. I know the rough idea (I think) that a radio uses a carrier wave and a sound wave converted to a compatible wave, and it is amplified and broadcast over a frequency to then be picked up by a receiver tuned to that frequency. I think thats about right? [I was using images like this off google to learn that lol](https://images.app.goo.gl/D7X3pdRsjKaytERb6)

but what are the kinds of components that would be needed or how is some of that done?

like breaking it down, 

for the carrier wave, is it just like how a tuning fork works, where you create a vibration via some sort of material? how do you create it?

for the sound wave, how is it converted? if you had a diaphragm of sorts, connected by a wire to the machine amplifying the carrier wave, would that be all you need to add the actual sound signal?  I once saw a clip of someone using essentially a 2x4 and some old wire and a couple nails to make an electric guitar. They didnt even use real pickups but they were able to plug it into a regular amp somehow?

now if you managed to amplify that resultant wave (not sure how you do that either, something maybe along the lines of coils and magnets?) and pump it out over an antennae, how would you then manage to recieve it?

also, what stages am I missing?

Basically how would someone in the equivalent of medieval times be able to macguyver a radio?

654,ELI5: How does Polaris (North Star) remain the center of star trail photos?,explainlikeimfive,"When you take a long exposure photo of the sky at night, the result is many circular trails of light surrounding a central star (Polaris). I still can't wrap my head around how this seemingly remains a constant with all the different orbital motions (spin, rotation, tilt, wobble) that earth is continously going through. 

I know it's said that Polaris hasn't *always* been the North Star or center of rotation in the sky, and that it supposedly shifts over many hundreds of years. But, how is it possible to remain constant for *any amoung of time* with us spinning around a wobbling axis at around 1000 MPH, while we rotate around the sun, and the entire solar system is rotating? Shouldn't that mean there are three different axises of rotation and the center of any star trail photo would be changing daily if not minute-by-minute?

I have also heard that this phenomena remains constant because the stars are just *too far* away (trillions of miles) for the movement to be discernable/ noticable.. which makes even less sense to me. -If you attached a laser pointer to a gently rotating, wobbling object, and aim it at a very close surface, the amount of movent of the beam on the surface might be very minimal/ negligable. But, if you aim it at a very distant surface (trillions of miles away) the amount of movent will be exponentially more significant. The same should be true for a fixed camera lens perspective, especially over the course of hundreds of years.

So I guess what I'm saying is; how does our axis of spin continuously align with Polaris while that axis is also on a wobble, and that wobbling axis of earth is rotating within an also-rotating solar system, AND while everything in the cosmos is constantly expanding."

I have four Klipsch R-41M bookshelf speakers and a Denon AVR-2308CI. I have a Front A and B set of speakers with two channels (L and R) each on my receiver. It's saying on the back that if I use A \*OR\* B, it's rated for 6-16 ohms of impedance. If I use A \*AND\* B, it's rated for 12-16 ohms of impedance. 

I don't have a center speaker so I was planning on just setting this up in parallel (is that right? 2 wires per speaker, a + and -) and having one speaker per channel and having both A and B active. My foggy brain can't get a grasp on the ohms ratings and how to safely hook them up. From what I'm able to grasp is that I really don't want the speakers to be below the ohm rating for my receiver.

When you see an addict in a documentary or in real life you notice those things in their face, but personally I always equated it to faster dental decay/teeth loss which changes the overall structure of the face, but that doesn't apply to everyone.

This person said they wanted world peace and I asked them to describe what exactly that meant and they said
&gt; What that means is there's enough strife in the whole babylon kingdom that we as a world community want peace and respect to live our days free from persecution and retribution. No War, or call to arms. Now more than ever, the earth needs guardians whom are responsible and accountable for their actions. A consciously led community through Love and harmonious interaction. Yes, differences certainly arise, but can't we all smile a little more? Fucking - forgiveness, for our malice and imperfections that we don't push the envelope to hatred and persecution for differing tit for tat I can't see the necessity to why we as a humanity have to stoop to fussing and fighting. Beyond comprehension in MSM public narrative.

Basically, is it using some metric that's not just how much of a core it's using (e.g. 500% for 5 cores), or is there a reporting error, or something?"

So if they hadn't been obese they would have survived. Equally, if they hadn't gotten the disease they wouldn't have died. What's the cause of death? Obesity or the disease? Intuitively I want to say the disease, but I feel this has more to do with the fact that diseases (with high mortality) are rare but obesity is not.

Grabbed off the first Google link is an explanation :
""pork has a lower environmental impact than beef. Of note, pork producers can expect to use at least 75% less water than beef producers.""

I wondering - does this have to do with the efficiency of protein metabolism/growth for animals? Eg, feed a cow 10k calories, it grows 5kg, while a piggy grows 15kg.

My assumption is that 10k calories results in the same CO2 and methane when broken down by the animals.

Is my assumption incorrect? Please ELI5!"

1375,ELI5: How are salaries not experiencing devaluation? Where will the pay increases come from?,explainlikeimfive,"I see many industries (especially the Service and Hospitality sector) significantly raising wages.  I just read that King Soopers (Kroeger-esque grocery chain) workers just went on strike demanding at least $6 per hour raise.  How does this not cause devaluation of other salaries/incomes? 

Here‚Äôs an example 

Assume a grocery store employee is making $13 an hour (that‚Äôs the googled rate for a King Soopers deli clerk in my area).  A $6 per hour increase is $19 an hour, roughly a 45% increase

Now take someone who earns $60,000  a year in salary.  I think it‚Äôs safe to say this income/salary will not quickly increase by $27000 (45%) to $87,000.    In fact, such a significant increase in income would take many years, maybe even a decade (depending on too many factors to consider)

In this example, isn‚Äôt the salaried income experiencing an economic devaluation?

Assuming the salaried position is one that takes longer term schooling/certification/apprenticeship (pharmacist, teacher, plumber, electrician) doesn‚Äôt the large percentage pay increase devalue those skills in the market?

Please note: I‚Äôm not for/against the strikes happening in many of the sectors as workers seek better working conditions and wages.  This is not a social commentary question, rather I‚Äôm just trying to wrap my small brain around the idea of these large percentage pay increases and the economic  impact.  Maybe the answer is as simple as these sectors have been so grossly underpaid and this is just a necessary (albeit too long in coming) correction.  

I just don‚Äôt understand what the long term impacts to other positions and to the overall economy will be.  If time has taught me anything it‚Äôs that the companies are not simply going to raise wages and take it out of their profits, that‚Äôs for sure."

1391,"ELI5: The Relationship between Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi",explainlikeimfive,"Actually, I'm here to answer this for everyone else. I will not reveal my source at this point in time.

Here‚Äôs what I know.

Mario and Luigi are twin brothers. Wario and Waluigi are twin brothers. The sets are actually cousins and are part of a very old, very well established royal italian bloodline. They are indeed rivals. Their fathers are twin brothers which creates the tension of the family‚Äîwho gets the inheritance, who gets to carry on the precious royal family bloodline? Their fathers are still alive at this point, so the battle exists between the cousin sets, not the brother sets. The brothers have banded together to fight for their current familial set. This is indicated by the fact that all four are single men, they are still on their journey to find their woman (ie the princesses), and at this stage have no children and have not started their own lines. There cannot be a fight between the brothers (ie why wouldn‚Äôt mario then war with luigi) at this point in time, because they must first protect the line that exists one generation back. The fraternal battle right now is between their fathers, the next-in-line.

The fact that they are royal is indicated by their garb. In the games, we only see their laymen‚Äôs clothing. First and foremost, we can tell they are related because of their physical appearance being practically identical. We can tell they are royal because of the consistency of their outfits also being identical. There is a pattern there. We can also tell they are royal because each has two distinct colors; mario: red/blue; luigi: green/blue; wario: yellow/purple; waluigi: indigo/purple. While we only see them in laymen‚Äôs clothing, their royalty is indicated by the fact that each of them is wearing white gloves. We do not know what their family crests look like; however if we were to see their true royal garb it would resemble and is based on the traditional italian harlequin of the italian commedia del arte. For those who do not know what this looks like, it would be a two-colored diamond-chequed (two colors are required to form the essentially most basic diamond harlequin pattern; each character has two colors) leotard onesie-looking renaissance suit, with the frilly white collar and cuffs, complete with lithe little booties. So too are the actual characters of the game (though we see them in laymen‚Äôs garb) based off the commedia del arte harlequin, but I will not go into that now. The mario games are very theatrical, i‚Äôll just leave it there.

Now let‚Äôs approach what they in the game actually do: they are plumbers. What do they deal with? Lines. This is a direct metaphor for family lines. What do plumbers do? They protect, develop, repair, structure, create and dictate pipelines. What is the responsibility and duty of the male heir? To protect, direct and sustain the family lines. What do pipelines carry? Shit. Yes, I said shit. What is shit? We typically think of it as negative ‚Äúwaste‚Äù. But shit is actually the richest fertilizer there is. It is a form of wealth in that it is not immediately used as an energy resource and is therefore a byproduct of your body‚Äî Pipelines carry shit and then it accumulates; essentially shit is a resource that creates and sustains future life (ie = resource that is not immediately used but accumulates and is used for future sustenance). The male heir‚Äôs duty is to protect and sustain his lines. Whatever he produces in his lifetime is a byproduct of his lifetime; whatever wealth he accumulates is an energy resource not immediately used for his life but is intended to be passed along to fertilize, sustain and carry on his future generations. What else do pipelines carry? Water. Water is the key to life, the most precious element and resource on this planet. Do not be fooled by the fact that these characters are portrayed as lowly plumbers. This is a very distinguished, distinct metaphor for these royal individuals and their familial battle for the throne.

They are cousins. And rivals. But the tension of them being related is too precious of a dynamic for the Japanese to not have embedded in the story, ultimately at the end of the day. 

Enough said."

1439,ELI5 - Making a finance question - suggestion,explainlikeimfive,"Helping my daughter with coming up a question for her Finance class, which she is to present and solve on PPT. It must be related to NPV/capital budgeting/investment decision, etc.

So far, we have come up with a scenario where a company can choose two investment projects. One is to buy a software for 100 million, which is expected to yield 10 million additional profit per year for ten upcoming years. The second one has NPV of 33 million. Interest rate at 10%. Which one to choose?

The answer to this would be to see which has highest NPV. First investment NPV: -100 + 100 / 1,10\^10. If the NPV is lower than 33, then invest in second project, and vice versa. 

However, this is fairly easy, and we wanted to create this question but make it a bit more mathematically challenge. What information can we add to the question? I thought about adding: revenue would be 110, while additional cost, beside investment cost would be 10 million, hence profit, which gives us 100 million for first investment -- but that is barely challenging information to add. I was thinking about aspects such profit margin, ROI, growth rate, market share, break-even, etc. 

The question above takes 20-30 to solve, and from my understanding the instruction requires that the question takes about 3 minute to solve (even if that is highly dependant on who is solving it).

1456,ELI5: Copay after Deductible in Health Insurance?,explainlikeimfive,"Hi everyone. I know the that copays, deductibles, and all sorts of confusing health insurance lingo have been discussed on this sub countless times. However, I was wondering if I could have some confusion cleared up regarding my health insurance plan. It goes like this:

My company offers an in-network deductible of $750 for my companies platinum plan. I understand that I need to pay this in full, then my coinsurance kicks in (which covers 90% of the bill). However in the coinsurance section, it says that there is a PCP copay of $25 and a specialist copay of $45. Does this mean that I need to hit $750 before paying for my copay, or that if I see someone besides my PCP or a specialist, I pay $750 and then they will take care of 90%? 

Thank you in advance!"

You see for fiat loans, you are guaranteed atleast 2√ó or 3√ó of your savings, so if you have $200 in savings, you can get upto $600. But for crypto, it's like kinda the opposite.

The explanation is that 30 Hz on a CRT TV has visible flicker, so they needed 60 scans per second in order to avoid that. So they introduced interlacing to solve that problem, so it's all the odd lines 30 fps + all the even lines 30 fps, so half the resolution 60 fps alternating.

Okay, but couldn't they just stick with 30 fps and just had TVs show each frame twice at 60 Hz? Wouldn't that have been easier? That's what they did and do in movie theaters, it's 24 fps but each frame is shown 3 times, so the actual refresh rate is around 72 Hz, and of course modern LCD displays do similar things when displaying 24 or 30 fps video.

Or couldn't they have done 60 fps progressive and just allocated 12 MHz for a TV channel rather than 6 MHz. Was bandwidth really that scarce? There were only 3 channels on TV then."

Anyways, yeah I live with my parents and we don't have bidets or bidets installed on the toilets and I highly doubt they would ever install one, BUT, I am going to college next school year and I want to buy those portable bidets that you can take to the bathroom with you but I have some questions. So like I don't know how to add an image but if you Google ""portable bidet"" it shows some portable bidets that have bottles that you could fill up with water and it has this cap that has this extendable long stick thingy (??) that shoots out water (this is a terrible explanation) but like how the hell would I position it to clean my butt? can bidets also clean your pee area after peeing? 

ALSO, how would I dry the water? People say use a little towel but imagine I try wiping off the water and there is like some waste on it afterwords because the bidet didn't clean well? where the heck would I put the towel? and I would have to use the bidet again to clean up the leftover waste but how would I check again if I'm clean if the towel is now dirty? maybe toilet paper but wouldn't the toilet paper rip? should I do my business then wipe first with toilet paper THEN use the bidet? I'm sorry this is like a whole essay but I just can't go on being dirty"

After about a month she checked my profile and found one of my 2 videos had 1,000 views. she was impressed and said that was pretty good, but I was so confused bc it's not like anyone is following me so the view count seemingly has nothing to do with me?

1903,ELI5 What exactly does LITHA mean (for piercings)?,explainlikeimfive,"21F I'm *fairly* new to piercings. I've had my ears done since I was 8, belly button since 19, and I got my industrial &amp; second holes done last Feb. I basically did the LITHA method for my first 2 piercings unintentionally; but after getting my ears done last year, I did more research on proper aftercare and started using sterile Saline spray pretty often; or at least when I see (and feel) they need cleaning. I heard mixed reviews about both methods. 

On wash days, I don't mind rinsing my ears off in the shower because my hair is already wet, but usually it's wrapped and I try to avoid getting it wet. In the mornings, I'd wash my face in the sink and wouldn't even think about my piercings until they crusted or got bumps (helix side of the industrial). 

Lately I've been trying to improve my hygiene and develop a morning routine of sorts. Instead of just washing my face, I'd run my piercings under the faucet as well‚Äî which gets annoying while trying to avoid my hair‚Äî and I would let them air dry for the most part. When my (still healing) industrial is fully dry, it kinda sticks to the piercing hole and I get an urge to move it around (which I know you shouldn't‚Äî I'm sorry, I pick at things). 

**SO MY QUESTION IS:** When people say to ""LITHA""... What exactly do they mean? Should I just keep running my piercings under the water every morning? Do I even need the Saline spray? Should I be using the Saline *instead* of the faucet? Should I literally just be leaving them alone? Should I put anything on my industrial afterwards to prevent dryness?"

People say that the US government is constantly spending, and the interest on that debt is putting a huge strain on the US economy, and eventually we'll default on our debt and destroy the global economy (especially because the USD is the world's reserve currency). I've heard people say that we should stop raising the debt ceiling, or pass a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution. 

But then I also hear that interest rates are super low, and we'd in fact be wrong to not borrow and spend on infrastructure. It's supposedly a smart time to borrow money, and people say that the US is doing a great job of servicing its debt.

I see a lot of posts comparing athletes of today to athletes from the past like for example Messi and Pele or Maradona and Ronaldo or Michael Jordan and Lebron james

I don‚Äôt agree with athletes of the past playing team sports being better than any athlete playing currently just because of the how the dynamic of the sport has shifted. One of the biggest differences is how good the average player is now. The average player in for example basketball is way better now than than they were in Michael Jordan‚Äôs era. While if we compare in ratios I‚Äôm sure that Michael Jordan was as ahead of the competition as lebron was in his prime but I think if you compare players as is, lebron would be a winner

Also have to look at how training has changed and how technology has advanced and how that affects players

So my question really is why does it make sense to compare them if they are playing in completely different era‚Äôs of the sport

But could be a correlation between the appearance of new black holes and the dilation of space? And going further: what would happen if when all the black holes merged at the end of time, a new singularity was generated in which all matter and antimatter converge, causing a new Big Bang?

In my idea I assume that the matter-antimatter ratio is irrelevant and in the end what is important is the sum of all the original forces/elemental components.

I also imagined a simplified graphical representation of a bubble in which the space-time is the surface of the bubble and black holes are punctures of said surface, which stretches space-time. I'm not sure if this bubble inflates or folds in on itself, which makes irrelevant the content inside the bubble. This bubble should be projected in more dimensions of course.

Given my limited understanding about physics, I can't imagine how the convergence of all the black holes would result in a new singularity and even if this is a valid idea."

2496,ELI5: Are people turned off by sugar the more they age?,explainlikeimfive,"I'm 24. When I was younger I used to binge on sugar. I loved everything - pies, ice cream, donuts, you name it. I'd eat through my Halloween haul within 2 days.

Starting from around 18 yrs old, I noticed I started to crave sugar less and less. Now I'm 24 and I almost can't stand the taste of it. I'll take one bite of anything sweet and it's almost nauseating. It feels like the sweet taste is ten times more overwhelming now compared to when I was younger. I eat exclusively salty foods now.

I've always thought it had to do with age, but my mom is 50 and still loves sugary foods, so I'm not sure. I'm 100% certain it's not just that my tastes have changed. I'm convinced something has happened to me biologically. I know others who've had the same experience. Can anyone help?"
